AB  - BACKGROUND: Pressure ulcers are one of the most common health complaints, which often take months or years to heal, and affect patients' morbidity and quality of  life. Medical options for pressure ulcers are limited. Electroacupuncture (EA)  has been employed to relieve the symptoms for patients with pressure ulcers, but  there is limited clinical evidence for its effectiveness. METHODS/DESIGN: This  study consists of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with two parallel arms: a  control group and an EA group. Both groups will receive standard wound care  (including changing position, using mattresses and cushions, and a good diet) of  five sessions per week for a total of 40 sessions during the 8-week treatment  period. In addition, the EA group will receive the EA intervention. The following  outcome measurements will be used in examination of participants: wound surface  area (WSA), visual analogue scale (VAS), and the proportion of ulcers healed  within trial period (PUHTP). All the outcomes will be evaluated at the start of  the study, at the end of the fourth week, at 8 weeks after randomization, and 1  month after treatment cessation. DISCUSSION: The aim of this study is to evaluate  the effectiveness of EA for the treatment of patients with pressure ulcers. TRIAL  REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical Trial Register: ChiCTR-TRC-11001693.

AB  - The objective of this multicenter open-label randomized study was for evaluating nutrition intervention on pressure ulcer healing. Tube-fed patients with Stages  III to IV pressure ulcers were enrolled. Target energy levels to be given were  the same value as at the time of enrollment or BEE×1.1 (activity factor)×1.1-1.3  (stress factor) in the control group, and BEE×1.1×1.3-1.5 in the intervention  group. Both groups received the feeding formula Racol(®) for 12 weeks, and were  prescribed to have pressure relief mattresses, and to unify the repositioning  method, treatment drugs, and wound dressing materials. Ulcer sizes  (length×width), nutritional state, and adverse events were evaluated. RESULTS OF  THE STUDY: Energy levels administered to the control (n=29) and intervention  (n=21) groups were 29.1±4.9 (mean±SD) and 37.9±6.5 kcal/kg/day, respectively.  Regarding pressure ulcer size, the interaction between the nutrition intervention  and the courses during observational weeks was significant (P<0.001). Similarly,  significant differences were observed with weight, waist circumference, Cu  (P<0.001), suprailiac skinfold thickness (P<0.01), thigh circumference, and  prealbumin (P<0.05), but not with the incidence of adverse events (P=0.360).  Principal component analysis indicated remarkable decreases in ulcer size and  improvement rates of waist circumference and suprailiac skinfold thickness in the  intervention group. Covariance structure analysis showed that nutrition  intervention has a direct effect on reduction in ulcer size. The results  suggested that aggressive nutrient intervention accelerated the pressure ulcer of  wound healing process and had a direct effect on reduction in ulcer size.

TI  - Dressings and topical agents for preventing pressure ulcers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pressure ulcers, which are localised injury to the skin, or underlying tissue or both, occur when people are unable to reposition themselves  to relieve pressure on bony prominences. Pressure ulcers are often difficult to  heal, painful and impact negatively on the individual's quality of life. The cost  implications of pressure ulcer treatment are considerable, compounding the  challenges in providing cost effective, efficient health services. Efforts to  prevent the development of pressure ulcers have focused on nutritional support,  pressure redistributing devices, turning regimes and the application of various  topical agents and dressings designed to maintain healthy skin, relieve pressure  and prevent shearing forces. Although products aimed at preventing pressure  ulcers are widely used, it remains unclear which, if any, of these approaches are  effective in preventing the development of pressure ulcers. OBJECTIVES: To  evaluate the effects of dressings and topical agents on the prevention of  pressure ulcers, in people of any age without existing pressure ulcers, but  considered to be at risk of developing a pressure ulcer, in any healthcare  setting. SEARCH METHODS: In February 2013 we searched the following electronic  databases to identify reports of relevant randomised clinical trials (RCTs): the  Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of  Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library); Database of Abstracts of  Reviews of Effects (The Cochrane Library); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process  & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE; and EBSCO CINAHL. SELECTION  CRITERIA: We included RCTs evaluating the use of dressings, topical agents, or  topical agents with dressings, compared with a different dressing, topical agent,  or combined topical agent and dressing, or no intervention or standard care, with  the aim of preventing the development of a pressure ulcer. DATA COLLECTION AND  ANALYSIS: We assessed trials for their appropriateness for inclusion and for  their risk of bias. This was done by two review authors working independently,  using pre-determined inclusion and quality criteria. MAIN RESULTS: Five trials  (940 participants) of unclear or high risk of bias compared a topical agent with  a placebo. Four of these trials randomised by individual and one by cluster. When  results from the five trials were combined, the risk ratio (RR) was 0.78 (95% CI  0.47 to 1.31; P value 0.35) indicating no overall beneficial effect of the  topical agents. When the cluster randomised trial was omitted from the analysis,  use of topical agents reduced the pressure ulcer incidence by 36%; RR 0.64 (95%  CI 0.49 to 0.83; P value 0.0008).Four trials (561 participants), all of which  were of high or unclear risk of bias, showed that dressings applied over bony  prominences reduced pressure ulcer incidence; RR 0.21 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.51; P  value 0.0006). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence from RCTs to  support or refute the use of topical agents applied over bony prominences to  prevent pressure ulcers. Although the incidence of pressure ulcers was reduced  when dressings were used to protect the skin, results were compromised by the low  quality of the included trials. These trials contained substantial risk of bias  and clinical heterogeneity (variations in populations and interventions);  consequently, results should be interpreted as inconclusive. Further well  designed trials addressing important clinical, quality of life and economic  outcomes are justified, based on the incidence of the problem and the high costs  associated with pressure ulcer management.

AB  - BACKGROUND: L-carnosine (CAR) is an endogenous dipeptide. We aimed to determine the effects of CAR and its zinc complex polaprezinc (PLZ) on pressure ulcer  healing in institutionalized long-term care patients. METHODS: This study was a  nonrandomized controlled trial with a maximum 4-week follow-up. Forty-two  patients with stage II-IV pressure ulcers for 4 or more weeks were allocated to 1  of 3 groups in order of recruitment: the control group (n = 14) was untreated,  the PLZ group (n = 10) orally received 150 mg/d PLZ (containing 116 mg CAR and 34  mg zinc), and the CAR group (n = 18) orally received 116 mg/d CAR. Pressure ulcer  severity was measured weekly using the Pressure Ulcer Scale for Healing (PUSH)  score. RESULTS: At baseline, no significant differences were found among groups  in demographic and nutrition parameters and pressure ulcer characteristics  (severity, size, and staging). After 4 weeks, the rate of pressure ulcer healing,  assessed by the mean weekly improvement in PUSH score, was significantly greater  in the CAR (1.6 ± 0.2, P = .02) and PLZ groups (1.8 ± 0.2, P = .009) than in the  control group (0.8 ± 0.2). The difference between the CAR and PLZ groups was not  significant (P = .73). Actual dietary intakes over this period did not differ  significantly among groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that CAR and PLZ may  almost equally accelerate pressure ulcer healing during 4 weeks. The results need  confirmation by randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pressure ulcers affect as many as 3 million Americans and are major sources of morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. PURPOSE: To summarize  evidence comparing the effectiveness and safety of treatment strategies for  adults with pressure ulcers. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL,  Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials,  Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of  Effects, and Health Technology Assessment Database for English- or  foreign-language studies; reference lists; gray literature; and individual  product packets from manufacturers (January 1985 to October 2012). STUDY  SELECTION: Randomized trials and comparative observational studies of treatments  for pressure ulcers in adults and noncomparative intervention series (n > 50) for  surgical interventions and evaluation of harms. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were  extracted and evaluated for accuracy of the extraction, quality of included  studies, and strength of evidence. DATA SYNTHESIS: 174 studies met inclusion  criteria and 92 evaluated complete wound healing. In comparison with standard  care, placebo, or sham interventions, moderate-strength evidence showed that  air-fluidized beds (5 studies [n = 908]; high consistency), protein-containing  nutritional supplements (12 studies [n = 562]; high consistency), radiant heat  dressings (4 studies [n = 160]; moderate consistency), and electrical stimulation  (9 studies [n = 397]; moderate consistency) improved healing of pressure ulcers.  Low-strength evidence showed that alternating-pressure surfaces, hydrocolloid  dressings, platelet-derived growth factor, and light therapy improved healing of  pressure ulcers. The evidence about harms was limited. LIMITATION: Applicability  of results is limited by study quality, heterogeneity in methods and outcomes,  and inadequate duration to assess complete wound healing. CONCLUSION:  Moderate-strength evidence shows that healing of pressure ulcers in adults is  improved with the use of air-fluidized beds, protein supplementation, radiant  heat dressings, and electrical stimulation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nutrition supplements enriched with immune function enhancing nutrients have been developed to aid wound-healing, although evidence regarding  their effectiveness is limited and systematic reviews have lead to inconsistent  recommendations. The present pragmatic, randomised, prospective open trial  evaluated a wound-specific oral nutrition supplement enriched with arginine,  vitamin C and zinc compared to a standard supplement with respect to outcomes in  patients with chronic wounds in an acute care setting. METHODS: Twenty-four  patients [11 males and 13 females; mean (SD) age: 67.8 (22.3) years] with chronic  wounds (14 diabetic or venous ulcers; 10 pressure ulcers or chronic surgical  wounds) were randomised to receive either a wound-specific supplement (n = 12) or  standard supplement (n = 12) for 4 weeks, with ongoing best wound and nutrition  care for an additional 4 weeks. At baseline, and at 4 and 8 weeks, the rate of  wound-healing, nutritional status, protein and energy intake, quality of life and  product satisfaction were measured. Linear mixed effects modelling with random  intercepts and slopes were fitted to determine whether the wound-specific  nutritional supplement had any effect. RESULTS: There was a significant  improvement in wound-healing in patients receiving the standard nutrition  supplement compared to a wound-specific supplement (P = 0.044), although there  was no effect on nutritional status, dietary intake, quality of life and patient  satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study indicate that a  standard oral nutrition supplement may be more effective at wound-healing than a  specialised wound supplement in this clinical setting.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pressure ulcers are an important source of morbidity and suffering for patients and a formidable burden on caregivers. OBJECTIVES: To assess the  impact of a feeding formula enriched with fish oil on healing of preexisting  pressure ulcers and serum levels of C-reactive protein in critical care patients.  METHODS: Adult patients with pressure ulcers grade II or higher were randomly  allocated to receive either a formula enriched with fish oil or an isocaloric  control formula. Wound healing was assessed by using the Pressure Ulcer Scale for  Healing tool on days 7, 14, and 28. Blood levels of C-reactive protein were  measured on days 0, 7, and 14. RESULTS: Baseline demographics did not differ  between the study (n = 20) and the control (n = 20) groups. The mean score on the  ulcer healing tool increased significantly (P = .02) from day 0 to day 28 in the  control group (from 9.25 [SD, 2.12] to 10.75 [SD, 3.41]) compared with the study  group (from 9.10 [SD, 2.84] to 9.40 [SD, 3.72]). Mean levels of C-reactive  protein decreased significantly (P= .02) from day 0 to day 14 in the study group  (from 191 [SD, 104.4] mg/L to 111.7 [SD, 97.8] mg/L) compared with the control  group (from 145 [SD, 90] mg/L to 139 [SD, 62] mg/L). CONCLUSION: Administration  of a feeding formula enriched with fish oil was associated with decreased  progression of pressure ulcers and a decrease in blood concentrations of  C-reactive protein.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate if a lower dose of arginine in the form of an oral nutritional supplement can show similar benefit in the healing rate of pressure  ulcers compared with the current evidence for 9g of arginine. METHOD:  Twenty-three inpatients with category II, III or IV pressure ulcers were  randomised to receive daily, for 3 weeks, the standard hospital diet plus 4.5 or  9g arginine in the form of a commercial supplement. Pressure ulcer size and  severity was measured weekly (by PUSH tool; pressure ulcer scale for healing; 0=  completely healed, 17= greatest severity). Nutritional status was determined by  Subjective Global Assessment. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in  patients' age, gender, BMI, haemoglobin levels, albumin levels and diagnosis of  diabetes between treatment groups. There was a significant decrease in pressure  ulcer severity over time (p < 0.001), with no evidence of a difference in healing  rate between the two arginine dosages (p=0.991). Based on expected healing time,  patients in both treatment groups were estimated to achieve an almost 2-fold  improvement compared with the historical control group. Patients categorised as  malnourished showed clinically significant impaired healing rates compared with  well nourished patients (p=0.057), although this was unaffected by arginine  dosage (p=0.727). CONCLUSION: Similar clinical benefits in healing of pressure  ulcers can be achieved with a lower dosage of arginine, which can translate into  improved concordance and significant cost-savings for both the health-care  facilities and for patients.

AB  - n-3 Fatty acids are recognised as influencing both wound healing and immunity. We assessed the impact of a fish oil- and micronutrient-enriched formula (study  formula) on the healing of pressure ulcers and on immune function in critically  ill patients in an intensive care unit. A total of forty patients with pressure  ulcers and receiving nutritional support were enrolled (intervention group, n 20,  received study formula; and a control group, n 20, received an isoenergetic  formula). Total and differential leucocyte count and percentage of adhesion  molecule positive granulocyte and lymphocyte cells (CD11a, CD11b, CD18 and CD49b)  were measured on days 0, 7 and 14. Percentage of positive lymphocytes for CD54,  CD49b, CD49d and CD8 were also measured on days 0, 7 and 14. The state of  pressure ulcers was assessed by using the pressure ulcer scale for healing tool  score on days 7, 14 and 28 of treatment. No between-group differences in patient  demographics, anthropometry or diagnostic class were observed. Patients who  received the study formula showed significant increases in the percentage of  positive CD18 and CD11a lymphocytes and of CD49b granulocytes as compared to  controls (P < 0·05). While the severity of pressure ulcers was not significantly  different between the two groups on admission, severity increased significantly  over time for the control group (P < 0·05), but not for the study group. The  present study suggests that a fish oil- and micronutrient-enriched formula may  prevent worsening of pressure ulcers and that this effect may be mediated by an  effect on adhesion molecule expression.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of nutrition intervention on nutritional states and healing of pressure ulcers by standardizing or unified  factors including nursing, care and treatment in a multicenter open randomized  trial. Tube-fed patients with Stage III-IV pressure ulcers were selected. The  control group (30 patients) received the same nutrition management as before  participating in this trial, whereas the intervention group (30 patients) was  given calories in the range of Basal Energy Expenditure (BEE) × 1.1 × 1.3 to 1.5.  The intervention period was 12 weeks. The efficacy and safety were evaluated  based on the nutritional states and the sizes of ulcers (length × width), and on  the incidence of adverse events related to the study, respectively. The calories  administered to the control and intervention groups were 29.1 ± 4.9 and 37.9 ±  6.5 kcal/kg/day, respectively. Significant interactions between the presence or  absence of the intervention and the intervention period were noted for  nutritional states (p<0.001 for body weight, p<0.05 for prealbumin). Similarly,  the size of ulcers differed significantly between subjects in the intervention  group and in the control group (p<0.001). The results suggest that nutrition  intervention could directly enhance the healing process in pressure ulcer  patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of two pressure-ulcer screening tools against clinical judgement in preventing pressure ulcers. DESIGN: A single blind  randomised controlled trial. SETTING: A large metropolitan tertiary hospital.  PARTICIPANTS: 1231 patients admitted to internal medicine or oncology wards.  Patients were excluded if their hospital stay was expected to be 2 days or less.  INTERVENTIONS: Participants allocated to either a Waterlow (n=410) or Ramstadius  (n=411) screening tool group or to a clinical judgement group (n=410) where no  formal risk screening instrument was used. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incidence of  hospital acquired pressure ulcers ascertained by regular direct observation. Use  of any devices for the prevention of pressure ulcers, documentation of a pressure  plan and any dietetic or specialist skin integrity review were recorded. RESULTS:  On admission, 71 (5.8%) patients had an existing pressure ulcer. The incidence of  hospital-acquired pressure ulcers was similar between groups (clinical judgement  28/410 (6.8%); Waterlow 31/411 (7.5%); Ramstadius 22/410 (5.4%), p=0.44).  Significant associations with pressure injury in regression modelling included  requiring a dietetic referral, being admitted from a location other than home and  age over 65 years. CONCLUSION: The authors found no evidence to show that two  common pressure-ulcer risk-assessment tools are superior to clinical judgement to  prevent pressure injury. Resources associated with use of these tools might be  better spent on careful daily skin inspection and improving management targetted  at specific risks. STUDY REGISTRATION: The trial was registered with the  Australian and New Zealand Clinicat Trials Registry (ACTRN 12608000541303).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether or not the use of an arginine-containing nutritional supplement could result in significantly shorter pressure ulcer (PU)  healing times in people with spinal cord injuries living in the community,  compared with a comparative historical control group. METHOD: Eighteen  spinal-cord-injured patients (all part of a hospital spinal outreach service)  received 9 g of a commercial powdered arginine supplement per day until full PU  healing occurred. Healing rates were compared against 17 historical control  patients (as assessed by medical history audit). RESULTS: Baseline  characteristics (age, gender, injury level and time) were similar between groups.  Mean ulcer healing times were 10.5 +/- 1.3 weeks versus 21 +/- 3.7 weeks (p<0.05)  in the intervention and control groups respectively. Comparison of healing rates  in the intervention group against expected healing rates derived from the medical  literature showed that intervention patients had a significantly shorter mean  healing time (category 2 PU: 5.5+/-1.3 weeks versus 13.4 weeks; category 3 PU:  12.5 +/- 1.9 weeks versus 18.2 weeks; category 4 PU: 14.4 +/- 4.8 weeks versus  22.1 weeks). A diagnosis of diabetes did not significantly alter healing rates in  either group. CONCLUSION: Results from this observational study show a promising  benefit of arginine supplementation on PU healing for individuals with spinal  cord injury living in the community.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We investigated the potential of a high-protein, arginine- and micronutrient-enriched oral nutritional supplement (ONS) to improve healing of  pressure ulcers in non-malnourished patients who would usually not be considered  for extra nutritional support. METHODS: Forty-three non-malnourished subjects  with stage III or IV pressure ulcers were included in a multicountry, randomized,  controlled, double-blind, parallel group trial. They were offered 200 mL of the  specific ONS or a non-caloric control product three times per day, in addition to  their regular diet and standard wound care, for a maximum of 8 wk. Results were  compared with repeated-measures mixed models (RMMM), analysis of variance, or  Fisher's exact tests for categorical parameters. RESULTS: Supplementation with  the specific ONS accelerated pressure ulcer healing, indicated by a significantly  different decrease in ulcer size compared with the control, over the period of 8  wk (P <or= 0.016, RMMM). The decrease in severity score (Pressure Ulcer Scale for  Healing) in the supplemented group differed significantly (P <or= 0.033, RMMM)  from the control. Moreover, significantly fewer dressings were required per week  in the ONS group compared with the control (P <or= 0.045, RMMM) and less time was  spent per week on changing the dressings (P <or= 0.022, RMMM). At the end of the  study, blood vitamin C levels had significantly increased in the ONS group  compared with the control (P = 0.015, analysis of variance). CONCLUSION: Specific  nutritional supplementation accelerated healing of pressure ulcers and decreased  wound care intensity in non-malnourished patients, which is likely to decrease  overall costs of pressure ulcer treatment.

T2  - The Annals of pharmacotherapy
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review recent literature regarding therapeutic management of pressure ulcers and to discuss the potential implications of the newly recognized  entity, deep tissue injury (DTI). DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search was conducted of  pressure ulcer therapy published between January 2001 and October 2009. Key  search terms included pressure ulcers, deep tissue injury, nutrition,  antibiotics, and therapy. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Comparative  clinical trials involving pharmacologic agents in the treatment of pressure  ulcers and DTI were evaluated. Included trials were those with defined  interventions and outcome parameters for wound healing. DATA SYNTHESIS: Pressure  ulcers remain an important issue in the care of elderly and immobilized patients.  DTI has been recently added by the National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel as a  separate category in the staging of pressure ulcers. There is currently a lack of  consensus on how to identify and treat DTI, but preventive measures typically  employed in the management of all pressure ulcers have been recommended. Recent  studies on topical phenytoin, silver preparations, and growth factors report  benefit in the management of pressure ulcers. However, studies evaluating these  treatment approaches often lack the sample size necessary to adequately support  recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: Determining the extent of tissue damage in DTI is  currently not possible. Therefore, management recommendations focus on limiting  extension of the ulcer stage through preventive strategies. Routine use of  topical phenytoin, silver preparations, or growth factors in therapy of pressure  ulcers cannot be recommended until more data from rigorously designed studies are  available.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pressure ulcers affect predominantly the elderly and nutritional status is a known risk factor. Guidelines on pressure ulcers provide  recommendation on nutritional management. Ornithine alpha-ketoglutarate (OKG) is  an adjuvant treatment in undernourished elderly patients or in patients with  hypercatabolism states. It is a precursor of different amino-acids which play a  role in the process of healing. The objective of the study is to determine the  efficacy of OKG on pressure ulcer area reduction after six weeks of treatment.  DESIGN: Multi-centre, international, randomized, comparative, double blind,  parallel groups, placebo-controlled study. PARTICIPANTS: 160 patients (ITT  population) aged over 60 years with a heel pressure ulcer at stage II or III.  INTERVENTION: Patients received OKG (n=85) or placebo (n=75) once a day for 6  weeks. MEASUREMENTS: Ulcer area was measured each week, using a tracer. The  primary endpoint was the percentage reduction of the surface at the final visit:  [(Wound areatn - Wound areat0)/ (Wound areat0)]. RESULTS: At inclusion, ulcer  area distribution deviated from normal distribution (median ulcer area OKG 6.6  cm(2), placebo 3.9 cm2, p=0.044, Mann-Whitney test). As healing is strongly  related to baseline ulcer area, the abnormal distribution was a major bias.  Therefore it was decided to perform the analysis on 2 sub-groups of patients  according to the mean ulcer area, i.e. above or below 8 cm2. The mean wound area  reduction for baseline area <or= 8 cm2 are -59.5 +/- 71.4% and -54.0 +/- 69.0%  for the OKG group and placebo groups respectively (p=0.477, Mann-Whitney test).  In the group with baseline pressure ulcer area > 8 cm2 no between group  differences on either parameter was detected. When closure rate is considered, a  significant difference in favor of OKG group is observed (- 0.07 cm2/day in the  OKG group and - 0.04 cm2/day in the placebo groups respectively p=0.007,  Mann-Whitney test). Thirty serious adverse events were reported in 28 patients  (15 allocated to OKG and 13 to placebo). None of them was considered treatment  related. CONCLUSION: This clinical trial supports a potential benefit of OKG 10g  daily in the subgroup of patients with pressure ulcers <or= 8 cm2 surface area in  elderly population when associated with debridement together with wound  management according to pressure ulcer guidelines. However this study highlights  methodological difficulties to perform clinical trials in old-old patients that  may affect the robustness of the results for this type of study.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether a disease-specific nutritional approach is more beneficial than a standard dietary approach to the healing of pressure  ulcers (PUs) in institutionalized elderly patients. DESIGN: Twelve-week follow-up  randomized controlled trial (RCT). SETTING: Four long-term care facilities in the  province of Como, Italy. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-eight elderly subjects with Stage  II, III, and IV PUs of recent onset (<1-month history). INTERVENTION: All 28  patients received 30 kcal/kg per day nutritional support; of these, 15 received  standard nutrition (hospital diet or standard enteral formula; 16% calories from  protein), whereas 13 were administered a disease-specific nutrition treatment  consisting of the standard diet plus a 400-mL oral supplement or specific enteral  formula enriched with protein (20% of the total calories), arginine, zinc, and  vitamin C (P<.001 for all nutrients vs control). MEASUREMENTS: Ulcer healing was  evaluated using the Pressure Ulcer Scale for Healing (PUSH; 0=complete healing,  17=greatest severity) tool and area measurement (mm(2) and %). RESULTS: The  sampled groups were well matched for age, sex, nutritional status, oral intake,  type of feeding, and ulcer severity. After 12 weeks, both groups showed  significant improvement (P<.001). The treatment produced a higher rate of  healing, the PUSH score revealing a significant difference at Week 12 (-6.1+/-2.7  vs -3.3+/-2.4; P<.05) and the reduction in ulcer surface area significantly  higher in the treated patients already by Week 8 (-1,140.9+/-669.2 mm(2) vs  -571.7+/-391.3 mm(2); P<.05 and approximately 57% vs approximately 33%; P<.02).  CONCLUSION: The rate of PU healing appears to accelerate when a nutrition formula  enriched with protein, arginine, zinc, and vitamin C is administered, making such  a formula preferable to a standardized one, but the present data require further  confirmation by high-quality RCTs conducted on a larger scale.

AB  - CONTEXT: Many treatments for pressure ulcers are promoted, but their relative efficacy is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review published randomized  controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating therapies for pressure ulcers. DATA SOURCES  AND STUDY SELECTION: The databases of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL were searched  (from inception through August 23, 2008) to identify relevant RCTs published in  the English language. DATA EXTRACTION: Methodological characteristics and  outcomes were extracted by 3 investigators. DATA SYNTHESIS: A total of 103 RCTs  met inclusion criteria. Of these, 83 did not provide sufficient information about  authors' potential financial conflicts of interest. Methodological quality was  variable. Most trials were conducted in acute care (38 [37%]), mixed care (25  [24%]), or long-term care (22 [21%]) settings. Among 12 RCTs evaluating support  surfaces, no clear evidence favored one support surface over another. No trials  compared a specialized support surface with a standard mattress and  repositioning. Among 7 RCTs evaluating nutritional supplements, 1 higher-quality  trial found that protein supplementation of long-term care residents improved  wound healing compared with placebo (improvement in Pressure Ulcer Scale for  Healing mean [SD] score of 3.55 [4.66] vs 3.22 [4.11], respectively; P < .05).  Other nutritional supplement RCTs showed mixed results. Among 54 RCTs evaluating  absorbent wound dressings, 1 found calcium alginate dressings improved healing  compared with dextranomer paste (mean wound surface area reduction per week, 2.39  cm(2) vs 0.27 cm(2), respectively; P<.001). No other dressing was superior to  alternatives. Among 9 RCTs evaluating biological agents, several trials reported  benefits with different topical growth factors. However, the incremental benefit  of these biological agents over less expensive standard wound care remains  uncertain. No clear benefit was identified in 21 RCTs evaluating adjunctive  therapies including electric current, ultrasound, light therapy, and vacuum  therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Little evidence supports the use of a specific support  surface or dressing over other alternatives. Similarly, there is little evidence  to support routine nutritional supplementation or adjunctive therapies compared  with standard care.

T2  - Paediatric nursing
AB  - Children who are at risk of pressure ulcers need to be identified so that preventative measures can be taken. Most paediatric pressure ulcer risk  assessment scales were developed using clinical experience, or by modifying adult  scales. The Glamorgan Paediatric Pressure Ulcer Risk Assessment Scale was  developed using detailed paediatric inpatient data. AIM: To establish whether the  inter-rater reliability of the Glamorgan scale was adequate for use in clinical  practice. METHOD: Fifteen qualified nurses randomly selected from staff working  on seven paediatric wards or units in a large tertiary referral hospital have  participated in the study to date. Nurses asked permission from the children and  parents in their care to collect anonymous data in the risk assessment section of  the Glamorgan scale. The nurse and the researcher independently assessed the  child's risk. Paired risk assessments were later compared and analysed using  SPSS. RESULTS: The total risk scores ranged from 15 to 34 (high to very high  risk). There was 100 per cent agreement on all items except for 'inadequate  nutrition'. CONCLUSION: These preliminary data indicate that the risk assessment  scale is reliable. More research on the reliability and validity of this tool  with specific paediatric patient groups should be carried out, ideally comparing  the performance of this tool with other published paediatric pressure ulcer risk  assessment tools.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Pressure ulcers are a significant burden in the ICU. Many factors have found to be associated with pressure ulcers including malnutrition.  While it has been recognized that high protein diets decrease the incidence of  pressure ulcers, the role of lipids as well as vitamins and antioxidants remains  unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the preventive and healing effects  of an enteral diet enriched in eicosapentanoic acid (EPA) and gamma-linolenic  acid (GLA) and vitamins (vitamins A, C and E) on pressure ulcers. METHODS: One  hundred patients with acute lung injury were included in a larger study  evaluating the effects of lipids and vitamins on respiratory function. A  secondary end point, occurrence and healing of pressure ulcers was included. A  diet enriched in lipids (EPA, GLA) and vitamins (vitamins A, C and E) was  compared with a diet similar in macronutrient composition. The occurrence and  healing of pressure ulcers was evaluated according to the National Pressure Ulcer  Panel. Nutritional assessment included calorie intake, resting energy  expenditure, levels of serum prealbumin, albumin, vitamins A and E, zinc and  copper. C-reactive protein and procalcitonin were also measured. RESULTS:  Patient's age, severity of disease and gender distribution were similar in the  two groups. The study group had a higher body mass index. At baseline, the  pressure ulcer score was similar in the two groups A significantly lower rate of  occurrence of new pressure ulcers was observed in the study group compared to the  control group (p<0.05). No difference was observed in the healing of existing  pressure ulcers in the study as opposed to the control group. There was no  significant difference in the nutritional parameters between the two groups.  CONCLUSIONS: A diet enriched with EPA, GLA and vitamins A, C and E is associated  with a significantly lower occurrence of new pressure ulcers in critically ill  patients with acute lung injury.

T2  - Journal of clinical pathology
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pressure ulcers represent a major cost to the healthcare systems of the world but preventative measures are expensive and could be better targeted.  Current risk screening mechanisms are often subjective and could be improved.  AIMS: To evaluate whether a biochemical assessment tool (Prognostic Inflammatory  and Nutritional Index; PINI) based on measurement of albumin, alpha1-acid  glycoprotein, C-reactive protein, and prealbumin is of value in estimating the  prognosis of patients with pressure ulcers of European Pressure Ulcer Advisory  Panel grade 1 and above. METHODS: Serum samples were collected from patients  participating in a clinical trial of a pressure ulcer preventing mattress. These  were analysed for the markers listed above and the PINI calculated. PINI was then  evaluated against patient outcome. RESULTS: A statistically significant  difference between PINI values in patients whose pressure ulcers improved and  those whose ulcers worsened was found in parametric testing, but significance was  not achieved in non-parametric testing. A receiver operating characteristic plot  showed the PINI was superior to chance in estimating prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: The  PINI appears to offer a potential route to improving pressure ulcer risk  estimation and thus allocation of scarce equipment to improve prevention.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Nutrients putatively implicated in pressure ulcer healing were evaluated in a clinical setting. METHODS: Sixteen inpatients with a stage 2, 3 or  4 pressure ulcer randomised to receive daily a standard hospital diet; a standard  diet plus two high-protein/energy supplements; or a standard diet plus two  high-protein/energy supplements containing additional arginine (9 g), vitamin C  (500 mg) and zinc (30 mg). Nutritional status measurements (dietary,  anthropometric and biochemical) and pressure ulcer size and severity (by PUSH  tool; Pressure Ulcer Scale for Healing; 0=completely healed, 17=greatest  severity) were measured weekly for 3 weeks. RESULTS: Patients' age and BMI ranges  were 37-92 years and 16.4-28.1 k g/m2) respectively. Baseline PUSH scores were  similar between groups (8.7+/-0.5). Only patients receiving additional arginine,  vitamin C and zinc demonstrated a clinically significant improvement in pressure  ulcer healing (9.4+/-1.2 vs. 2.6+/-0.6; baseline and week 3, respectively;  P<0.01). All patient groups presented with low serum albumin and zinc and  elevated C-reactive protein. There were no significant changes in biochemical  markers, oral dietary intake or weight in any group. CONCLUSIONS: In this small  set of patients, supplementary arginine, vitamin C and zinc significantly  improved the rate of pressure ulcer healing. The results need to be confirmed in  a larger study.

AB  - Sacral pressure sore treatment requires a multidisciplinary approach, the surgical procedures following nutritional and medical status rehabilitation,  spasticity control and sepsis treatment. Serial surgical debridement might also  precede flap coverage. Gluteal flaps design such as rotation, transposition or  V-Y advancement is selected according to the shape and size of the sore. Our  experience with 74 patients with 95 flaps includes 38 rotation flaps, 28 V-Y and  8 transposition flaps. Twenty one patients had bilateral gluteal V-Y flaps. Only  2 transposition flaps had marginal necrosis that healed per secundam. Delayed  healing occurred in 12 cases due to sepsis, that healed spontaneously in 10 cases  and required surgical reintervention for excision and flap reposition in 2.  Prolonged bed immobilization, postoperative antibiotic therapy and late suture  removal are important factors in surgical success.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In order to reduce protein-energy malnutrition in older people during hospitalisation an early interdisciplinary intervention is needed. We developed a  protocol which includes screening for malnutrition, dysphagia and dehydration on  admission, followed by immediate interventions. OBJECTIVE: To assess  effectiveness of the protocol on nutritional status, hospital-acquired infections  and pressure sores, and to evaluate the protocol s economical feasibility.  DESIGN: Prospective, controlled study. SETTING: The inpatient geriatric service  of a university hospital (UMC Nijmegen) and a geriatric ward of a non-academic  teaching hospital (Rijnstate Hospital, Arnhem). SUBJECTS: 298 older patients (>60  years). METHODS: One of the geriatric wards applied the protocol (N=140) while  the other provided standard care (N=158). All non-terminally ill patients  admitted for more than two days were included. Body mass was measured on  admittance and discharge and hospital-acquired infections and pressure sores were  scored and costs related to nutrition, infections and length of hospital stay  were assessed. RESULTS: There was a 0.8 kg loss (SEM 0.3 kg) in average weight in  the standard care group and a 0.9 kg gain (SEM 0.2 kg) in the intervention group  (p<0.001). The number of hospital acquired infections was significantly lower in  the intervention group (33/140 versus 58/158, p=0.01) but no significant  difference in number of patients with pressure sores (23/140 versus 33/158) was  found. Costs were not significantly different: 7516 versus 7908 Euro/patient for  intervention versus controls, respectively. CONCLUSION: An early  interdisciplinary intervention approach can be effective in reducing  protein-energy malnutrition and related hospital-acquired infections and appears  to be economically feasible.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Malnutrition is a risk factor for development of pressure ulcers (PU). Nutritional supplementation may thus reduce the incidence of PU. We  investigated the effect of nutritional supplementation on incidence of PU in  hip-fracture patients at risk of developing PU. METHODS: Hip-fracture patients  (n=103) were included in this double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial.  They received 400 ml daily of a supplement enriched with protein, arginine, zinc  and antioxidants (n=51) or a non-caloric, water-based placebo supplement (n=52).  Presence and stage of PU were assessed daily for 28 days or until discharge  (median: 10 days during supplementation). RESULTS: Incidence of PU was not  different between supplement (55%) and placebo (59%), but incidence of PU stage  II showed a 9% difference (difference: 0.091; 95% CI: 0.07-0.25) between  supplement (18%) and placebo (28%). Of patients developing PU 57% developed it by  the second day. Time of onset (days) showed a trend (P=0.090) towards later onset  of PU with supplement (3.6+/-0.9) than placebo (1.6+/-0.9). CONCLUSIONS:  Hip-fracture patients develop PU at an early stage. Nutritional supplementation  may not prevent PU at this stage, but contributes possibly to a delayed onset and  progression of PU. Nutritional supplementation may be more effective if initiated  earlier.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate change in pressure ulcer prevalence in long-term nursing home residents since the implementation of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act  of 1987 (OBRA '87). DESIGN: Cross-sectional comparison of two time periods.  SETTING: Ninety-two nursing homes scheduled for a quality-of-care survey randomly  selected from 22 representative states. PARTICIPANTS: Four thousand six hundred  seventy-nine residents who had resided in the facility for at least 100 days were  evaluated: 2,336 during 1992-1994 and 2,343 during 1997-1998. MEASUREMENTS:  Trained registered nurses collected data on pressure ulcer prevalence, stage, and  risk factors from medical record review during on-site evaluations. Risk-adjusted  differences were estimated using logistic regression. RESULTS: Unadjusted  prevalence rates for all stages of pressure ulcers (8.52% vs 8.54%, P =.983) and  those rated stage 2 or greater (5.31% vs 5.63%, P =.624) did not differ between  the two time periods. After adjustment for urinary incontinence, immobility, poor  nutrition, and history of previous pressure ulcers, the relative odds of having a  pressure ulcer in 1992/4 versus 1997/8 was 1.06 (95% confidence interval (CI) =  0.84-1.34) for all stages and 1.21 (95% CI = 0.92-1.60) for stages 2 and greater.  CONCLUSIONS: No change in pressure ulcer prevalence was demonstrated since  implementation of OBRA '87 in this nationally derived sample of long-term nursing  home residents.

T2  - Ostomy/wound management
AB  - "Least costly but most effective" has never been more important to healthcare delivery than in the current healthcare environment of changing reimbursement  systems. In wound care, the high costs associated with renting advanced support  surfaces may be an area where expenses can be decreased if similar outcomes can  be attained by using more affordable mattresses. This article compares the  healing rates and eventual outcomes of wounds among two groups of patients  randomly assigned to one of two support surfaces. A commonly used low-air-loss  mattress was compared with the study mattress, an advanced, non-powered, air and  foam surface. Subjects were patients admitted to either of two long-term  healthcare settings for the treatment of wounds. The resulting two groups of 10  patients each were evenly matched for average age and percentage of patients who  were nutritionally deficient as indicated by albumin or pre-albumin levels. The  presence of gastrointestinal tubes and ventilator dependency also was recorded.  Consistent wound care protocols were used on both groups, including turning  schedules, nutrition, topical medication, and dressings. The study period covered  a maximum of 8 weeks; interest was centered on the rate of wound healing and  progress toward a goal rather than the length of time to completely close a  wound. After 8 weeks, or upon discharge from the study pressure ulcers in the  study mattress group closed at an average rate per week of 9.0% +/- 4.8 versus  5.0% +/- 3.7 in the low-air-loss mattress group. This study indicates that the  study mattress can provide benefits to the wound healing process similar to or  better than low-air-loss mattresses at a substantially reduced cost.

AB  - The clinical value of growth factor treatment of chronic wounds has yet to be determined. Beneficial effects have been reported so far only from specialized  wound care centers where growth factors supplemented the results achieved with  good wound care. In general optimization of current methods of external wound  care, adequate metabolic and nutritional control and surgical measures should be  employed before any adjuvant growth factor therapy is attempted. Current use of  exogenously applied growth factors and cytokines appears to be reasonable only in  the setting of controlled clinical studies according to the rules of "good  clinical practice". With more knowledge on the biology of chronic wounds and  progress in wound pharmacology the best application for these peptides will have  to be reevaluated.

AB  - Nutritional status has been associated with the development and healing of pressure ulcers. This study aimed to examine the dietary intake of adults who had  pressure ulcers (n = 75) and a control group with no pressure ulcers (n = 100),  randomly selected from those receiving treatment from community nurses. All  participants were considered to be at risk of developing pressure damage. Dietary  intake was assessed using a 24-hour recall method (completed by 84 participants)  and a nutritional questionnaire (completed by all 175 participants). The mean age  of participants was 79 +/- 6 years and 70% were women. Patients who had pressure  ulcers had a lower energy intake (mean difference -185 kcal, 95% confidence  interval -413 to 43) and intake of protein (mean difference -6.73 g/day, 95% CI  -16.20 to 2.74) but neither factor achieved a standard level of statistical  significance. However, when protein was categorised into quartiles, a  significantly higher proportion of participants with low intake had pressure  ulcers on chi-squared analysis (p = 0.043). More participants who had pressure  ulcers required assistance with eating (odds ratio 4.55, 95% CI 1.53 to 13.54)  and more had experienced recent taste changes (odds ratio 3.28, 95% CI 1.19 to  9.10). While these differences were significant, there were few major differences  between those who had pressure ulcers and the control group. A number of  participants in both groups had poor nutritional intake and other risk factors  for malnutrition were also found. Poor nutrition is a problem for all patients  receiving community nursing care, not just those with pressure ulceration. Due to  acknowledged difficulties in recording nutritional intake in elderly patients,  further assessment of dietary intake in those receiving community nursing  services should be undertaken to support these results.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of nutritional supplementation on dietary intake and on pressure ulcer development in critically ill older  patients. The multi-center trial involved 19 wards stratified according to  specialty and recruitment for critically ill older patients; 9 wards were  randomly selected for nutritional intervention (nutritional intervention group),  consisting of the daily distribution of two oral supplements, with each  supplement containg 200 kcal, for 15 d. Pressure ulcer incidence was  prospectively recorded for grades I (erythema), II (superficial broken skin), and  III (subcutaneous lesion) for 15 d. Nutritional intake was monitored by using  estimates in units of quarters validated by comparison with weight measurement.  There were 672 subjects older than 65 y, and 295 were in the nutritional  intervention group versus 377 in the control group. The patients were similar for  age, sex ratio, and C-reactive protein. In comparison with the control group, the  nutritional intervention group included more patients with stroke, heart failure,  and dyspnea and fewer with antecedent falls, delirium, lower limb fractures, and  digestive disease. The nutritional intervention group had a lower risk of  pressure ulcers according to the Norton score but was less dependent (Kuntzman  score) and had a lower serum albumin level. During the trial, energy and protein  intakes were higher in the nutritional intervention group (day 2: 1081 +/- 595  kcal versus 957 +/- 530 kcal, P = 0.006; 45.9 +/- 27.8 g protein versus 38.3 +/-  23.8 g protein in the control group, P < 0.001). At 15 d, the cumulative  incidence of pressure ulcers was 40.6% in the nutritional intervention group  versus 47.2% in the control group. The proportion of grade I cases relative to  the total number of cases was 90%. Multivariate analysis, taking into account all  diagnoses, potential risk factors, and the intra-ward correlation, indicated that  the independent risk factors of developing a pressure ulcer during this period  were: serum albumin level at baseline, for 1 g/L decrease: 1.05 (95% confidence  interval: 1.02 to 1.07, P < 0.001); Kuntzmann score at baseline, for 1-point  increase: 1.22 (0.32 to 4.58, P = 0.003); lower limb fracture: 2.68 (1.75 to  4.11, P < 0.001); Norton score < 10 versus > 14: 1.28 (1.01 to 1.62, P = 0.04);  and belonging to the control group: 1.57 (1.03 to 2.38, P = 0.04). In conclusion,  it was possible to increase the dietary intake of critically ill elderly subjects  by systematic use of oral supplements. This intervention was associated with a  decreased risk of pressure ulcer incidence.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We exemplify the use of a marginal approach with proportional hazards model when failure times are correlated. METHODS: The marginal distribution for  each failure time is formulated by the Cox proportional hazards model, while the  dependence structure is unspecified. However, a correct variance-covariance  estimate of the regression coefficients that takes into account the intra-group  correlation is proposed. The program MULCOX2 which implements this statistical  methodology is used to assess the effect of a nutritional supplementation  intervention on pressure ulcer development on critically ill older patients from  a multicentric trial (involving 19 wards). We compare the results obtained with  those of the usual Cox regression. RESULTS: The naive approach yields much  smaller standard error estimates of the regression parameters than the robust  approach. CONCLUSION: In our example, the results obtained with the marginal  approach do not modify the conclusions: a nutritional supplementation  intervention tends to decrease significantly the formation of pressure ulcers.  However in other situations, ignoring the intra-cluster dependence could lead to  invalid statistical inference. The variability of the estimated effects by  MULCOX2 can be quite sensitive to the number of clusters in the sample and to the  clusters size.

AB  - Bedsores prevention is part of the specific role of the nurse, as defined namely in the order 84-869 of the 17. July 1984. The analysis of the risk factors for  the appearance of bedsores shows that immobilization, reduction of mobility  linked to vigilance disorders and the urinary and faecal incontinence are major  elements which justify protocols of well defined local cares. More recently, the  role of undernutrition was highlighted but the recommendations lack accuracy. The  proteino-energizing undernutrition is frequent among the elderly patients in  hospital, reaching 60% of all the patients in the department of acute affections.  The association of a constituted bedsore and of clinical and/or biological scars  of protein-energizing undernutrition is demonstrated and justifies a re-feeding  of the patients suffering from bedsores. On the other hand, although a bad  nutrition state seems to favour the appearance of a bedsore, it is not proved  that the nutrition intensification associating the diagnosis of an  under-nutrition and the starting of an adapted re-feeding (with enriched food or  assistance) decreases the actual incidence of the bedsores. A prospective,  multicentered, randomized survey was therefore proposed. Its aim was to study the  Influence of Nutrition in the Bedsores Prevention among the Elderly Patients in  hospitals, suffering from acute affections. This research follows upon the  preventions audits of bedsores and the nutrition protocol started up in a  department of geriatrics intern medicine in the Regional Center of Geriatrics of  Bordeaux. CONCLUSION: Two results must be retained in this nursing survey. It  gave the possibility of calling into question the professional experience of the  nursing teams which participated to the research and to update their knowledge in  the field of the bedsores prevention. They could thus be acquainted with the  existence of the grids which evaluate the risk of bedsore, the dependence or even  the nutrition supply and to assess the interest for improving the cares quality.  On the other hand, we highlighted the possibility of increasing the energy and  protein supply by a distribution of enriched food supplements. Moreover, this  action has had a beneficial influence in the bedsores prevention among the old  people.

AB  - Pressure sores are a frequent problem, especially in elderly patients. Nutritional status may influence the incidence, progression and severity of  pressure sores, data, however, are contradictory (1). The purpose of this study  was to determine the effect of supplemental feeding on the nutritional status and  the development and severity of pressure sores. The effect of supplemental  feeding overnight (tube +) on patients with a fracture of the hip and a high  pressure-sore risk score, was studied in a randomized clinical trial. The control  group (tube -) had no supplemental feeding. After informed consent, 140 patients  were randomized, and 129 of these took part in the trial (62 tube +, and 67 tube  -). Protein and energy intake, haemoglobin, serum albumin, total serum protein  and pressure-sore grade were measured at admission and after 1 and 2 weeks. Of  the 62 patients randomized for tube feeding (tube +), only 25 tolerated their  tube for more than 1 week and 16 for 2 weeks. Nevertheless, energy and protein  intake was significantly higher in the tube + group (P < 0.001). This, however,  did not significantly influence total serum protein, serum albumin and  development and severity of pressure sores after 1 and 2 weeks. Comparison of the  actually tube fed group (n=25 at 1 week, n = 16 at 2 weeks) and the control group  showed a 2-3 times higher protein and energy intake (P < 0.0001), and a  significantly higher total serum protein and serum albumin after 1 and 2 weeks in  the actually tube fed group (all P < 0.001). Pressure-sore development and  severity were not significantly influenced in the actually tube fed group. We  conclude that we were not able to show a significant decrease in development and  severity of pressure sores, because the nasogastric tube for supplemental feeding  was not well tolerated in this patient group. Nevertheless, tube feeding  overnight does result in a significant higher protein and energy intake, and has  a significant effect on nutritional status in the actually tube-fed group. Other  means of supplemental feeding will have to be used in order to answer the  question of whether supplemental feeding can decrease development and severity of  pressure sores.

AB  - A randomized prospective study was done to evaluate the two treatments for pressure sores infected with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in  elderly patients: Gentian violet plus dibutyryl cAMP (GVcAMP, n = 8) and  povidone-iodine plus sugar (IS, n = 11). Age, underlying diseases, and  nutritional status did not differ between the two groups. Specimens were obtained  biweekly from the pressure sores and were cultured. The percentage of culture  dishes with no methicillin-resistant S. aureus was 93% for the patients given  GVcAMP, but only 74% for those given IS (p < 0.01). By the 14th week after the  start of treatment, the mean area of the pressure sores in the GVcAMP group had  decreased to 45% of the area at the start of treatment. In the IS group, the  decrease was smaller to 56% of the area before treatment. No local or systemic  adverse effects occurred in either group. GVcAMP is useful to treat pressure  sores infected with methicillin-resistant S. aureus.

TI  - The usefulness of topical application of essential fatty acids (EFA) to prevent pressure ulcers.
AU  - Declair, V.
T2  - Ostomy/wound management
AB  - This study investigated whether the topical application of essential fatty acids improves hydration and elasticity and helps prevent skin breakdown in individuals  with poor nutritional status. Between June 1995 and July 1996, 86 patients,  equally divided into two groups, underwent double-blind research (mean age = 60;  range 26-78). All patients had a Norton Scale score of 9 and were fed orally a  high-protein diet and/or received parenteral nutrition (92% were severely  malnourished). Pressure ulcer prevention was the same for both groups. Every 8  hours, approximately 20 ml of solution A (1.6 gr EFA with linoleic acid extracted  from sunflower oil, 112 UI vitamin A, and 5 UI Vitamin E) or B (1.6 gr mineral  oil, 112 UI Vitamin A, and 5 UI Vitamin E) was applied all over the body  inclusive of all potential wound sites for a mean of 21 days. In group A, two  patients developed ulcers (both Stage I, one per patient); 42 (98%) had hydrated  skin and 32 (76%) maintained skin elasticity. In group B, 12 (27%) developed  ulcers (all Stage II, ten with 1 ulcer, two with 2 ulcers); 9 (22%) had hydrated  skin while 34 (78%) showed scaly skin/deep dehydration; 10 (24%) maintained skin  elasticity while 33 (76%) showed a loss of elasticity. These results lead us to  believe that essential fatty acids really do make a difference in the skin.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical effectiveness and wound management properties of a copolymer membrane, Inerpan (Synthélabo), and a hydrocolloid dressing,  Comfeel (Coloplast), in the treatment of decubitus ulcers in the elderly. DESIGN:  Open, randomized, multicentric French study, with two parallel groups of  patients. PATIENTS: 168 in-patients aged more 65 years (mean age: 82 years)  suffering from grade II to grade IV (in the Shea classification) pressure sores.  TRIAL PERIOD: Either 8 weeks or until the ulcer healed, whichever occurred first.  MEASUREMENTS: In addition to a complete physical examination, patients were  evaluated at baseline for nutritional status and risk factors. The wounds were  described, their depth scored, and the areas traced at Weeks 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and  8. The number of dressings used was recorded. RESULTS: Thirty-one Inerpan-treated  patients and 23 Comfeel-treated patients achieved healing (P = 0.089), with  respective median healing times of 32 and 38 days. Healing times were compared  using survival curves (in the whole population) adjusted for ulcer depth effect  and showed a significant difference in favor of Inerpan (P = 0.044 and 0.014).  Progress of healing (percentage of ulcer healed) was calculated in the two  groups. Clinically assessed the treatment performance scored at the completion of  the study showed better results with Inerpan (P < 0.05). Both groups were similar  in terms of granulation/exudation scores, surrounding skin, and ease of care.  CONCLUSION: It is concluded that Inerpan is easy to use, safeguards the healing  process, and is of particular value in the management of pressure sores.

AU  - Warner, D. J.
T2  - Decubitus
AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of pressure ulcers treated on a low-air loss bed and a foam mattress with loose-fitting top cover.  The two-group, non-randomized study design consisted of a convenience sample of  20 subjects: 10 subjects treated on the low-air loss bed and 10 subjects treated  on the foam mattress with loose-fitting top cover. Subjects were selected from  among patients located in the medical/surgical, critical care, and the skilled  nursing units of a metropolitan public teaching hospital. Descriptive data,  laboratory data, pressure ulcer transparency drawing, and pressure ulcer  photographs were obtained on each subject every seven days from two to four  weeks. A one-way analysis of variance indicated that there was no statistically  significant difference in the pressure ulcer outcomes of subjects treated on the  low-air loss bed (Mediscus) compared to the pressure ulcer outcomes of subjects  treated on the foam mattress with loose-fitting top cover (Comfortex). Analysis  of covariance further indicated no statistically significant difference in the  pressure ulcer outcome of subjects treated on either pressure-relieving surface  according to the subjects': a) age, percent ideal body weight, presence of  pressure ulcer infection; b) leukocyte count, total lymphocyte count, and albumin  level; and c) level of sensory perception, moisture, activity, mobility,  nutrition, friction, and shear. Results from this study indicate that the low-air  loss bed and foam mattress with loose-fitting top cover provide comparable  pressure ulcer outcomes. Implications for nursing and recommendations for further  study are included in the text.

T2  - Journal of the American Geriatrics Society
AB  - The terminal phase of dementia is initiated by the inability to swallow. New techniques of enteral alimentation permit more effective, longer intubation. To  assess the application of these new techniques to late-stage demented aged  patients, all current intubations in a teaching nursing home were reviewed. Of 52  feeding intubations, 26 had been in situ for more than 1 year. A randomly  selected comparison group of nonintubated patients was also studied. Weight  increased for 48% of the intubated group versus 17% of the nonintubated group (P  less than .01). Aspiration pneumonia occurred more often in the intubated group  (58%) than in the nonintubated group (17%) (P less than .01). Decubitus ulcers  were also more common in the intubated group (21%) than in the nonintubated group  (14%). Restraints were used more in the intubated group (71%) than in the  nonintubated group (56%). These differences did not reach statistical  significance. All of the intubated patients were severely demented, with MMSE  scores of zero. Seventy-one percent of the nonintubated group were demented, with  MMSE scores of less than 23. Prolongation of the terminal phase of dementia in  the aged by tube feeding is now feasible. The implications of this change in the  life-span of demented nursing home patients need attention by families, nursing  homes, and those who make public health policy.

AB  - A preliminary study was conducted on 80 patients with all stages of pressure ulcers to ascertain the seven-day effect on healing of four treatments: 1)  consistent wound care, 2) carefully controlled nutritional support, 3) both  consistent wound care and carefully controlled nutritional support, and 4)  standard hospital treatment. Formal analysis confirmed that differences observed  in the sample characteristics of treatment groups did not influence outcomes.  There were no group differences in healing as shown by three indicators: 1)  improvement in the ulcer stage, 2) decrease in ulcer size, and 3) a dichotomous  clinical rating of improvement. In all groups a normal transferrin was correlated  with improvement in stage and size of ulcers. This suggests a nutritional role in  wound healing.

AB  - We prospectively followed inpatients receiving treatment for pressure sores to identify the better of two local treatment regimens. Twenty-seven patients with  76 pressure sores received treatment with hydrocolloid dressings (HCDs) and 25  patients with 52 pressure sores received treatment with Dakin's solution  (chloramine-T)-soaked wet-to-dry dressings. Thirty-eight (73%) patients initially  had severe nutritional depletion. The mean serum albumin value of the pressure  sore treatment groups was lower than that of an age-matched group without  pressure sores. In the HCD group, 66 (86.8%) pressure sores improved compared  with 36 (69.2%) pressure sores in the wet-to-dry dressings group. The HCD regimen  was more efficacious even in a subgroup of patients who received inadequate  nutritional support during treatment. Adequate nutritional intake during the  study was associated with better healing in both local treatment groups.

AB  - Early pressure areas in 38 cases (33 patients) were randomly treated twice daily with topical applications of either mucopolysaccharide polysulphate (MPS) or the  cream base. The patients were assessed weekly for 4 weeks, the main parameter  being change in the area of the pressure area. In the MPS group a significant  reduction in size was obtained during the 2nd week of treatment, while in the  control group a significant reduction was not obtained until week 4. At the end  of the treatment, 59% (10/17) of the MPS group were fully healed compared with  21% (4/19) of the control group, the difference being statistically significant,  p less than 0.05. MPS resembles heparin chemically, and the results could be  attributed to an improvement in the microcirculation and nutrition of the  perivascular tissue through an inhibition of microthrombi and perivascular fibrin  deposition.

AB  - In a prospective double-blind controlled trial the effect of large doses of ascorbic acid on the healing of pressure-sores has been assessed. 20 surgical  patients were studied, the pressure areas being assessed by serial photography  and ulcer tracings. The mean ascorbic-acid levels in treated and non-treated  groups one month after the start of treatment were 65.6 and 25.8 mug per 10-8  white blood-cells. In the group treated with ascorbic acid there was a mean  reduction in pressure-sore area of 84% after one month compared with 42.7% in the  placebo group. These findings are statistically significant (P less than 0.005)  and suggest that ascorbic acid may accelerate the healing of pressure-sores.

AB  - 59 elderly patients (mean age 82) with femoral neck fractures were randomised into two groups. 27 patients received daily an oral nutrition supplement (250 ml,  20 g protein, 254 kcal) for a mean of 32 days; 32 patients acted as controls. On  admission most patients had nutritional deficiencies. Despite being offered  adequate quantities, nutritional requirements were not met during the hospital  stay. Clinical outcome was significantly better in the supplemented group (56%  favourable course vs 13% in controls) during the stay in the convalescent  hospital. The rates of complications and deaths were also significantly lower in  supplemented patients (44% vs 87%). 6 months after the fracture the rates of  complications and mortality were significantly lower in supplemented patients  (40% vs 74%). The median duration of hospital stay was significantly shorter in  the supplemented group (24 vs 40 days). Thus the clinical outcome of elderly  patients with femoral neck fracture can be improved by once daily dietary oral  supplementation.

AB  - The present study was designed to evaluate to the effect of dietary supplements on clinical outcome and nutritional status in a large group of geriatric patients  (n = 501). The patients were randomised into an experimental group which received  nutritional supplementation (400 kcal) as well as a standard hospital diet, and a  control group on hospital diet alone. The nutritional state was measured on  admission and after 8 and 26 weeks by anthropometry, serum protein analysis and a  delayed hypersensitivity skin test. Protein energy malnutrition was defined as  the presence of three or more abnormal parameters. 28.5% of patients showed  evidence of malnutrition on admission. Hospitalisation itself resulted in a  gradual deterioration in nutritional status. Nutritional supplementation  generally improved nutritional state. Among those patients who were well  nourished on admission, and subsequently receiving dietary supplementation, 8.3%  fulfilled malnutrition criteria after 26 weeks, while 21.1% were considered  malnourished in the control group (p < 0.05). The improvement observed in  transport proteins was probably related to nutritional support and not just to  the reversal of inflammation. In the initially well nourished group of more than  300 patients, the mortality rate was 8.6% in those given nutritional support  compared to 18.6% in the control group (p < 0.02).

AB  - The aims of the study were to investigate the relationship between nutritional state and the development of pressure sores and to test the hypothesis that  supplementary nutritional support might prevent pressure sore development and  improve healing. Newly admitted long-term care patients hospitalised for more  than 3 weeks were included and randomised into an experimental and a control  group. The nutritional state was evaluated using serum protein analyses,  anthropometry and the delayed hypersensitivity skin test. Further, the patients'  condition was assessed weekly using a modified Norton scale. The experimental  group received extra nutritional support. Significantly more patients with  protein-energy malnutrition had, or developed, pressure sores. Regression  analyses indicated albumin, mobility, activity and food intake as predictors for  pressure sores. Patients who received extra nutritional support tended to develop  fewer pressure sores and to heal existing pressure sores to a greater extent than  the control group, although this did not reach statistical significance.

AB  - The objective of this study was to assess the effects of ascorbic acid supplementation, 500 mg twice daily in the treatment of pressure ulcers as an  adjunct to standardized treatment. The design consisted of a multicenter blinded  randomized trial. The control group received 10 mg of ascorbic acid twice daily.  Patients from 11 nursing homes and 1 hospital participated. Main outcome measures  included wound survival, healing rates of wound surfaces, and clinimetric changes  over 12 weeks. Eighty-eight patients were randomized. Intention-to-treat analysis  showed that the wound closure probability per unit time (i.e., the closure rate)  was not higher in the intervention group than in the control group (Cox hazard  ratio of 0.78 [90% precision interval, 0.44-1.39]). Mean absolute healing rates  were 0.21 and 0.27 cm2/week in the intervention and control group, respectively  (PI of the adjusted difference: -0.17 to 0.13). Relative healing rates and  healing velocities did not show favorable results of ascorbic acid  supplementation, either. A panel scored slides of the ulcers with a report mark  between 1 (bad) and 10 (excellent). The improvement was 0.45 and 0.72 points per  week in the intervention and control group, respectively (PI of the adjusted  difference: -0.50 to 0.20). With another clinimetric index we could not show any  differences, either. These data do not support the idea that ascorbic acid  supplementation (500 vs. 10 mg twice daily) speeds up the healing of pressure  ulcers.

AB  - Physiologic responses of 30 enterally-fed long-term care residents with type 2 diabetes receiving total nutrition support via either a disease-specific  (reduced-carbohydrate, modified-fat) formula or a standard high-carbohydrate  formula for 3 mo were compared. Objectives of the study included evaluating  metabolic response (glycemic control and lipids) and clinical outcomes.  Thirty-four subjects requiring total enteral nutrition support by tube were  enrolled in this prospectively randomized, double-blind, controlled, parallel  group 3-mo pilot trial. Thirty were evaluable in that they completed 4 wk.  Twenty-seven completed all 12 wk. The groups were well-matched for physiologic  and demographic parameters at baseline. Fasting serum glucose and capillary  (fingerstick) glucose values demonstrated better control in the disease-specific  formula-fed group. Serum lipid profiles of this group were similar to or better  than those of the standard formula-fed group. The amount of insulin administered  to insulin-using subjects in the disease-specific formula-fed group was  consistently less than before initiation of the formula, whereas the amount  administered was consistently higher in the group fed the standard formula.  Overall, subjects randomized to the disease-specific formula experienced better  numerical biochemical control and better clinical outcomes when expressed on a  numerical and percentage basis. These included surrogate markers of diabetes  control such as serum glucose and glycohemoglobin, as well as clinical outcomes  such as incidence of infections and pressure ulcers. These findings confirm that  the disease-specific formula provides better glycemic control, poses no risk to  lipoprotein metabolism, and provides for better clinical outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Undernutrition is common in hospital patients with stroke, can develop or worsen in hospital, and is associated with poor outcomes. We aimed to  establish whether routine oral nutritional supplements improve outcome after  stroke. METHODS: The FOOD trials are a family of three pragmatic, multicentre,  randomised controlled trials. We measured the outcomes of stroke patients who  could swallow and who were randomly allocated normal hospital diet or normal  hospital diet plus oral nutritional supplements until hospital discharge. The  primary outcome was death or poor outcome (modified Rankin scale [MRS] grade  3-5), 6 months after enrollment, measured unaware of treatment allocation.  Analysis was by intention to treat. FINDINGS: Between Nov 1, 1996, and July 31,  2003, 4023 patients were enrolled by 125 hospitals in 15 countries. Only 314 (8%)  patients were judged to be undernourished at baseline. Vital status and MRS at  the end of the trial were known for 4012 and 4004 patients, respectively.  Supplemented diet was associated with an absolute reduction in risk of death of  0.7% (95% CI -1.4 to 2.7) and an increased risk of death or poor outcome of 0.7%  (-2.3 to 3.8). INTERPRETATION: We could not confirm the anticipated 4% absolute  benefit for death or poor outcome from routine oral nutritional supplements for  mainly well nourished stroke patients in hospital. Our results would be  compatible with a 1% or 2% absolute benefit or harm from oral supplements. These  results do not support a policy of routine oral supplementation after stroke.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare Pressure Ulcer Scale for Healing (PUSH) scores at 8 weeks in long-term-care residents with pressure ulcers who were given standard care  plus a concentrated, fortified, collagen protein hydrolysate supplement vs.  residents who were given standard care plus placebo. DESIGN: Randomized,  prospective, controlled, multicenter trial at 23 long-term-care facilities in 4  states. SUBJECTS: A total of 89 residents with Stage II, III, or IV pressure  ulcers were entered into the trial; 71 residents completed the study.  INTERVENTION: Residents were randomized to receive standard care plus a  concentrated, fortified, collagen protein hydrolysate supplement (n = 56) or  standard care plus placebo (n = 33) 3 times daily for 8 weeks. Wound healing was  assessed biweekly using the PUSH tool, version 3.0. This tool categorizes  pressure ulcers by surface area, exudate, and type of wound tissue. PRIMARY  OUTCOME MEASURE: Change in PUSH tool scores in each group at 8 weeks. RESULTS:  After 8 weeks of treatment, residents who received standard care plus the  concentrated, fortified, collagen protein hydrolysate supplement had  significantly better PUSH tool scores compared with those who received standard  care plus placebo (3.55 +/- 4.66 vs 3.22 +/- 4.11, respectively; P < .05).  CONCLUSION: By week 8, PUSH tool scores-a measurement of pressure ulcer  healing-showed approximately twice the rate of pressure ulcer healing in the  treatment group compared with the control group. A concentrated, fortified,  collagen protein hydrolysate supplement may be of benefit to residents of  long-term-care facilities who have pressure ulcers.

AB  - AIMS: To investigate whether a nutritional intervention in older women and men with femoral neck fracture had an effect on postoperative complications during  hospitalization and on nutritional status at a four-month follow-up. METHODS: The  design was a randomized controlled trial. The present study sample consisted of  157 patients aged 70 years and above with femoral neck fracture. The nutritional  intervention included, among other things, a nutritional journal to detect  nutrition deficiencies and protein-enriched meals for at least four days  postoperatively. Further, at least two nutritional and protein drinks were served  each day during the whole hospitalization and other factors that would influence  the patient's nutrition were also considered and dealt with. Postoperative  complications were registered and patients were assessed using the Mini  Nutritional Assessment (MNA) scale, including body mass index (BMI), on admission  and at a four-month follow-up. RESULTS: Malnutrition was common and low MNA  scores were associated with postoperative complications such as delirium and  decubitus ulcers. There were significantly fewer days of delirium in the  intervention group, seven patients in the intervention group developed decubitus  ulcers vs. 14 patients in the control group and the total length of  hospitalization was shorter. There were no detectable significant improvements  regarding nutritional parameters between the intervention and the control group  at the four-month follow-up but men improved their mean BMI, body weight and MNA  scores in both the intervention and the control groups while women deteriorated  in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Malnutrition was common among older people with hip  fractures admitted to hospital. The nutritional intervention might have  contributed to the patients suffering fewer days with delirium, fewer decubitus  ulcers and shorter hospitalization but did not improve the long-term nutritional  status, at least not in women. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This nutritional  intervention, which was included in a multifactorial multidisciplinary  intervention, is inexpensive and relatively easy to implement. It has significant  effects on complications but no long-term effect on nutritional parameters, at  least not in women.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of hyponutrition in hospitalized patients in our setting is 53%. The therapeutic approach is controversial. OBJECTIVES: To  determine whether an early nutritional intervention in hospitalized patients by  means of oral nutritional support can improve their prognosis regarding decreased  morbimortality and hospital stay. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Randomized prospective  study comprised by a treatment group and a control group of malnourished patients  hospitalized at the Internal Medicine and Respiratory Medicine Departments. The  nutritional diagnosis was made by using the Subjective Global Assessment. Groups  B and C were assigned to receive the hospital diet according to their needs and  pathology (control group) and the treatment group also received a standard  nutritional supplement. We recorded the development of infections, pressure  ulcers, hospitalization days, mortality, and weight. RESULTS: We performed more  than 1,700 Subjective Global Assessments. Five hundred and thirty seven patients  (264 treated and 273 controls) were followed-up until hospital discharge or  death. We did not find statistically significant differences in mortality,  hospital stay, or occurrence of complications between the treatment group and the  control group. The treatment group presented statistically significant weight  increase as compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS: We could not  demonstrate benefits when using the oral nutritional supplement in terms of  mortality, hospital stay, infectious complications, or pressure ulcers. The  significant weight increase in the treatment group allowed us concluding that the  supplement effectively treated hyponutrition in this group. This new clinical  status implies a better prognosis, as it has already been shown. However, this  could not be observed by means of the study parameters. Long-term studies are  required to determine for how long this nutritional improvement can be sustained,  implying a better prognosis in the long run.
