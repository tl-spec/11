AB  - BACKGROUND: Socially assistive robots introduced in nursing care settings have multidimensional psychological impacts on care recipients and caregivers. This  study aims to explore the longitudinal changes induced by socially assistive  robots, focusing on a chain of human behaviors. METHODS: In this qualitative  study, nine participants from two nursing homes who had experience in  manipulating socially assistive robots were interviewed in a semi-structured  focus group using a topic guide to explore the changes in care recipients and  caregivers. Following the framework analysis method, the transcripts were coded  using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health  (ICF). The identified codes were charted for each side-care recipients and  caregivers sides- using a causal loop diagram, a tool used to visualize nonlinear  dynamics in complex systems. RESULTS: Three and seven kinds of codes in the  domains of "body functions" and "activities and participation", respectively,  were identified on the care recipients' side; whereas on the caregivers' side,  one and five kinds of codes in the domains of "body functions" and "activities  and participation", respectively, were found. The codes obtained from the  facility with longer experience were represented graphically as a reinforcing  feedback loop, in which favorable changes were amplified in a chain of events.  Robot use directly changed the mental functions of care recipients, and the  caregivers' perceptions of these positive changes led to their own emotional and  behavioral changes, which would reduce the burden of care. Moreover, the findings  suggest that sharing information regarding these changes and objectively  recognizing the effectiveness of robots among staff members can be the key to  continuous robot use in nursing care settings. Conversely, the figure obtained  from the novice facility shows fragmented chain relationships of the codes,  indicating that all the effects of robot use are recognizable and form a chain  reaction after continuous robot use for more than several months. CONCLUSIONS:  This study revealed important aspects regarding the longitudinal effects of  socially assistive robots in nursing care settings. These implications should be  broadly implemented for effective robot use and reduction of the burden of care  in nursing care settings. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Caregiver burden significantly affects both patients and caregivers but is often overlooked in clinical practice. Physical and emotional strain on  caregivers can compromise the quality of care. Care robots are emerging as  solutions to alleviate these burdens by assisting with routine tasks, thereby  reducing caregivers' physical strain and stress. Therefore, a prospective,  non-randomized, interventional clinical trial was designed to identify changes in  caregivers' physical activities due to care robot use and explore the associated  benefits. METHODS: Twenty-two caregivers (1 male and 21 female; mean age, 62.05  years) were participated. We analyzed the impact of care robots on reducing  physical burden and assessed caregivers' satisfaction with these robots by  examining care activity history, pain levels, muscle activities, and data for  each physical care activity (e.g., transfer, reposition, feeding, and toileting),  categorizing them based on whether a care robot was used. Care robots that assist  in transfer, repositioning, feeding, and toileting activities were used in a  clinical trial. Muscle activity was measured during maximum voluntary isometric  contraction using electromyography sensors placed on the upper trapezius, biceps  brachii, and erector spinae muscles. RESULTS: During care robot use, we observed  a statistically significant decrease in the distance and number of steps required  for assisting with repositioning. However, the caregiving activity time increased  when the robots assisted with transfer, feeding, and toileting (P < .001). Pain  was significantly reduced during transfer and toileting activities using the care  robot (P < .001) as well as during feeding activity (P = .040). Maximum voluntary  isometric contraction showed a significant reduction in the upper trapezius,  biceps brachii, and erector spinae muscles during the 4 care activities when  using the robot, and these findings were consistent across the 3 sessions  (P < .001). In the survey, caregivers indicated that "transfer-assisting" care  robots were the most needed (15 respondents, 68.2%). CONCLUSION: In this study,  we demonstrated that employing care robots can aid in mitigating muscle overuse  among caregivers, potentially alleviating pain due to musculoskeletal conditions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sub-Saharan Africa faces high neonatal and maternal mortality rates due to limited access to skilled healthcare during delivery. This study aims to  improve the classification of health facilities and home deliveries using  advanced machine learning techniques and to explore factors influencing women's  choices of delivery locations in East Africa. METHOD: The study focused on 86,009  childbearing women in East Africa. A comparative analysis of 12 advanced machine  learning algorithms was conducted, utilizing various data balancing techniques  and hyperparameter optimization methods to enhance model performance. RESULT: The  prevalence of health facility delivery in East Africa was found to be 83.71%. The  findings showed that the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm and CatBoost  performed best in predicting the place of delivery, in which both of those  algorithms scored an accuracy of 95% and an AUC of 0.98 after optimized with  Bayesian optimization tuning and insignificant difference between them in all  comprehensive analysis of metrics performance. Factors associated with  facility-based deliveries were identified using association rule mining,  including parental education levels, timing of initial antenatal care (ANC)  check-ups, wealth status, marital status, mobile phone ownership, religious  affiliation, media accessibility, and birth order. CONCLUSION: This study  underscores the vital role of machine learning algorithms in predicting health  facility deliveries. A slight decline in facility deliveries from previous  reports highlights the urgent need for targeted interventions to meet Sustainable  Development Goals (SDGs), particularly in maternal health. The study recommends  promoting facility-based deliveries. These include raising awareness about  skilled birth attendance, encouraging early ANC check-up, addressing financial  barriers through targeted support programs, implementing culturally sensitive  interventions, utilizing media campaigns, and mobile health initiatives. Design  specific interventions tailored to the birth order of the child, recognizing that  mothers may have different informational needs depending on whether it is their  first or subsequent delivery. Furthermore, we recommended researchers to explore  a variety of techniques and validate findings using more recent data.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aims to improve the ethical use of machine learning (ML)-based clinical prediction models (CPMs) in shared decision-making for  patients with kidney failure on dialysis. We explore factors that inform  acceptability, interpretability, and implementation of ML-based CPMs among  multiple constituent groups. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected and analyzed  qualitative data from focus groups with varied end users, including: dialysis  support providers (clinical providers and additional dialysis support providers  such as dialysis clinic staff and social workers); patients; patients' caregivers  (n = 52). RESULTS: Participants were broadly accepting of ML-based CPMs, but with  concerns on data sources, factors included in the model, and accuracy. Use was  desired in conjunction with providers' views and explanations. Differences among  respondent types were minimal overall but most prevalent in discussions of CPM  presentation and model use. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Evidence of acceptability  of ML-based CPM usage provides support for ethical use, but numerous specific  considerations in acceptability, model construction, and model use for shared  clinical decision-making must be considered. There are specific steps that could  be taken by data scientists and health systems to engender use that is accepted  by end users and facilitates trust, but there are also ongoing barriers or  challenges in addressing desires for use. This study contributes to emerging  literature on interpretability, mechanisms for sharing complexities, including  uncertainty regarding the model results, and implications for decision-making. It  examines numerous stakeholder groups including providers, patients, and  caregivers to provide specific considerations that can influence health system  use and provide a basis for future research.

AB  - The implementation of home-care robots is sometimes unsuccessful. This study aimed to explore factors explaining people's willingness to use home-care robots,  particularly among care recipients and caregivers. Surveys were conducted in  Japan, Ireland, and Finland. The survey questionnaire comprised four categories  (familiarity with robots, important points about home-care robots, functions  expected from home-care robots, and ethically acceptable uses), with 48 items  assessing users' willingness to use home-care robots. The responses from 525  Japanese, 163 Irish, and 170 Finnish respondents were analyzed to identify common  and distinct factors influencing their willingness to use these robots. Common  factors across the countries included "willingness to participate in research and  development," "interest in robot-related news," and "having a positive impression  of robots". The distinct factors for each country were: "convenience" in Japan;  "notifying family members and support personnel when an unexpected change occurs  in an older person" in Ireland; and "design" in Finland. Therefore, developers  should determine potential users' willingness to participate in the research and  development of home-care robots and consider a system that involves them in the  development process.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The number of older people with unmet health care and support needs is increasing substantially due to the challenges facing health care systems  worldwide. There are potentially great benefits to using the Internet of Things  coupled with artificial intelligence to support independent living and the  measurement of health risks, thus improving quality of life for the older adult  population. Taking a co-design approach has the potential to ensure that these  technological solutions are developed to address specific user needs and  requirements. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate stakeholders'  perceptions of independent living and technology solutions, identify  stakeholders' suggestions on how technology could assist older adults to live  independently, and explore the acceptability and usefulness of a prototype  Internet of Things solution called the NEX system to support independent living  for an older adult population. METHODS: The development of the NEX system was  carried out in 3 key phases with a strong focus on diverse stakeholder  involvement. The initial predesign exploratory phase recruited 17 stakeholders,  including older adults and family caregivers, using fictitious personas and  scenarios to explore initial perceptions of independent living and technology  solutions. The subsequent co-design and testing phase expanded this to include a  comprehensive web-based survey completed by 380 stakeholders, encompassing older  adults, family caregivers, health care professionals, and home care support  staff. This phase also included prototype testing at home by 7 older adults to  assess technology needs, requirements, and the initial acceptability of the  system. Finally, in the postdesign phase, workshops were held between academic  and industry partners to analyze data collected from the earlier stages and to  discuss recommendations for the future development of the system. RESULTS: The  predesign phase revealed 3 broad themes: loneliness and technology, aging and  technology, and adopting and using technology. The co-design phase highlighted  key areas where technology could assist older adults to live independently: home  security, falls and loneliness, remote monitoring by family members, and  communication with clients. Prototype testing revealed that the acceptability  aspects of the prototype varied across technology types. Ambient sensors and  voice-activated assistants were described as the most acceptable technology by  participants. Last, the postdesign analysis process highlighted that ambient  sensors have the potential for automatic detection of activities of daily living,  resulting in key recommendations for future developments and deployments in this  area. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the significance of incorporating  diverse stakeholder perspectives in developing solutions that support independent  living. Additionally, it emphasizes the advantages of prototype testing in home  environments, offering crucial insights into the real-world experiences of users  interacting with technological solutions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Quality caregiver-infant interaction is crucial for infant growth, health, and development. Traditional methods for evaluating the quality of  caregiver-infant interaction have predominantly relied on rating scales or  observational techniques. However, rating scales are prone to inaccuracies, while  observational techniques are resource-intensive. The utilization of easily  collected medical records in conjunction with machine learning techniques offers  a promising and viable strategy for accurate and efficient assessment of  caregiver-infant interaction quality. METHODS: This study was conducted at a  follow-up outpatient clinic at two tertiary maternal and infant health centers  located in Shanghai, China. 68 caregivers and their 3-15-month-old infants were  videotaped for 3-5 min during playing interactions in non-threatening  environment. Two trained experts utilized the Infant CARE-Index (ICI) procedure  to assess whether the caregivers were sensitive or not in a dyadic context. This  served as the gold standard. Predictors were collected through Health Information  Systems (HIS) and questionnaires, which included accessible features such as  demographic information, parental coping ability, infant neuropsychological  development, maternal depression, parent-infant interaction, and infant  temperament. Four classification models with fivefold cross-validation and grid  search hyperparameter tuning techniques were employed to yield prediction  metrics. Interpretable analyses were conducted to explain the results. RESULTS:  The score of sensitive caregiver-infant interaction was 6.34 ± 2.62. The Random  Forest model gave the best accuracy (83.85%±6.93%). Convergent findings  identified infant age, care skills of infants, mother age, infant  temperament-regulatory capacity, birth weight, positive coping,  health-care-knowledge-of-infants, type of caregiver, MABIS-bonding issues,  ASQ-Fine Motor as the strongest predictors of interaction sensitivity between  infants and their caregiver. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method presents a  promising and efficient approach that synergistically combines rating scales and  artificial technology to detect important features of caregiver-infant  interactions. This novel approach holds several implications for the development  of automatic computational assessment tools in the field of nursing studies.

T2  - Current opinion in supportive and palliative care
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The review aims to synthesize the most recent innovative models of palliative care being delivered in rural and remote locations. RECENT  FINDINGS: Worldwide, as the ageing population grows, more people will require  palliative care. However, equal availability of high-quality palliative care  services remains a significant challenge, particularly in rural and remote  communities. Innovative models of palliative care have been developed to address  the projected need of people in rural and remote areas. Models that leverage the  use of digital healthcare (such as telecare and Artificial Intelligence), the  non-specialized palliative care workforce (such as GPs, pharmacists, and family  carers), and community driven approaches have demonstrated success in achieving  positive palliative care outcomes, such as reduced physical and emotional  distress, and family carers feeling more supported. SUMMARY: There is a need to  support people to remain within their rural and remote communities towards the  end-of-life (EOL). While some models of care have been identified to help with  this, there continues to be significant difficulties in access to health and  social care in rural and remote areas. It is important we build on this research  to understand more broadly the models of support for those living in remote and  rural communities at the EOL.

AB  - Informal caregivers (ICs), including the patient's spouse, close relatives, or friends, play an important role in caregiving individuals with head and neck  cancer (HNC). AI-based chatbots might offer information and assistance related to  caregiving. This study presents the viewpoints of ICs and healthcare  professionals (HCPs) on using AI-based chatbots in caring for individuals with  HNC. A total of six focus groups were conducted with 15 ICs and 13 HCPs from  three Swedish university hospitals. The study uncovers a widespread hesitancy  toward the intention to use AI-based chatbots among ICs and HCPs. Factors  contributing to this reluctance include their distrust in chatbot-provided  information, negative past experiences of using chatbots, and lack of human  connection in chatbot interactions. Embracing a holistic approach is crucial when  designing chatbots, ensuring active user engagement and incorporating their  perspectives into the design process.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study explores the combinations of conditional variables contributing to depressive symptoms in rural children. METHODS: We analyzed data  from 715 children from a rural mental health database, conducting detailed  follow-up investigations on 129 children in Zhejiang and Henan provinces. We used  fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) and regression analysis to  identify causal pathways leading to depression. RESULTS: The results indicate  that depression in rural children does not stem from a single, necessary  condition but arises from multiple factors. Our findings highlight significant  contributions from both maternal and paternal involvement. Specifically, maternal  involvement, combined synergistically with peer support and problematic  behaviors, as well as paternal involvement, together with peer support and  anxiety, significantly affects depressive outcomes. Additionally, anxiety and  strong peer relationships independently have a substantial impact on these  outcomes. Effective mitigation strategies involve active parental engagement and  robust peer support, reducing the influence of risk factors such as problematic  behaviors and anxiety. LIMITATIONS: The generalizability of the results is  limited by cultural and geographical variations. The study also does not account  for all potential factors influencing depression in rural children. CONCLUSION:  Depression in rural children results from multiple interacting factors. Tailored  interventions addressing these specific combinations are recommended.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aims to evaluate the fairness performance metrics of Machine Learning (ML) models to predict hospitalization and emergency department  (ED) visits in heart failure patients receiving home healthcare. We analyze  biases, assess performance disparities, and propose solutions to improve model  performance in diverse subpopulations. METHODS: The study used a dataset of  12,189 episodes of home healthcare collected between 2015 and 2017, including  structured (e.g., standard assessment tool) and unstructured data (i.e., clinical  notes). ML risk prediction models, including Light Gradient-boosting model  (LightGBM) and AutoGluon, were developed using demographic information, vital  signs, comorbidities, service utilization data, and the area deprivation index  (ADI) associated with the patient's home address. Fairness metrics, such as Equal  Opportunity, Predictive Equality, Predictive Parity, and Statistical Parity, were  calculated to evaluate model performance across subpopulations. RESULTS: Our  study revealed significant disparities in model performance across diverse  demographic subgroups. For example, the Hispanic, Male, High-ADI subgroup  excelled in terms of Equal Opportunity with a metric value of 0.825, which was  28% higher than the lowest-performing Other, Female, Low-ADI subgroup, which  scored 0.644. In Predictive Parity, the gap between the highest and  lowest-performing groups was 29%, and in Statistical Parity, the gap reached 69%.  In Predictive Equality, the difference was 45%. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The  findings highlight substantial differences in fairness metrics across diverse  patient subpopulations in ML risk prediction models for heart failure patients  receiving home healthcare services. Ongoing monitoring and improvement of  fairness metrics are essential to mitigate biases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) require an early-stage assessment of potential societal and ethical implications to increase  their acceptability, desirability, and sustainability. This paper explores and  compares 2 of these assessment approaches: the responsible innovation (RI)  framework originating from technology studies and the co-design approach  originating from design studies. While the RI framework has been introduced to  guide early-stage technology assessment through anticipation, inclusion,  reflexivity, and responsiveness, co-design is a commonly accepted approach in the  development of technologies to support the care for older adults with frailty.  However, there is limited understanding about how co-design contributes to the  anticipation of implications. OBJECTIVE: This paper empirically explores how the  co-design process of an AI-based decision support system (DSS) for dementia  caregivers is complemented by explicit anticipation of implications. METHODS:  This case study investigated an international collaborative project that focused  on the co-design, development, testing, and commercialization of a DSS that is  intended to provide actionable information to formal caregivers of people with  dementia. In parallel to the co-design process, an RI exploration took place,  which involved examining project members' viewpoints on both positive and  negative implications of using the DSS, along with strategies to address these  implications. Results from the co-design process and RI exploration were analyzed  and compared. In addition, retrospective interviews were held with project  members to reflect on the co-design process and RI exploration. RESULTS: Our  results indicate that, when involved in exploring requirements for the DSS,  co-design participants naturally raised various implications and conditions for  responsible design and deployment: protecting privacy, preventing cognitive  overload, providing transparency, empowering caregivers to be in control,  safeguarding accuracy, and training users. However, when comparing the co-design  results with insights from the RI exploration, we found limitations to the  co-design results, for instance, regarding the specification, interrelatedness,  and context dependency of implications and strategies to address implications.  CONCLUSIONS: This case study shows that a co-design process that focuses on  opportunities for innovation rather than balancing attention for both positive  and negative implications may result in knowledge gaps related to social and  ethical implications and how they can be addressed. In the pursuit of responsible  outcomes, co-design facilitators could broaden their scope and reconsider the  specific implementation of the process-oriented RI principles of anticipation and  inclusion.

AB  - This research addresses the rapid aging phenomenon prevalent in Asian societies, which has led to a significant increase in elderly individuals relocating to  nursing homes due to health-related issues. This trend has resulted in social  isolation and loneliness among the elderly, contributing to physical and mental  ailments such as hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, as highlighted by the  World Health Organization (WHO). To mitigate these issues, the research proposes  leveraging technology, specifically the integration of robotics, to alleviate the  caregiver shortage and enhance human interaction for the elderly. The novel  approach involves developing a social robot designed to bridge the gap between  humans and machines, combining knowledge from embedded systems, robotics, and  essential soft skills for effective interaction. The authors found that this  technological solution holds promise in addressing the caregiver shortage and  improving the well-being of elderly individuals by reducing their sense of  isolation, fostering better mental and physical health outcomes, and potentially  transforming the landscape of elderly care through innovative technological  applications. Future work includes expanding pilot studies and collaborating with  healthcare institutions to further validate the effectiveness of the solution.

AB  - OvCa patients and caregivers perceived challenges in online health information seeking. The HELPeR recommendation system utilized digital twins to create  personas reflecting real-world OvCa patients and caregivers. The aim of this  study was to describe the creation of digital twins and demonstrate their use  cases in the study. Digital twins of OvCa patients and caregivers were created by  triangulating multiple sources, including online cancer forums, direct interviews  with patients and caregivers, domain expert input, and clinical notes. 10  personas were created for both OvCa patients and caregivers who had a variety of  cancer trajectories and information interests. These digital twins present a  potential solution for training artificial intelligence models at the initial  phase when there is a scarcity of user information.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The rising global elderly population increases the demand for caregiving, yet traditional methods may not fully assess the challenges faced by  vital informal caregivers. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy of Large  Language Model (LLM) in detecting overburdened informal caregivers, benchmarking  against rule-based and machine learning methods. METHODS: 1,791 eligible informal  caregivers from Southern Taiwan and utilized their textual case summary reports  for the LLM. We also employed structured questionnaire results for machine  learning models. Furthermore, we leveraged the visualization of the LLM's  attention mechanisms to enhance our understanding of the model's interpretative  capabilities. RESULTS: The LLM achieved an Area Under the Receiver Operating  Characteristic (AUROC) curve of 0.84 and an Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve  (AUPRC) of 0.70, marking an 8% and 14% improvement over traditional methods. The  visualization of the attention mechanism accurately reflected the evaluations of  human experts, concentrating on descriptions of high-burden descriptions and the  relationships between caregivers and recipients. CONCLUSION: This research  demonstrates the notable capability of LLM to accurately identify high-burden  caregivers in Long-term Care (LTC) settings. Compared to traditional approaches,  LLM offers an opportunity for the future of LTC research and policymaking.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hospital readmission is an important indicator of inpatient care quality and a significant driver of increasing medical costs. Therefore, it is  important to explore the effects of postdischarge information, particularly from  home healthcare notes, on enhancing readmission prediction models. Despite the  use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning in prediction model  development, current studies often overlook insights from home healthcare notes.  OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop prediction models for 30-day readmissions  using home healthcare notes and structured data. In addition, it explored the  development of 14- and 180-day prediction models using variables in the 30-day  model. DESIGN: A retrospective observational cohort study. SETTING(S): This study  was conducted at Ajou University School of Medicine in South Korea. PARTICIPANTS:  Data from electronic health records, encompassing demographic characteristics of  1819 participants, along with information on conditions, drug, and home  healthcare, were utilized. METHODS: Two distinct models were developed for each  prediction window (30-, 14-, 180-day): the traditional model, which utilized  structured variables alone, and the common data model (CDM)-NLP model, which  incorporated structured and topic variables extracted from home healthcare notes.  BERTopic facilitated topic generation and risk probability, representing the  likelihood of documents being assigned to specific topics. Feature selection  involved experimenting with various algorithms. The best-performing algorithm,  determined using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve  (AUROC), was used for model development. Model performance was assessed using  various learning metrics including AUROC. RESULTS: Among 1819 patients, 251  (13.80 %) experienced 30-day readmission. The least absolute shrinkage and  selection operator was used for feature extraction and model development. The 15  structured features were used in the traditional model. Moreover, five additional  topic variables from the home healthcare notes were applied in the CDM-NLP model.  The AUROC of the traditional model was 0.739 (95 % CI: 0.672-0.807). The AUROC of  the CDM-NLP model was high at 0.824 (95 % CI: 0.768-0.880), which indicated an  outstanding performance. The topics in the CDM-NLP model included emotional  distress, daily living functions, nutrition, postoperative status, and  cardiorespiratory issues. In extended prediction model development for 14- and  180-day readmissions, the CDM-NLP consistently outperformed the traditional  model. CONCLUSIONS: This study developed effective prediction models using both  structured and unstructured data, thereby emphasizing the significance of  postdischarge information from home healthcare notes in readmission prediction.

T2  - Journal of medical Internet research
AB  - BACKGROUND: The rising prevalence of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) worldwide and the high recent mortality rates (74.4%) associated with them, especially in  low- and middle-income countries, is causing a substantial global burden of  disease, necessitating innovative and sustainable long-term care solutions.  OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aims to investigate the impact of artificial  intelligence (AI)-based conversational agents (CAs)-including chatbots,  voicebots, and anthropomorphic digital avatars-as human-like health caregivers in  the remote management of NCDs as well as identify critical areas for future  research and provide insights into how these technologies might be used  effectively in health care to personalize NCD management strategies. METHODS: A  broad literature search was conducted in July 2023 in 6 electronic databases-Ovid  MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, PubMed, CINAHL, and Web of Science-using the search  terms "conversational agents," "artificial intelligence," and "noncommunicable  diseases," including their associated synonyms. We also manually searched gray  literature using sources such as ProQuest Central, ResearchGate, ACM Digital  Library, and Google Scholar. We included empirical studies published in English  from January 2010 to July 2023 focusing solely on health care-oriented  applications of CAs used for remote management of NCDs. The narrative synthesis  approach was used to collate and summarize the relevant information extracted  from the included studies. RESULTS: The literature search yielded a total of 43  studies that matched the inclusion criteria. Our review unveiled four significant  findings: (1) higher user acceptance and compliance with anthropomorphic and  avatar-based CAs for remote care; (2) an existing gap in the development of  personalized, empathetic, and contextually aware CAs for effective emotional and  social interaction with users, along with limited consideration of ethical  concerns such as data privacy and patient safety; (3) inadequate evidence of the  efficacy of CAs in NCD self-management despite a moderate to high level of  optimism among health care professionals regarding CAs' potential in remote  health care; and (4) CAs primarily being used for supporting nonpharmacological  interventions such as behavioral or lifestyle modifications and patient education  for the self-management of NCDs. CONCLUSIONS: This review makes a unique  contribution to the field by not only providing a quantifiable impact analysis  but also identifying the areas requiring imminent scholarly attention for the  ethical, empathetic, and efficacious implementation of AI in NCD care. This  serves as an academic cornerstone for future research in AI-assisted health care  for NCD management. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Open Science Framework;  https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/GU5PX.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Informal care plays an essential role in managing the COVID-19 pandemic. Expanding health insurance packages that reimburse caregivers' services  through cost-sharing policies could increase financial resources. Predicting  payers' willingness to contribute financially accurately is essential for  implementing such a policy. This study aimed to identify the key variables  related to WTP/WTA of COVID-19 patients for informal care in Sanandaj city, Iran.  METHODS: This cross-sectional study involved 425 COVID-19 patients in Sanandaj  city, Iran, and 23 potential risk factors. We compared the performance of three  classifiers based on total accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, negative  likelihood ratio, and positive likelihood ratio. RESULTS: Findings showed that  the average total accuracy of all models was over 70%. Random trees had the most  incredible total accuracy for both patient WTA and patient WTP(0.95 and 0.92).  Also, the most significant specificity (0.93 and 0.94), sensitivity (0.91 and  0.87), and the lowest negative likelihood ratio (0.193 and 0.19) belonged to this  model. According to the random tree model, the most critical factor in patient  WTA were patient difficulty in personal activities, dependency on the caregiver,  number of caregivers, patient employment, and education, caregiver employment and  patient hospitalization history. Also, for WTP were history of COVID-19 death of  patient's relatives, and patient employment status. CONCLUSION: Implementing of a  more flexible work schedule, encouraging employer to support employee to provide  informal care, implementing educational programs to increase patients' efficacy,  and providing accurate information could lead to increased patients' willingness  to contribute and finally promote health outcomes in the population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are the leading cause of death in children under the age of 5 globally. Maternal healthcare-seeking behavior may  help minimize mortality associated with ARIs since they make decisions about the  kind and frequency of healthcare services for their children. Therefore, this  study aimed to predict the absence of maternal healthcare-seeking behavior and  identify its associated factors among children under the age 5 in sub-Saharan  Africa (SSA) using machine learning models. METHODS: The sub-Saharan African  countries' demographic health survey was the source of the dataset. We used a  weighted sample of 16,832 under-five children in this study. The data were  processed using Python (version 3.9), and machine learning models such as extreme  gradient boosting (XGB), random forest, decision tree, logistic regression, and  Naïve Bayes were applied. In this study, we used evaluation metrics, including  the AUC ROC curve, accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure, to assess the  performance of the predictive models. RESULT: In this study, a weighted sample of  16,832 under-five children was used in the final analysis. Among the proposed  machine learning models, the random forest (RF) was the best-predicted model with  an accuracy of 88.89%, a precision of 89.5%, an F-measure of 83%, an AUC ROC  curve of 95.8%, and a recall of 77.6% in predicting the absence of mothers'  healthcare-seeking behavior for ARIs. The accuracy for Naïve Bayes was the lowest  (66.41%) when compared to other proposed models. No media exposure, living in  rural areas, not breastfeeding, poor wealth status, home delivery, no ANC visit,  no maternal education, mothers' age group of 35-49 years, and distance to health  facilities were significant predictors for the absence of mothers'  healthcare-seeking behaviors for ARIs. On the other hand, undernourished children  with stunting, underweight, and wasting status, diarrhea, birth size, married  women, being a male or female sex child, and having a maternal occupation were  significantly associated with good maternal healthcare-seeking behaviors for ARIs  among under-five children. CONCLUSION: The RF model provides greater predictive  power for estimating mothers' healthcare-seeking behaviors based on ARI risk  factors. Machine learning could help achieve early prediction and intervention in  children with high-risk ARIs. This leads to a recommendation for policy direction  to reduce child mortality due to ARIs in sub-Saharan countries.

T2  - Journal of evaluation in clinical practice
AB  - RATIONALE: Artificial Intelligence (AI) large language models (LLM) are tools capable of generating human-like text responses to user queries across topics.  The use of these language models in various medical contexts is currently being  studied. However, the performance and content quality of these language models  have not been evaluated in specific medical fields. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: This  study aimed to compare the performance of AI LLMs ChatGPT, Gemini and Copilot in  providing information to parents about chronic kidney diseases (CKD) and compare  the information accuracy and quality with that of a reference source. METHODS: In  this study, 40 frequently asked questions about CKD were identified. The accuracy  and quality of the answers were evaluated with reference to the Kidney Disease:  Improving Global Outcomes guidelines. The accuracy of the responses generated by  LLMs was assessed using F1, precision and recall scores. The quality of the  responses was evaluated using a five-point global quality score (GQS). RESULTS:  ChatGPT and Gemini achieved high F1 scores of 0.89 and 1, respectively, in the  diagnosis and lifestyle categories, demonstrating significant success in  generating accurate responses. Furthermore, ChatGPT and Gemini were successful in  generating accurate responses with high precision values in the diagnosis and  lifestyle categories. In terms of recall values, all LLMs exhibited strong  performance in the diagnosis, treatment and lifestyle categories. Average GQ  scores for the responses generated were 3.46 ± 0.55, 1.93 ± 0.63 and 2.02 ± 0.69  for Gemini, ChatGPT 3.5 and Copilot, respectively. In all categories, Gemini  performed better than ChatGPT and Copilot. CONCLUSION: Although LLMs provide  parents with high-accuracy information about CKD, their use is limited compared  with that of a reference source. The limitations in the performance of LLMs can  lead to misinformation and potential misinterpretations. Therefore, patients and  parents should exercise caution when using these models.

TI  - Care Providers' Perspectives on the Design of Assistive Persuasive Behaviors for Socially Assistive Robots.
AU  - Getson, Cristina
AU  - Nejat, Goldie
T2  - Journal of the American Medical Directors Association
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The main objectives of this research are (1) to uniquely design assistive behaviors for socially assistive robots using the principles of  persuasion from behavioral psychology, and (2) to investigate caregivers'  perspectives and opinions on the use of these behaviors to engage and motivate  older adults in cognitive activities. DESIGN: We developed 10 unique robot  persuasive assistive behavior strategies for the social robot Pepper using both  verbal and nonverbal communication modes. Robot verbal behaviors were designed  using Cialdini's principles of persuasion; nonverbal behaviors included expansive  movements of the body. Care providers' perceptions of the quality, strength, and  persuasiveness of these robot persuasive behaviors were assessed based on the  Perceived Argument Strength Likert scale. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Eighteen  formal and informal care providers caring for older adults including those living  with mild cognitive impairments participated. METHODS: An online survey was  designed consisting of short videos of the Pepper robot displaying each behavior.  After viewing each video, care providers completed the Perceived Argument  Strength Likert scale to evaluate 6 attributes for each behavior. They also  provided comments. RESULTS: Results show robot assistive behaviors using praise  with emotion, along with emotion with commitment were the most positively rated  by care providers. Qualitative responses indicate robot body language and speech  quality were influencing factors in how a person perceives assistance in  human-robot interactions. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Our findings provide new  insights into incorporating persuasive strategies into the design of assistive  social robot behaviors with the aim of engaging and motivating older adults in an  activity. The majority of care providers rated the robot persuasive behaviors  positively. In designing a persuasive socially assistive robot for older adults,  it is beneficial to display a combination of persuasive strategies, such as  praise and commitment with emotion, to address individual users' needs and  cognitive levels.

AB  - This paper explores the ways in which health care professionals, family carers, and older persons expressed attitudes and opinions on using Paro, a social robot  designed to stimulate patients with dementia. Thereafter, we critically evaluate  existing prejudicial views toward Paro users to provide recommendations for its  future use. Using an exploratory qualitative interview method, we recruited a  total of 67 participants in Switzerland. They included 23 care professionals, 17  family carers, and 27 older persons. Data obtained were analyzed thematically.  Study findings present general agreement that Paro is an appealing and beneficial  social robot, but it is not a tool that everyone feels comfortable with. Because  it is perceived as "child play," it would be demeaning for competent adults to  play with such things. Consequently, Paro is appropriate only for persons with  dementia. These findings brought forth ethical concerns about deception,  infantilization, and respecting older persons' dignity. The idea of who is an  appropriate Paro user led to our discussions on predicting future Paro users. The  meaning of using social robotics in nursing homes can be conditioned by a rigid  interpretation of adulthood and playful behavior. To protect future selves when  one is living with dementia from prejudices, it may be useful for older persons  and their loved ones to plan their future care situations to ensure that they are  treated in accordance with their delineated decisions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adolescent weight problems have become a growing public health concern, making early prediction of non-normal weight status crucial for  effective prevention. However, few temporal prediction tools for adolescent four  weight status have been developed. This study aimed to predict the short- and  long-term weight status of Hong Kong adolescents and assess the importance of  predictors. METHODS: A population-based retrospective cohort study of adolescents  was conducted using data from a territory-wide voluntary annual health assessment  service provided by the Department of Health in Hong Kong. Using diet habits,  physical activity, psychological well-being, and demographics, we generated six  prediction models for successive weight status (normal, overweight, obese and  underweight) using multiclass Decision Tree, Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbor,  eXtreme gradient boosting, support vector machine, logistic regression. Model  performance was evaluated by multiple standard classifier metrics and the overall  accuracy. Predictors' importance was assessed using Shapley values. RESULTS:  442,898 Primary 4 (P4, Grade 4 in the US) and 344,186 in Primary 6 (P6, Grade 6  in the US) students, with followed up until their Secondary 6 (Grade 12 in the  US) during the academic years 1995/96 to 2014/15 were included. The XG Boosts  model consistently outperformed all other model in predicting the long-term  weight status at S6 from P4 or P6. It achieved an overall accuracy of 0.72 or  0.74, a micro-averaging AUC of 0.92 or 0.93, and a macro-averaging AUC of 0.83 or  0.86, respectively. XG Boost also demonstrated accurate predictions for each  predicted weight status, surpassing the AUC values obtained by other models.  Weight, height, sex, age, frequency and hours of aerobic exercise were  consistently the most important predictors for both cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: The  machine learning approaches accurately predict adolescent weight status in both  short- and long-term. The developed multiclass model that utilizing easy-assessed  variables enables accurate long-term prediction on weight status, which can be  used by adolescents and parents for self-prediction when applied in health care  system. The interpretable models may help to provide the early and individualized  interventions suggestions for adolescents with weight problems particularly.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Home health care patients who are at risk for becoming Incapacitated with No Evident Advance Directives or Surrogates (INEADS) may benefit from timely  intervention to assist them with advance care planning. This study aimed to  develop natural language processing algorithms for identifying home care patients  who do not have advance directives, family members, or close social contacts who  can serve as surrogate decision-makers in the event that they lose decisional  capacity. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study of electronic health records. SETTING AND  PARTICIPANTS: Patients receiving post-acute care discharge services from a large  home health agency in New York City in 2019 (n = 45,390 enrollment episodes).  METHODS: We developed a natural language processing algorithm for identifying  information documented in free-text clinical notes (n = 1,429,030 notes) related  to 4 categories: evidence of close relationships, evidence of advance directives,  evidence suggesting lack of close relationships, and evidence suggesting lack of  advance directives. We validated the algorithm against Gold Standard clinician  review for 50 patients (n = 314 notes) to calculate precision, recall, and  F-score. RESULTS: Algorithm performance for identifying text related to the 4  categories was excellent (average F-score = 0.91), with the best results for  "evidence of close relationships" (F-score = 0.99) and the worst results for  "evidence of advance directives" (F-score = 0.86). The algorithm identified 22%  of all clinical notes (313,290 of 1,429,030) as having text related to 1 or more  categories. More than 98% of enrollment episodes (48,164 of 49,141) included at  least 1 clinical note containing text related to 1 or more categories.  CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: This study establishes the feasibility of creating  an automated screening algorithm to aid home health care agencies with  identifying patients at risk of becoming INEADS. This screening algorithm can be  applied as part of a multipronged approach to facilitate clinician support for  advance care planning with patients at risk of becoming INEADS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Machine learning techniques (MLT) build models to detect complex patterns and solve new problems using big data. AIM: The present study aims to  create a prediction interface for mothers breastfeeding exclusively for the first  6 months using MLT. METHOD: All mothers who had babies aged 6-24 months between  15.09.2021 and 15.12.2021 and to whom the surveys could be delivered were  included. 'Personal Information Form' created by the researchers was used as a  data collection tool. Data from 514 mothers participating in the study were used  for MLT. Data from 70% of mothers were used for educational purposes, and a  prediction model was created. The data obtained from the remaining 30% of the  mothers were used for testing. RESULTS: The best MLT algorithm for predicting  exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months was determined to be the Random  Forest Classifier. The top five variables affecting the possibility of mothers  breastfeeding exclusively for the first 6 months were as follows: "the mother not  having any health problems during pregnancy," "there were no people who  negatively affected the mother's morale about breastfeeding," "the amount of  water the mother drinks in a day," "thinking that her milk supply is  insufficient," "having no problems breastfeeding the baby". CONCLUSIONS: Using  created prediction model may allow early identification of mothers with a risk of  not breastfeeding their babies exclusively for the first 6 months. In this way,  mothers in the risk group can be closely monitored in the early period.

AB  - Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and cell therapies like CAR-T are costly, complex therapeutic procedures. Outpatient models, including at-home  transplantation, have been developed, resulting in similar survival results,  reduced costs, and increased patient satisfaction. The complexity and safety of  the process can be addressed with various emerging technologies (artificial  intelligence, wearable sensors, point-of-care analytical devices, drones, virtual  assistants) that allow continuous patient monitoring and improved decision-making  processes. Patients, caregivers, and staff can also benefit from improved  training with simulation or virtual reality. However, many technical,  operational, and above all, ethical concerns need to be addressed. Finally,  outpatient or at-home hematopoietic transplantation or CAR-T therapy creates a  different, integrated operative system that must be planned, designed, and  carefully adapted to the patient's characteristics and distance from the  hospital. Patients, clinicians, and their clinical environments can benefit from  technically improved at-home transplantation.

AU  - Persson, Marcus

T2  - Sociology of health & illness
AB  - While previous research studies have focused on either caregivers' or residents' perception and use of social robots, this article offers an empirical and  theoretical examination of joint activities in triadic human-robot interaction.  The symptomatology of dementia creates an asymmetrical relation wherein the  impetus to employ a robot often originates from the caregiver. Drawing on field  work and video recorded interactions in dementia care homes, the article  investigates how caregivers draw on embodied resources to involve residents and  robot animals in interaction. The analysis demonstrates how caregivers promote  commitment and encounter resistance with residents. We draw on the theory of  sociomaterial interactionism to study situated interaction between bodies in a  meaning-generating process. By re-conceptualising the theoretical notions of  manipulation and recruitment, the article offers an approach for studying  orientations that distinguish between reciprocity of agential objects. We show  that caregivers usually distinguish between interactions with people and machines  by anticipating a specific response from the robots (manipulation), while they  invite participation in a broader sense from residents (recruitment). Social  friction arises, however, if caregivers act upon the residents as embodied  objects in manipulative ways.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) such as ChatGPT by OpenAI holds great promise to improve the quality of life of patients with dementia and their  caregivers by providing high-quality responses to their questions about typical  dementia behaviors. So far, however, evidence on the quality of such ChatGPT  responses is limited. A few recent publications have investigated the quality of  ChatGPT responses in other health conditions. Our study is the first to assess  ChatGPT using real-world questions asked by dementia caregivers themselves.  OBJECTIVES: This pilot study examines the potential of ChatGPT-3.5 to provide  high-quality information that may enhance dementia care and patient-caregiver  education. METHODS: Our interprofessional team used a formal rating scale  (scoring range: 0-5; the higher the score, the better the quality) to evaluate  ChatGPT responses to real-world questions posed by dementia caregivers. We  selected 60 posts by dementia caregivers from Reddit, a popular social media  platform. These posts were verified by 3 interdisciplinary dementia clinicians as  representing dementia caregivers' desire for information in the areas of memory  loss and confusion, aggression, and driving. Word count for posts in the memory  loss and confusion category ranged from 71 to 531 (mean 218; median 188),  aggression posts ranged from 58 to 602 words (mean 254; median 200), and driving  posts ranged from 93 to 550 words (mean 272; median 276). RESULTS: ChatGPT's  response quality scores ranged from 3 to 5. Of the 60 responses, 26 (43%)  received 5 points, 21 (35%) received 4 points, and 13 (22%) received 3 points,  suggesting high quality. ChatGPT obtained consistently high scores in  synthesizing information to provide follow-up recommendations (n=58, 96%), with  the lowest scores in the area of comprehensiveness (n=38, 63%). CONCLUSIONS:  ChatGPT provided high-quality responses to complex questions posted by dementia  caregivers, but it did have limitations. ChatGPT was unable to anticipate future  problems that a human professional might recognize and address in a clinical  encounter. At other times, ChatGPT recommended a strategy that the caregiver had  already explicitly tried. This pilot study indicates the potential of AI to  provide high-quality information to enhance dementia care and patient-caregiver  education in tandem with information provided by licensed health care  professionals. Evaluating the quality of responses is necessary to ensure that  caregivers can make informed decisions. ChatGPT has the potential to transform  health care practice by shaping how caregivers receive health information.

T2  - BMC health services research
AB  - BACKGROUND: People with physical disabilities due to disease or injury face barriers to their daily activities and participation in society. Many depend on  formal or informal caregivers for assistance to live independently. However,  future healthcare challenges due to demographic changes threaten access to home  care and assistants. Assistive technologies, such as robots for physical  assistance, can support the independence and autonomy of people with physical  disabilities. This study explore Norwegian care-receivers' perceptions of using  robot assistance in their homes, including preferences for tasks acceptable or  unacceptable for robot assistance and the underlying reasons. METHOD: Purposive  sampling was employed to recruit 18 participants, aged between 18 and 77 years,  with differences in physical function including diagnoses such as stroke, spinal  cord injury, amputations, and muscular dystrophy. Qualitative data were gathered  through four focus group interviews wherein participants watched videos featuring  a humanoid assistive robot, EVEr3. The collected data underwent analysis using  reflexive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Three themes with associated sub-themes  were constructed: (a) How a robot could assist in daily life, (b) The robot's  appearance and functionality, and (c) Concerns about having a robot as an  assistant. The participants welcomed the idea of a future robotic assistant in  areas that may contribute to an increased feeling of independence and autonomy.  CONCLUSION: A robot assisting in activities of daily living would need to be  individually customized to meet the needs of each user in terms of which tasks to  assist with, how to assist in these defined tasks, and how it is controlled.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Stroke remains a major cause of long-term adult disability in the United States, necessitating the need for effective rehabilitation strategies for  post-stroke gait impairments. Despite advancements in post-stroke care, existing  rehabilitation often falls short, prompting the development of devices like  robots and exoskeletons. However, these technologies often lack crucial input  from end-users, such as clinicians, patients, and caregivers, hindering their  clinical utility. Employing a human-centered design approach can enhance the  design process and address user-specific needs. OBJECTIVE: To establish a  proof-of-concept of the human-centered design approach by refining the NewGait®  exosuit device for post-stroke gait rehabilitation. METHODS: Using iterative  design sprints, the research focused on understanding the perspectives of  clinicians, stroke survivors, and caregivers. Two design sprints were conducted,  including empathy interviews at the beginning of the design sprint to integrate  end-users' insights. After each design sprint, the NewGait device underwent  refinements based on emerging issues and recommendations. The final prototype  underwent mechanical testing for durability, biomechanical simulation testing for  clinical feasibility, and a system usability evaluation, where the new  stroke-specific NewGait device was compared with the original NewGait device and  a commercial product, Theratogs®. RESULTS: Affinity mapping from the design  sprints identified crucial categories for stakeholder adoption, including fit for  females, ease of donning and doffing, and usability during barefoot walking. To  address these issues, a system redesign was implemented within weeks,  incorporating features like a loop-backed neoprene, a novel closure mechanism for  the shoulder harness, and a hook-and-loop design for the waist belt. Additional  improvements included reconstructing anchors with rigid hook materials and  replacing latex elastic bands with non-latex silicone-based bands for enhanced  durability. Further, changes to the dorsiflexion anchor were made to allow for  barefoot walking. Mechanical testing revealed a remarkable 10-fold increase in  durability, enduring 500,000 cycles without notable degradation. Biomechanical  simulation established the modularity of the NewGait device and indicated that it  could be configured to assist or resist different muscles during walking.  Usability testing indicated superior performance of the stroke-specific NewGait  device, scoring 84.3 on the system usability scale compared to 62.7 for the  original NewGait device and 46.9 for Theratogs. CONCLUSION: This study  successfully establishes the proof-of-concept for a human-centered design  approach using design sprints to rapidly develop a stroke-specific gait  rehabilitation system. Future research should focus on evaluating the clinical  efficacy and effectiveness of the NewGait device for post-stroke rehabilitation.

With oncologist input, we designed an interface that presents  patient-specific, machine learning-based 6-month survival prognosis information  designed to aid oncology providers in preparing for and discussing prognosis with  patients with advanced solid tumors and their caregivers. The primary purpose of  this study was to assess patient and caregiver perceptions and identify  enhancements of the interface for communicating 6-month survival and other  prognosis information when making treatment decisions concerning anticancer and  supportive therapy. METHODS: This qualitative study included interviews and focus  groups conducted between November and December 2022. Purposive sampling was used  to recruit former patients with cancer and/or former caregivers of patients with  cancer who had participated in cancer treatment decisions from Utah or elsewhere  in the United States. Categories and themes related to perceptions of the  interface were identified. RESULTS: We received feedback from 20 participants  during eight individual interviews and two focus groups, including four cancer  survivors, 13 caregivers, and three representing both. Overall, most participants  expressed positive perceptions about the tool and identified its value for  supporting decision making, feeling less alone, and supporting communication  among oncologists, patients, and their caregivers. Participants identified areas  for improvement and implementation considerations, particularly that oncologists  should share the tool and guide discussions about prognosis with patients who  want to receive the information. CONCLUSION: This study revealed important  patient and caregiver perceptions of and enhancements for the proposed interface.  Originally designed with input from oncology providers, patient and caregiver  participants identified additional interface design recommendations and  implementation considerations to support communication about prognosis.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Falls are a major worldwide health problem in older people. Several physical rehabilitation programs with home-based technologies, such as the online  DigiRehab platform, have been successfully delivered. The PRECISE project  combines personalized training delivered through the application with an  artificial intelligence-based predictive model (AI-DSS platform) for fall risk  assessment. This new system, called DigiRehab, will enable early identification  of significant risk factors for falling and propose an individualized physical  training plan to attend to these critical areas. METHODS: The study will test the  usability of the DigiRehab platform in generating personalized physical  rehabilitation programs at home. Fifty older adults participants will be  involved, 20 of them testing the beta version prototype, and 30 participants  testing the updated version afterwards. The inclusion criteria will be age ≥65,  independent ambulation, fall risk (Tinetti test), Mini Mental State Examination  ≥24, home residents, familiarity with web applications, ability and willingness  to sign informed consent. Exclusion criteria will be unstable clinical condition,  severe visual and/or hearing impairment, severe impairment in Activities of Daily  Living and absence of primary caregiver. DISCUSSION: The first part of the  screening consists in a structured questionnaire of 10 questions regarding the  user's limitations, including the risk of falling, while the second consists in  10 physical tests to assess the functional status. Based on the results, the  program will help define the user's individual profile upon which the DSS  platform will rate the risk of falling and design the personalized exercise  program to be carried out at home. All measures from the initial screening will  be repeated and the results will be used to optimize the predictive algorithms in  order to prepare the tool in its final version. For the usability assessment, the  System Usability Scale will be administered. The follow-up will take place after  the 12-week intervention at home. A semi-structured satisfaction questionnaire  will also be administered to verify whether the project will meet the needs of  older adults and their family caregiver. CONCLUSION: We expect that personalized  training prescribed by DigiRehab platform could help to reduce the need for care  in older adults subjects and the care burden.Clinical trial registration:  [https://clinicaltrials.gov/], identifier [NCT05846776].

AB  - The objective of this study is to develop and evaluate natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning models to predict infant feeding status  from clinical notes in the Epic electronic health records system. The primary  outcome was the classification of infant feeding status from clinical notes using  Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms. Annotation of notes was completed using  TeamTat to uniquely classify clinical notes according to infant feeding status.  We trained 6 machine learning models to classify infant feeding status: logistic  regression, random forest, XGBoost gradient descent, k-nearest neighbors, and  support-vector classifier. Model comparison was evaluated based on overall  accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Our modeling corpus included an even  number of clinical notes that was a balanced sample across each class. We  manually reviewed 999 notes that represented 746 mother-infant dyads with a mean  gestational age of 38.9 weeks and a mean maternal age of 26.6 years. The most  frequent feeding status classification present for this study was exclusive  breastfeeding [n = 183 (18.3%)], followed by exclusive formula bottle feeding  [n = 146 (14.6%)], and exclusive feeding of expressed mother's milk [n = 102  (10.2%)], with mixed feeding being the least frequent [n = 23 (2.3%)]. Our final  analysis evaluated the classification of clinical notes as breast,  formula/bottle, and missing. The machine learning models were trained on these  three classes after performing balancing and down sampling. The XGBoost model  outperformed all others by achieving an accuracy of 90.1%, a macro-averaged  precision of 90.3%, a macro-averaged recall of 90.1%, and a macro-averaged F1  score of 90.1%. Our results demonstrate that natural language processing can be  applied to clinical notes stored in the electronic health records to classify  infant feeding status. Early identification of breastfeeding status using NLP on  unstructured electronic health records data can be used to inform precision  public health interventions focused on improving lactation support for postpartum  patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The most common form of dementia, Alzheimer's Disease (AD), is challenging for both those affected as well as for their care providers, and  caregivers. Socially assistive robots (SARs) offer promising supportive care to  assist in the complex management associated with AD. OBJECTIVES: To conduct a  scoping review of published articles that proposed, discussed, developed or  tested SAR for interacting with AD patients. METHODS: We performed a scoping  review informed by the methodological framework of Arksey and O'Malley and  adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses  extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist for reporting the results.  At the identification stage, an information specialist performed a comprehensive  search of 8 electronic databases from the date of inception until January 2022 in  eight bibliographic databases. The inclusion criteria were all populations who  recive or provide care for AD, all interventions using SAR for AD and our  outcomes of inteerst were any outcome related to AD patients or care providers or  caregivers. All study types published in the English language were included.  RESULTS: After deduplication, 1251 articles were screened. Titles and abstracts  screening resulted to 252 articles. Full-text review retained 125 included  articles, with 72 focusing on daily life support, 46 on cognitive therapy, and 7  on cognitive assessment. CONCLUSION: We conducted a comprehensive scoping review  emphasizing on the interaction of SAR with AD patients, with a specific focus on  daily life support, cognitive assessment, and cognitive therapy. We discussed our  findings' pertinence relative to specific populations, interventions, and  outcomes of human-SAR interaction on users and identified current knowledge gaps  in SARs for AD patients.

AB  - This study aimed to: (1) validate a natural language processing (NLP) system developed for the home health care setting to identify signs and symptoms of  Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) documented in clinicians'  free-text notes; (2) determine whether signs and symptoms detected via NLP help  to identify patients at risk of a new ADRD diagnosis within four years after  admission. This study applied NLP to a longitudinal dataset including medical  record and Medicare claims data for 56,652 home health care patients and Cox  proportional hazard models to the subset of 24,874 patients admitted without an  ADRD diagnosis. Selected ADRD signs and symptoms were associated with increased  risk of a new ADRD diagnosis during follow-up, including: motor issues;  hoarding/cluttering; uncooperative behavior; delusions or hallucinations; mention  of ADRD disease names; and caregiver stress. NLP can help to identify patients in  need of ADRD-related evaluation and support services.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Colonoscopy is a critical diagnostic tool for colorectal diseases; however, its effectiveness depends on adequate bowel preparation (BP). This study  aimed to develop a machine learning predictive model based on Chinese adults for  inadequate BP. METHODS: A multicenter prospective study was conducted on adult  outpatients undergoing colonoscopy from January 2021 to May 2023. Data on patient  characteristics, comorbidities, medication use, and BP quality were collected.  Logistic regression and 4 machine learning models (support vector machines,  decision trees, extreme gradient boosting, and bidirectional projection network)  were used to identify risk factors and predict inadequate BP. RESULTS: Of 3,217  patients, 21.14% had inadequate BP. The decision trees model demonstrated the  best predictive capacity with an area under the receiver operating characteristic  curve of 0.80 in the validation cohort. The risk factors at the nodes included  body mass index, education grade, use of simethicone, diabetes, age, history of  inadequate BP, and longer interval. DISCUSSION: The decision trees model we  created and the identified risk factors can be used to identify patients at  higher risk of inadequate BP before colonoscopy, for whom more polyethylene  glycol or auxiliary medication should be used.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adolescent non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a major public health issue. Family factors are significantly associated with NSSI in adolescents,  while studies on forecasting NSSI at the family level are still limited. In  addition to regression methods, machine learning (ML) techniques have been  recommended to improve the accuracy of family-level risk prediction for NSSI.  METHODS: Using a dataset of 7967 students and their primary caregivers from a  cross-sectional study, logistic regression model and random forest model were  used to test the forecasting accuracy of NSSI predictions at the family level.  Cross-validation was used to assess model prediction performance, including the  area under the receiver operator curve (AUC), precision, Brier score, accuracy,  sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive  value. RESULTS: The top three important family-related predictors within the  random forest algorithm included family function (importance:42.66), family  conflict (importance:42.18), and parental depression (importance:27.21). The most  significant family-related risk predictors and protective predictors identified  by the logistic regression model were family history of mental illness (OR:2.25)  and help-seeking behaviors of mental distress from parents (OR:0.65),  respectively. The AUCs of the two models, logistic regression and random forest,  were 0.852 and 0.835, respectively. LIMITATIONS: The key limitation is that this  cross-sectional survey only enabled the authors to examine predictors that were  considered to be proximal rather than distal. CONCLUSIONS: These findings  highlight the significance of family-related factors in forecasting NSSI in  adolescents. Combining both conventional statistical methods and ML methods to  improve risk assessment of NSSI at the family level deserves attention.

AB  - Cancer caregivers are often informal family members who may not be prepared to adequately meet the needs of patients and often experience high stress along with  significant physical, emotional, and financial burdens. Accurate prediction of  caregiver's burden level is highly valuable for early intervention and support.  In this study, we used several machine learning approaches to build prediction  models from the National Alliance for Caregiving/AARP dataset. We performed data  cleansing and imputation on the raw data to give us a working dataset of cancer  caregivers. Then a series of feature selection methods were used to identify  predictive risk factors for burden level. Using supervised machine learning  classifiers, we achieved reasonably good prediction performance (Accuracy ∼ 0.94;  AUC ∼ 0.97; F1∼ 0.93). We identify a small set of 15 features that are strong  predictors of burden and can be used to build Clinical Decision Support Systems.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Family caregivers of people with Alzheimer's disease experience conflicts as they navigate health care but lack training to resolve these  disputes. We sought to develop and pilot test an artificial-intelligence  negotiation training program, NegotiAge, for family caregivers. METHODS: We  convened negotiation experts, a geriatrician, a social worker, and  community-based family caregivers. Content matter experts created short videos to  teach negotiation skills. Caregivers generated dialogue surrounding conflicts.  Computer scientists utilized the dialogue with the Interactive Arbitration Guide  Online (IAGO) platform to develop avatar-based agents (e.g., sibling, older  adult, physician) for caregivers to practice negotiating. Pilot testing was  conducted with family caregivers to assess usability (USE) and satisfaction  (open-ended questions with thematic analysis). RESULTS: Development: With  NegotiAge, caregivers progress through didactic material, then receive scenarios  to negotiate (e.g., physician recommends gastric tube, sibling disagrees with  home support, older adult refusing support). Caregivers negotiate in real-time  with avatars who are designed to act like humans, including emotional tactics and  irrational behaviors. Caregivers send/receive offers, using tactics until either  mutual agreement or time expires. Immediate feedback is generated for the user to  improve skills training. Pilot testing: Family caregivers (n = 12) completed the  program and survey. USE questionnaire (Likert scale 1-7) subset scores revealed:  (1) Useful-Mean 5.69 (SD 0.76); (2) Ease-Mean 5.24 (SD 0.96); (3) Learn-Mean 5.69  (SD 0.74); (4) Satisfy-Mean 5.62 (SD 1.10). Items that received over 80%  agreements were: It helps me be more effective; It helps me be more productive;  It is useful; It gives me more control over the activities in my life; It makes  the things I want to accomplish easier to get done. Participants were highly  satisfied and found NegotiAge fun to use (91.7%), with 100% who would recommend  it to a friend. CONCLUSION: NegotiAge is an Artificial-Intelligent Caregiver  Negotiation Program, that is usable and feasible for family caregivers to become  familiar with negotiating conflicts commonly seen in health care.

AB  - In the United States, regulatory changes dictate telehealth activities. Telehealth was available to patients on home dialysis as early as 2019, allowing  patients to opt for telehealth with home as the originating site and without  geographic restriction. In 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 was an unexpected  accelerant for telehealth use in the United States. Within nephrology, remote  patient monitoring has most often been applied to the care of patients on home  dialysis modalities. The effect that remote and virtual technologies have on home  dialysis patients, telehealth and health care disparities, and health care  providers' workflow changes are discussed here. Moreover, the future use of  remote and virtual technologies to include artificial intelligence and artificial  neural network model to optimize and personalize treatments will be highlighted.  Despite these advances in technology challenges continue to exist, leaving room  for future innovation to improve patient health outcome and equity. Prospective  studies are needed to further understand the effect of using virtual technologies  and remote monitoring on home dialysis outcomes, cost, and patient engagement.

AB  - Skin tears occur mainly in older adults, making it difficult to identify the wound area and severity level when making care decision. We propose an algorithm  for estimating the wound area and severity level of skin tears using a deep  learning method. In this study, U-Net was used to estimate the skin tear area and  VGG16 was used to estimate the severity level. The deep learning method shows an  Intersection of Union (IoU) of 0.58 and 0.65 in estimating wound areas and  purpura areas, and 62.2% accuracy in estimating severity levels. The proposed  method outperforms the previous method using a classical machine learning method.  This indicates that the proposed deep learning method is promising for image  processing for skin tears, even if the skin tears include narrow wound edges and  flaps, which are difficult to distinguish from the wound area.Clinical  relevance-The proposed method can automatically estimate the area and severity  level of skin tears to assist caregivers who are unfamiliar with skin tears.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Medication management has a key role in the daily tasks of home care professionals delivered to older clients in home care. The aim of this study was  to examine the effect of using a robot for medication management on home care  professionals´ use of working time. METHODS: A pragmatic non-randomized  controlled clinical trial was conducted. The participants were home care  professionals who carried out home care clients' medication management. Home care  clients were allocated into intervention groups (IG) and control groups (CG)  (n = 64 and 46, respectively) based on whether or not they received the robot.  Data were collected using the Working Time Tracking Form prior to and 1 and 2  months after introducing the intervention. The t-test was used to compare the  groups at each three timepoints. Analysis of Covariance was used to examine the  groups' differences for the total time for medications as the number of visits  per day as the covariate. RESULTS: With robot use, the total amount of home  visits decreased by 89.4% and 92.4% after 1 and 2 months of intervention use,  respectively, compared to pre-intervention (p < 0.001). The total working time  used for medication management considering the number of visits per day decreased  from 54.2 min (95% CI 37.4-44.3) to 34.9 min (31.4-38.3), i.e., by slightly over  19 min (p < 0.001) in the IG group. During the follow-up, the total working time  used for medication management considering the number of visits per day remained  the same in the CG group. CONCLUSION: Using a robot for medication management had  a notable effect on decreasing the use of working time of home care  professionals. For health services, decreased use of working time for medication  management means that the time saved can be assigned to services that cannot be  replaced otherwise. More digital solutions should be developed based on home care  clients' and professionals' needs to meet the challenge of the growing number of  older people in need of home care and ensure their safety.

AB  - PURPOSE: The advent of new medical devices allows patients with asthma to self-monitor at home, providing a more complete picture of their disease than  occasional in-person clinic visits. This raises a pertinent question: which  devices and parameters perform best in exacerbation detection? METHODS: A total  of 149 patients with asthma (90 children, 59 adults) participated in a 6-month  observational study. Participants (or parents) regularly (daily for the first 2  weeks and weekly for the next 5.5 months, with increased frequency during  exacerbations) performed self-examinations using 3 devices: an artificial  intelligence (AI)-aided home stethoscope (providing wheezes, rhonchi, and coarse  and fine crackles intensity; respiratory and heart rate; and  inspiration-to-expiration ratio), a peripheral capillary oxygen saturation  (SpO(2)) meter, and a peak expiratory flow (PEF) meter and filled out a health  state survey. The resulting 6,029 examinations were evaluated by physicians for  the presence of exacerbations. For each registered parameter, a machine learning  model was trained, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve  (AUC) was calculated to assess its utility in exacerbation detection. RESULTS:  The best single-parameter discriminators of exacerbations were wheezes intensity  for young children (AUC 84% [95% CI, 82%-85%]), rhonchi intensity for older  children (AUC 81% [95% CI, 79%-84%]), and survey answers for adults (AUC 92% [95%  CI, 89%-95%]). The greatest efficacy (in terms of AUC) was observed for a  combination of several parameters. CONCLUSIONS: The AI-aided home stethoscope  provides reliable information on asthma exacerbations. The parameters provided  are effective for children, especially those younger than 5 years of age. The  introduction of this tool to the health care system might enhance asthma  exacerbation detection substantially and make remote monitoring of patients  easier.

T2  - Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)
AB  - It is important for older and disabled people who live alone to be able to cope with the daily challenges of living at home. In order to support independent  living, the Smart Home Care (SHC) concept offers the possibility of providing  comfortable control of operational and technical functions using a mobile robot  for operating and assisting activities to support independent living for elderly  and disabled people. This article presents a unique proposal for the  implementation of interoperability between a mobile robot and KNX technology in a  home environment within SHC automation to determine the presence of people and  occupancy of occupied spaces in SHC using measured operational and technical  variables (to determine the quality of the indoor environment), such as  temperature, relative humidity, light intensity, and CO(2) concentration, and to  locate occupancy in SHC spaces using magnetic contacts monitoring the  opening/closing of windows and doors by indirectly monitoring occupancy without  the use of cameras. In this article, a novel method using nonlinear  autoregressive Neural Networks (NN) with exogenous inputs and nonlinear  autoregressive is used to predict the CO(2) concentration waveform to transmit  the information from KNX technology to mobile robots for monitoring and  determining the occupancy of people in SHC with better than 98% accuracy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Issues regarding clinician communication remain an important source of complaints within healthcare. This systematic review aims to determine cancer  patients' and their family caregivers' views on which clinicians' communication  behaviors can harm (i.e. eliciting negative feelings/consequences for  patients/family caregivers). METHODS: We searched for all types of peer-reviewed  studies that determined adult (≥18 years) cancer patients' and/or family  caregivers' perspectives on which clinicians' communication behaviors can harm in  several databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Emcare,  PsycINFO and Academic Search Premier), supplemented by expert-consultation.  Studies were screened using the Artificial intelligence screening tool of  ASReview and data was analyzed using Thematic Analysis. To assess the quality of  the studies the Qualsyst critical appraisal tool was used. RESULTS: A total of 47  studies were included. Four main themes of harmful communication behaviors were  identified: (1) Lack of tailored information provision (e.g. giving too little or  too much/specific information) (2) Lack of tailored decision making (ranging  from; patient exclusion, to the patients' responsibility, and/or haste) (3) Lack  of feeling seen and heard (seen as a disease, not as a human being; not listened  to concerns and emotions) (4) Lack of feeling held and remembered (forgotten  agreements; lack of care continuity). CONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal an overview  of patients' and family caregivers' perspectives on which clinicians'  communication behaviors can harm. Harm could be prevented when information and  decision involvement are tailored and patients' and family caregivers' needs to  feel seen, heard, held and remembered are met.

T2  - JMIR human factors
AB  - BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI)-based home care systems and devices are being gradually integrated into health care delivery to benefit patients with  chronic diseases. However, existing research mainly focuses on the technical and  clinical aspects of AI application, with an insufficient investigation of  patients' motivation and intention to adopt such systems. OBJECTIVE: This study  aimed to examine the factors that affect the motivation of patients with chronic  diseases to adopt AI-based home care systems and provide empirical evidence for  the proposed research hypotheses. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional  web-based survey with 222 patients with chronic diseases based on a hypothetical  scenario. RESULTS: The results indicated that patients have an overall positive  perception of AI-based home care systems. Their attitudes toward the technology,  perceived usefulness, and comfortability were found to be significant factors  encouraging adoption, with a clear understanding of accountability being a  particularly influential factor in shaping patients' attitudes toward their  motivation to use these systems. However, privacy concerns persist as an indirect  factor, affecting the perceived usefulness and comfortability, hence influencing  patients' attitudes. CONCLUSIONS: This study is one of the first to examine the  motivation of patients with chronic diseases to adopt AI-based home care systems,  offering practical insights for policy makers, care or technology providers, and  patients. This understanding can facilitate effective policy formulation, product  design, and informed patient decision-making, potentially improving the overall  health status of patients with chronic diseases.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has garnered tremendous attention in health care, and many hope that AI can enhance our health system's ability to care for people  with chronic and degenerative conditions, including Parkinson's Disease (PD).  This paper reports the themes and lessons derived from a qualitative study with  people living with PD, family caregivers, and health care providers regarding the  ethical dimensions of using AI to monitor, assess, and predict PD symptoms and  progression. Thematic analysis identified ethical concerns at four intersecting  levels: personal, interpersonal, professional/institutional, and societal levels.  Reflecting on potential benefits of predictive algorithms that can continuously  collect and process longitudinal data, participants expressed a desire for more  timely, ongoing, and accurate information that could enhance management of  day-to-day fluctuations and facilitate clinical and personal care as their  disease progresses. Nonetheless, they voiced concerns about intersecting ethical  questions around evolving illness identities, familial and professional care  relationships, privacy, and data ownership/governance. The multi-layer analysis  provides a helpful way to understand the ethics of using AI in monitoring and  managing PD and other chronic/degenerative conditions.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The motor disability due to stroke compromises the autonomy of patients and caregivers. To support autonomy and other personal and social needs,  trustworthy, multifunctional, adaptive, and interactive assistive devices  represent optimal solutions. To fulfill this aim, an artificial intelligence  system named MAIA would aim to interpret users' intentions and translate them  into actions performed by assistive devices. Analyzing their perspectives is  essential to develop the MAIA system operating in harmony with patients' and  caregivers' needs as much as possible. METHODS: Post-stroke patients and  caregivers were interviewed to explore the impact of motor disability on their  lives, previous experiences with assistive technologies, opinions, and attitudes  about MAIA and their needs. Interview transcripts were analyzed using inductive  thematic analysis. RESULTS: Sixteen interviews were conducted with 12 post-stroke  patients and four caregivers. Three themes emerged: (1) Needs to be satisfied,  (2) MAIA technology acceptance, and (3) Perceived trustfulness. Overall, patients  are seeking rehabilitative technology, contrary to caregivers needing assistive  technology to help them daily. An easy-to-use and ergonomic technology is  preferable. However, a few participants trust a system based on artificial  intelligence. CONCLUSION: An interactive artificial intelligence technology could  help post-stroke patients and their caregivers to restore motor autonomy. The  insights from participants to develop the system depends on their motor ability  and the role of patients or caregiver. Although technology grows exponentially,  more efforts are needed to strengthen people's trust in advanced technology.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Given the increasing number of dementia patients worldwide, a new method was developed for machine learning models to identify the 'latent needs'  of patients and caregivers to facilitate patient/public involvement in societal  decision making. METHODS: Japanese transcribed interviews with 53 dementia  patients and caregivers were used. A new morpheme selection method using Z-scores  was developed to identify trends in describing the latent needs. F-measures with  and without the new method were compared using three machine learning models.  RESULTS: The F-measures with the new method were higher for the support vector  machine (SVM) (F-measure of 0.81 with the new method and F-measure of 0.79  without the new method for patients) and Naive Bayes (F-measure of 0.69 with the  new method and F-measure of 0.67 without the new method for caregivers and  F-measure of 0.75 with the new method and F-measure of 0.73 without the new  method for patients). CONCLUSION: A new scheme based on Z-score adaptation for  machine learning models was developed to predict the latent needs of dementia  patients and their caregivers by extracting data from interviews in Japanese.  However, this study alone cannot be used to assign significance to the adaptation  of the new method because of no enough size of sample dataset. Such pre-selection  with Z-score adaptation from text data in machine learning models should be  considered with more modified suitable methods in the near future.

AB  - Social robot pets promote engagement and psychosocial well-being among older adults, yet little is known about their use among community-dwelling Veterans  living with dementia. This programmatic evaluation used a within subjects,  pre-post design to examine the usability (frequency of use, frequency of  caregiver reminders) and acceptability (benefit, satisfaction) of social robot  pets among Veterans with dementia (N = 20). An intervention usability and  acceptability tool was completed by telephone with family caregivers 3 months  after delivery of the pet to the home. Overall, 80% of Veterans used the pet  often or daily, while 7 caregivers provided reminders for the Veteran to use the  pet. Caregivers indicated that Veterans experienced benefit with the pet, as well  themselves. Regarding satisfaction, 89% reported they would recommend a social  robot pet to others. Research is needed to expand generalizability, evaluate  effects on outcomes, and enhance implementation of social robot pets among  Veteran families with dementia.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop a natural language processing (NLP) system that identified social risk factors in home health care (HHC) clinical notes and  to examine the association between social risk factors and hospitalization or an  emergency department (ED) visit. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING AND  PARTICIPANTS: We used standardized assessments and clinical notes from one HHC  agency located in the northeastern United States. This included 86,866 episodes  of care for 65,593 unique patients. Patients received HHC services between 2015  and 2017. METHODS: Guided by HHC experts, we created a vocabulary of social risk  factors that influence hospitalization or ED visit risk in the HHC setting. We  then developed an NLP system to automatically identify social risk factors  documented in clinical notes. We used an adjusted logistic regression model to  examine the association between the NLP-based social risk factors and  hospitalization or an ED visit. RESULTS: On the basis of expert consensus, the  following social risk factors emerged: Social Environment, Physical Environment,  Education and Literacy, Food Insecurity, Access to Care, and Housing and Economic  Circumstances. Our NLP system performed "very good" with an F score of 0.91.  Approximately 4% of clinical notes (33% episodes of care) documented a social  risk factor. The most frequently documented social risk factors were Physical  Environment and Social Environment. Except for Housing and Economic  Circumstances, all NLP-based social risk factors were associated with higher odds  of hospitalization and ED visits. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: HHC clinicians  assess and document social risk factors associated with hospitalizations and ED  visits in their clinical notes. Future studies can explore the social risk  factors documented in HHC to improve communication across the health care system  and to predict patients at risk for being hospitalized or visiting the ED.

AB  - To date, research on ethical issues regarding care robots for older adults, family caregivers, and care workers has not progressed sufficiently. This study  aimed to build a model that universally explains the relationship between the use  of care robots and ethical awareness, such as regarding personal information and  privacy protection in home care. We examined data obtained from cross-sectional  surveys conducted in Japan (n=528), Ireland (n=296), and Finland (n=180). We  performed a confirmatory factor analysis by using responses to 11 items related  to the ethical use of care robots. We evaluated the model based on the chi-square  to degrees of freedom ratio, the comparative fit index, and the root mean square  error of approximation. Subsequently, we compared the model with the Akaike's  information criterion. Ten items were adopted in the final model. There were 4  factors in the model: 'acquisition of personal information', 'use of personal  information for medical and long-term care', 'secondary use of personal  information', and 'participation in research and development'. All factor  loadings of the final model ranged between 0.63 and 0.92, which were greater than  0.6, showing that the factors had a high influence on the model. The final model  was applied to each country; the fit was relatively good in Finland and poor in  Ireland. Although the three countries have different geographies, cultures,  demographics, and systems, this study showed that the impact of ethical issues  regarding the use of care robots in home care can be universally explained by the  same model.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Social robots, as a form of digital health technologies, are used to support emotional, cognitive, and physical care and have shown promising outcomes  in enhancing social well-being in people with dementia (PwD) by boosting  emotions, social interactions, and activity participation. OBJECTIVE: The goal is  to investigate the attitude of stakeholders and potential facilitators and the  barriers to implementing the social robot MINI in community-based meeting centers  (MCs) for PwD and carers in the Netherlands and Spain. METHODS: Based on the  British Medical Research Council guidance for process evaluation of the  implementation of complex interventions and the model for tracing the  facilitators of and barriers to the adaptive implementation of innovations in  dementia care, an explorative qualitative study was conducted. Following the  introduction of the MINI robot, 11 stakeholders were interviewed in 3 MCs in the  Netherlands and 1 in Spain, as well as stakeholders in health and welfare  organizations in both countries. In addition, 12 adults with dementia  participated in focus groups. The data were thematically analyzed and narratively  described. RESULTS: Overall, the stakeholder opinion and interest in the MINI  robot were positive. The most important (expected) facilitating factors mentioned  by stakeholders appeared to be human resources, funding, the impact of the MINI  robot on the users and programs of the MCs, characteristics of the innovation,  and collaboration with other care and welfare organizations. However, the  (expected) barriers mentioned concerned the physical context and functionalities  of the MINI robot, the user context, and MC activity policies. CONCLUSIONS: The  findings will inform professional stakeholders, such as MC directors and  managers, as well as care and welfare organizations, on the practicality of using  the MINI robot in MCs. Furthermore, our research will aid MINI robot developers  in tailoring its features to PwD's preferences and demands and MC policies, which  will contribute to the MINI robot's effective adoption and deployment.

T2  - Palliative & supportive care
AB  - OBJECTIVES: With a fraction of hospices having their Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS®) scores on Hospice Compare, a  significant reservoir of hospice quality data remains in online caregiver  reviews. The purpose of this study was to develop a method and model of hospice  quality assessment from caregiver reviews using Watson's carative model. METHODS:  Retrospective mixed methods of pilot qualitative thematic analysis and sentiment  analysis using NLP of Google and Yelp caregiver reviews between 2013 and 2023. We  employed stratified sampling, weighted according to hospice size, to emulate the  daily census of enrollees across the United States. Sentiment analysis was  performed (n = 3393) using Google NLP. RESULTS: Two themes with the highest  prevalence had moderately positive sentiments (S): Caring staff (+.47) and Care  quality, comfort and cleanliness (+.41). Other positive sentiment scores with  high prevalence were Gratitude and thanks (+.81), "Treating the patient with  respect" (+.54), and "Emotional, spiritual, bereavement support" (+.60). Lowest  sentiment scores were "Insurance, administrative or billing" (-.37), "Lack of  staffing" (-.32), and "Communication with the family" (-.01). SIGNIFICANCE OF  RESULTS: In the developed quality model, caregivers recommended hospices with  caring staff, providing quality care, responsive to requests, and offering family  support, including bereavement care. All ten Watson's carative factors and all  eight CAHPS measures were presented in the discovered review themes of the  quality model. Close-ended CAHPS scores and open-ended online reviews have  substantial conceptual overlap and complementary insights. Future hospice quality  research should explore caregiver expectations and compare review themes by  profit status.

AB  - We compared emotional valence scores as determined via machine learning approaches to human-coded scores of direct messages on Twitter from our 2,301  followers during a Twitter-based clinical trial screening for Hispanic and  African American family caregivers of persons with dementia. We manually assigned  emotional valence scores to 249 randomly selected direct Twitter messages from  our followers (N=2,301), then we applied three machine learning sentiment  analysis algorithms to extract emotional valence scores for each message and  compared their mean scores to the human coding results. The aggregated mean  emotional scores from the natural language processing were slightly positive,  while the mean score from human coding as a gold standard was negative. Clusters  of strongly negative sentiments were observed in followers' responses to being  found non-eligible for the study, indicating a significant need for alternative  strategies to provide similar research opportunities to non-eligible family  caregivers.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: In ageing societies, the number of older adults with complex chronic conditions (CCCs) is rapidly increasing. Care for older persons with CCCs  is challenging, due to interactions between multiple conditions and their  treatments. In home care and nursing homes, where most older persons with CCCs  receive care, professionals often lack appropriate decision support suitable and  sufficient to address the medical and functional complexity of persons with CCCs.  This EU-funded project aims to develop decision support systems using  high-quality, internationally standardised, routine care data to support better  prognostication of health trajectories and treatment impact among older persons  with CCCs. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Real-world data from older persons aged ≥60  years in home care and nursing homes, based on routinely performed comprehensive  geriatric assessments using interRAI systems collected in the past 20 years, will  be linked with administrative repositories on mortality and care use. These  include potentially up to 51 million care recipients from eight countries: Italy,  the Netherlands, Finland, Belgium, Canada, USA, Hong Kong and New Zealand.  Prognostic algorithms will be developed and validated to better predict various  health outcomes. In addition, the modifying impact of pharmacological and  non-pharmacological interventions will be examined. A variety of analytical  methods will be used, including techniques from the field of artificial  intelligence such as machine learning. Based on the results, decision support  tools will be developed and pilot tested among health professionals working in  home care and nursing homes. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study was approved by  authorised medical ethical committees in each of the participating countries, and  will comply with both local and EU legislation. Study findings will be shared  with relevant stakeholders, including publications in peer-reviewed journals and  presentations at national and international meetings.

T2  - The American journal of hospice & palliative care
AB  - Objectives: With an untapped quality resource in online hospice reviews, study aims were exploring hospice caregiver experiences and assessing their  expectations of the hospice Medicare benefit. Methods: Topical and sentiment  analysis was conducted using natural language processing (NLP) of Google and Yelp  caregiver reviews (n = 3393) between 2013-2023 using Google NLP. Stratified  sampling weighted by hospice size to approximate the daily census of US hospice  enrollees. Results: Overall caregiver sentiment of hospice care was neutral (S =  .14). Therapeutic, achievable expectations and misperceptions, unachievable  expectations were, respectively, the most and least prevalent domains. Four  topics with the highest prevalence, all had moderately positive sentiments:  caring staff, staff professionalism and knowledge; emotional, spiritual,  bereavement support; and responsive, timely or helpful. Lowest sentiments scores  were lack of staffing; promises made, but not kept, pain, symptoms and  medications; sped-up death, hasted, or sedated; and money, staff motivations.  Significance of Results: Caregivers overall rating of hospice was neutral,  largely due to moderate sentiment on achievable expectations in two-thirds of  reviews mixed with unachievable expectations in one-sixth of reviews. Hospice  caregivers were most likely to recommend hospices with caring staff, providing  quality care, responsive to requests, and offering family support. Lack of staff,  inadequate pain-symptom management were the two biggest barriers to hospice  quality. All eight CAHPS measures were found in the discovered review topics.  Close-ended CAHPS scores and open-ended online reviews have complementary  insights. Future research should explore associations between CAHPS and review  insights.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to introduce a research methodology for the assessment of the acceptability of a humanoid robot at home for children with  cochlear implants (CI). The quality of audiology rehabilitation for cochlear  implanted child administrated at the hospital with pluri-weekly sessions is a  major prognostic factor in the outcome on communications abilities, but  represents also a constraint for families related to the access to care that are  more difficult. Further, home training with tools would balance the equitable  distribution of care in the territory and promote the child's progress. The  humanoid robot should allow an ecological approach to this complementary  training. Before developing this approach, it is necessary to study the  acceptability of the humanoid robot at home, both by cochlear implanted child and  their families. Ten families were chosen to have a humanoid robot at home, to  explore their acceptability of the humanoid robot Pepper. The study lasts for 1  month per participants (i.e. cochlear implemented children and parent).  Participants were invited to use the robot at home as much as they want. The  humanoid robot Pepper was able to communicate and proposed activities not related  to rehabilitation. Once a week during the study, data were collected from  participants (questionnaires and robot's logs) and the smooth running of the  study was checked. Questionnaires are used to evaluate the acceptability of the  robot by children and parents. User data from the robot's logs are used to  quantify the time and the actual use of the robot over the period of the study.  Results of the experimentation will be reported, once all 10 participants have  completed their passation. The robot is anticipated to be used and accepted by  children with cochlear implants and their families. Clinical trial registration:  Clinical Trials ID: NCT04832373; https://clinicaltrials.gov/.

AB  - The main purpose of the study is to develop an estimation model using machine learning algorithms and to ensure the effective and efficient implementation of  home health care service planning in hospitals with these algorithms. The  necessary approvals for the study were obtained. The data set was created by  obtaining patient data (except for data such as Turkish Republic identification  number) from 14 hospitals providing Home Health Care Services in the city of  Diyarbakır. The data set was subjected to necessary pre-processing and  descriptive statistics were applied. For the estimation model, Decision Tree,  Random Forest and Multi-layer Perceptron Neural Network algorithms were used. It  was found that the number of days of home health care service, which the patients  received, varied depending on their age and gender. It was observed that the  patients were generally in the disease groups that required Physiotherapy and  Rehabilitation treatments. It was determined that the length of service for  patients can be predicted with a high reliability rate (Multi-Layer Model Acc:  90.4%, Decision Tree Model Acc: 86.4%, Random Forest Model Acc: 88.5%) using  machine learning algorithms. In the light of the findings and data patterns  obtained in the study, it is thought that effective and efficient planning will  be made in terms of health management. In addition, it is believed that  estimating the average length of service for patients will contribute to  strategic planning of human resources for health, and to reducing medical  consumables, drugs and hospital expenses.

AB  - This study developed and validated a rule-based classification algorithm for prediabetes risk detection using natural language processing from home care  nursing notes. First, we developed prediabetes-related symptomatic terms in  English and Korean. Second, we used natural language processing to preprocess the  notes. Third, we created a rule-based classification algorithm with 31 484 notes,  excluding 315 instances of missing data. The final algorithm was validated by  measuring accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score against a gold standard  testing set (400 notes). The developed terms comprised 11 categories and 1639  words in Korean and 1181 words in English. Using the rule-based classification  algorithm, 42.2% of the notes comprised one or more prediabetic symptoms. The  algorithm achieved high performance when applied to the gold standard testing  set. We proposed a rule-based natural language processing algorithm to optimize  the classification of the prediabetes risk group, depending on whether the home  care nursing notes contain prediabetes-related symptomatic terms. Tokenization  based on white space and the rule-based algorithm were brought into effect to  detect the prediabetes symptomatic terms. Applying this algorithm to electronic  health records systems will increase the possibility of preventing diabetes onset  through early detection of risk groups and provision of tailored intervention.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Computer tools based on artificial intelligence could aid clinicians in memory clinics by supporting diagnostic decision-making and  communicating diagnosis and prognosis. We aimed to identify preferences of  end-users, and barriers and facilitators for using computer tools in memory  clinics. METHODS: Between July and October 2020, we invited European clinicians  (n=109, age 45±10y; 47% female) to participate in an online questionnaire. A  second questionnaire was sent to patients (n=50, age 73±8y, 34% female) with  subjective cognitive complaints (SCD, n=21), mild cognitive impairment (MCI,  n=16) and dementia (n=13) and care partners (n=46, 65±12y, 54% female). RESULTS:  The vast majority (75%) of all participants positively valued the use of computer  tools in memory clinics. Facilitating factors included user-friendliness and  increased diagnostic accuracy. Barriers included (doubts relating) reliability  and validity of the tool and loss of clinical autonomy. The participants believe  that tools should be used in addition to the current working method and not as a  replacement. DISCUSSION: Our results provide an important step in the iterative  process of developing computer tools for memory clinics in co-creation with  end-users and could guide successful implementation.

AB  - In the present study, we aimed to quantify the effects of COVID-19 restrictions and speech treatment approaches during lockdowns on autistic children using CBCL  and neuro-fuzzy artificial intelligence method. In this regard, a survey  including CBCL questionnaire is prepared using online forms. In total, 87  children with diagnosed Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) participated in the  survey. The influences of three treatment approaches of in-person, telehealth and  public services along with no-treatment condition during lockdown were the main  factors of the investigation. The main output factors were internalized and  externalized problems in general and their eight subcategory syndromes. We  examined the reports by parents/caregivers to find correlation between treatments  and CBCL listed problems. Moreover, comparison of the eight syndromes rating  scores from pre-lockdown to post-lockdown periods were performed. In addition,  artificial intelligence method were engaged to find the influence of speech  treatment during restrictions on the level of internalizing and externalizing  problems. In this regard, a fully connected adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system  is employed with type and duration of treatments as input and T-scores of the  syndromes are the output of the network. The results indicate that restrictions  alleviate externalizing problems while intensifying internalizing problems. In  addition, it is concluded that in-person speech therapy is the most effective and  satisfactory approach to deal with ASD children during stay-at-home periods.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Language development is a highly interactive activity. However, most research on linguistic environment has focused on the quantity and complexity of  linguistic input to children, with current models showing that complexity  facilitates language in both typically developing (TD) and autistic children.  AIMS: After reviewing existing work on caregiver engagement of children's  utterances, we aim to operationalize such engagement with automated measures of  linguistic alignment, thereby providing scalable tools to assess caregivers'  active reuse of their children's language. By assessing the presence of  alignment, its sensitivity to the child's individual differences and how well it  predicts language development beyond current models across the two groups, we  showcase the usefulness of the approach and provide initial empirical foundations  for further conceptual and empirical investigations. METHODS: We measure lexical,  syntactic and semantic types of caregiver alignment in a longitudinal corpus  involving 32 adult-autistic child and 35 adult-TD child dyads, with children  between 2 and 5 years of age. We assess the extent to which caregivers repeat  their children's words, syntax, and semantics, and whether these repetitions  predict language development beyond more standard predictors. RESULTS: Caregivers  tend to re-use their child's language in a way that is related to the child's  individual, primarily linguistic, differences. Caregivers' alignment provides  unique information improving our ability to predict future language development  in both typical and autistic children. CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence that  language development also relies on interactive conversational processes,  previously understudied. We share carefully detailed methods, and open-source  scripts so as to systematically extend our approach to new contexts and  languages.

T2  - Health policy (Amsterdam, Netherlands)
AB  - Adopting an ethics and human rights lens, this paper provides a critical analysis of national dementia care guidance from countries ranked highly in providing  quality of care towards the end-of-life, including Australia, Ireland, New  Zealand, Switzerland, Taiwan and the United Kingdom. The aim of this paper is to  determine areas of consensus and disagreement among guidance and to understand  current gaps in research. Overall, studied guidances showed consensus regarding  patient empowerment and engagement, promoting independence, autonomy and  liberty through; establishing person-centered care plans, providing ongoing care  assessment, resources and support to individuals and their family/carers.  Consensus was also seen in most end-of-life care issues; re-assessing care plans,  rationalizing medication, and most importantly carer support and well-being.  Disagreement could be found in criteria relating to decision-making after losing  capacity, i.e. through appointment of case managers or a power of attorney,  reducing barriers to equitable access of care, stigma and discrimination for  minority and disadvantaged groups - including younger people with dementia,  medicalized care strategies such as alternatives to hospitalization, covert  administration, and assisted hydration and nutrition, and also in identifying an  active dying phase. Potential for future development includes a greater emphasis  on multidisciplinary collaborations, financial and welfare assistance, exploring  the use of artificial intelligence technologies for testing and management, while  also providing safeguards against such emerging technologies and therapies.

BACKGROUND: The Artificial Intelligence in Visual Impairment (AIVI)  Study is a proof-of-concept study to investigate whether ongoing information  support for people with visual impairment (VI) can be provided by a  dialogue-based digital assistant. The phase of the AIVI Study reported here  explored the different dimensions of the information-seeking behaviour of  individuals with VI: in particular, their need for information, the methods for  obtaining it at present, and their views on the use of a digital assistant.  METHODS: Qualitative data were collected from 120 UK-resident adults who  responded to an online survey who were either visually impaired (86.7%), a carer  or family member of someone with VI (5.8%), or a professional involved in the  support of those with VI (7.5%). In addition, 10 in-depth 1:1 semi-structured  interviews explored opinions in more detail. Thematic analysis was used to  analyse the findings. RESULTS: Analysis of information needs identified 7 major  themes: ocular condition; equipment, technology and adaptations; daily  activities; registration; finance/employment; emotional support; and support for  the carer. Participants used a wide variety of methods to access information from  many sources and explained the barriers to access. Participants accepted the  merit of a dialogue system aiding in a goal-directed search for specific  information, but expressed reservations about its abilities in other areas, such  as providing emotional support. CONCLUSIONS: Participants highlighted potential  benefits, limitations, and requirements in using a digital assistant to access  information about VI. These findings will inform the design of dialogue systems  for populations with VI.

AB  - Early detection of visual impairment is crucial but is frequently missed in young children, who are capable of only limited cooperation with standard vision tests.  Although certain features of visually impaired children, such as facial  appearance and ocular movements, can assist ophthalmic practice, applying these  features to real-world screening remains challenging. Here, we present a mobile  health (mHealth) system, the smartphone-based Apollo Infant Sight (AIS), which  identifies visually impaired children with any of 16 ophthalmic disorders by  recording and analyzing their gazing behaviors and facial features under visual  stimuli. Videos from 3,652 children (≤48 months in age; 54.5% boys) were  prospectively collected to develop and validate this system. For detecting visual  impairment, AIS achieved an area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of  0.940 in an internal validation set and an AUC of 0.843 in an external validation  set collected in multiple ophthalmology clinics across China. In a further test  of AIS for at-home implementation by untrained parents or caregivers using their  smartphones, the system was able to adapt to different testing conditions and  achieved an AUC of 0.859. This mHealth system has the potential to be used by  healthcare professionals, parents and caregivers for identifying young children  with visual impairment across a wide range of ophthalmic disorders.

AB  - Home healthcare in the Italian health system has proven to be an essential factor in adequately responding to the health needs of an increasingly aging population.  The opportunities offered by digitization and new technologies, such as  artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics, are a lever for making home care  services more effective and efficient on the one hand, and on the other for  improving remote patient monitoring. Telemedicine devices have enormous potential  for telemonitoring and telerehabilitation of patients suffering from chronic  disabling diseases; in particular, AI systems can now provide very useful  managerial and decision-making support in numerous clinical areas. AI combined  with digitalization, could also allow for the remote monitoring of patients'  health conditions. In this paper authors describe some digital and healthcare  tools or system of AI, such as the Connected Care model, the Home Care Premium  (HCP) project, The Resilia App and some professional service robotics. In this  context, to optimize potential and concrete healthcare improvements, some limits  need to be overcome: gaps in health information systems and digital tools at all  levels of the Italian National Health Service, the slow dissemination of the  computerized medical record, issues of digital literacy, the high cost of  devices, the poor protection of data privacy. The danger of over-reliance on such  systems should also be examined. Therefore the legal systems of the various  countries, including Italy, should indicate clear decision-making paths for the  patient.

AB  - Although the older population has been rapidly growing, the availability of formal caregivers remains limited. Assistance provided by care robots has helped  lower this burden; however, whether using a care robot while providing excretion  care (EC) is quantitatively increasing or decreasing caregivers' physical care  burden has not been extensively studied. This study aimed to quantitatively  compare the physical burden experienced by caregivers while providing manual  excretion care (MC) using a paper diaper versus robot-aided care (RC). Ten formal  caregivers voluntarily participated in the experiment. MC and RC tasks were  structuralized according to phases and classified by characteristics. The  experiment was conducted in a smart care space. The physical load of formal  caregivers was estimated by muscular activity and subjective rating of perceived  physical discomfort. The results demonstrated that although the physical load on  the lower back and upper extremities during the preparation and post-care phases  were greater in RC than MC, RC markedly alleviated caregivers' physical load when  performing front tasks. In the preparation-care phases, the physical loads on the  lower back and upper extremities were approximately 40.2 and 39.6% higher in the  case of RC than MC, respectively. Similar to the preparation-care phases, the  physical loads on the lower back and upper extremities during post-care phases  were approximately 39.5 and 61.7% greater in the case of RC than MC,  respectively. On the other hand, in the front-care phases, the physical loads on  the lower back and upper extremities were approximately 25.6 and 34.9% lower in  the case of RC than MC, respectively. These findings can quantitatively explain  the effectiveness and features of a care robot to stakeholders and provide  foundational research data for the development of EC robots. This study  emphasizes the implementation and promotion of the dissemination, popularization,  and development of care robots to fulfill formal caregiving needs.

T2  - Scandinavian journal of caring sciences
AB  - BACKGROUND: Home-living older people with multiple medications are a key target group for medication robots. However, our understanding of how robots for  medicines management work in older people's daily lives is limited. AIM: The aim  of this study was to describe older home care clients' experiences of the  implementation and use of a robot for medicines management at home. DESIGN: A  qualitative interview study. METHODS: Data were collected during spring and  autumn 2021 using semi-structured individual interviews with older home care  clients (n = 38). The data were analysed using inductive content analysis.  RESULTS: The older home care clients had positive experiences with the use of  technology for the medication process, but they also faced challenges in their  daily life activities. Implementation and use of the robot required  open-mindedness, satisfaction with the implementation, and the opportunity to  practice the use of the robot with a nurse. However, the current design and size  of the robot for medicines management in home care still need development, given  that our research participants did not feel included in the robot development  process. CONCLUSION: The use of digital solutions will increase older people's  home care. Therefore, there is a need to deepen our understanding of the  implementation and use of digital solutions to prevent digital challenges and to  provide a more comprehensive picture of this phenomenon. In addition, research  focusing on whether the use of the robot affects medication administration  incidents and medication adherence should be conducted to improve the safety of  medicines management.

AB  - Care robots have the potential to address the challenge of aging societies, such as labor shortages or the aging workforce. While previous studies have focused  mainly on the productivity or workability of care robots, there has been an  increasing need to understand the social value of care robots. This study  attempted to identify the social values of care robots by conducting focus group  interviews (FGIs) with twenty-four care recipients and caregivers and by using  analytic hierarchy processes (AHPs) with thirteen individuals with expertise in  the care service and care robot industries. Our results show that the labor- and  health-related benefits, the technology innovation, and the provision of  essential care work have the highest importance among the criteria of care  robots' social values. The criteria that receive lowest priority are cost, the  autonomy and needs of the care recipients, and the organizational innovation. Our  study suggests that along with the private benefits and costs of care robots,  their social values also need to be considered to improve the quality of care and  to unlock the potential of the care robot industries.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Persons living with dementia and their care partners place a high value on aging in place and maintaining independence. Socially assistive robots -  embodied characters or pets that provide companionship and aid through social  interaction - are a promising tool to support these goals. There is a growing  commercial market for these devices, with functions including medication  reminders, conversation, pet-like behaviours, and even the collection of health  data. While potential users generally report positive feelings towards social  robots, persons with dementia have been under-included in design and development,  leading to a disconnect between robot functions and the real-world needs and  desires of end-users. Furthermore, a key element of social and emotional  connectedness in human relationships is emotional alignment - a state where all  partners have congruent emotional understandings of a situation. Strong emotional  alignment between users and robots will be necessary for social robots to provide  meaningful companionship, but a computational model of how to achieve this has  been absent from the field. To this end, we propose and test Affect Control  Theory (ACT) as a framework to improve emotional alignment between older adults  and social robotics. METHOD: Using a Canadian online survey, we introduced  respondents to three exemplar social robots with older adult-specific  functionalities and evaluated their responses around features, emotions, and  ethics using standardized and novel measures (n=171 older adults, n=28 care  partners, and n=7 persons living with dementia). RESULT: Overall, participants  responded positively to the robots. High priority uses included companionship,  interaction, and safety. Reasoning around robot use was pragmatic; curiosity and  entertainment were motivators to use, while a perceived lack of need and the  mechanical appearance of the robots were detractors. Realistic, cute, and cuddly  robots were preferred while artificial-looking, creepy, and toy-like robots were  disliked. Most importantly, our evidence supported ACT as a viable model of  human-robot emotional alignment. CONCLUSION: This work supports the development  of emotionally sophisticated, evidence-based, and user-centered social robotics  with older adult- and dementia-specific functionality.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Using a friendship framework, we explored interactions between a multi-functional companion robot and older adults residing in a low-resource  community in South Korea. METHODS: We conducted in-depth interviews with 12 older  adults who kept a doll-shaped companion robot called Hyodol for 18 months on  average. We applied the Framework Analysis Method to explore three types of  friendship (i.e., friendships of utility, pleasure, and the good) that  participants cultivated with the robot. RESULTS: The most common aspect of  utility companionship reported by all participants was Hyodol's role as their  health coach who reminded them to take medication and to exercise. Participants  also found pleasure in playing with Hyodol and reported reduced feelings of  loneliness. In the absence of other social supports, all participants also  regarded Hyodol as a surrogate family member or human-friend, and interacted with  Hyodol as such. CONCLUSIONS: Findings illustrated high acceptability of Hyodol  among these socially isolated older adults especially during the global COVID-19  pandemic, suggesting that a humanoid like Hyodol could be complementary to  homecare services for solo-living older adults. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:  Well-designed robot interventions, as complements to existing aging service and  clinical interventions, have a potential to improve health behaviors among  socially isolated older adults.

AB  - The global population is aging due to many factors, including longer life expectancy through better healthcare, changing diet, physical activity, etc. We  are also witnessing various frequent epidemics as well as pandemics. The existing  healthcare system has failed to deliver the care and support needed to our older  adults (seniors) during these frequent outbreaks. Sophisticated sensor-based  in-home care systems may offer an effective solution to this global crisis. The  monitoring system is the key component of any in-home care system. The evidence  indicates that they are more useful when implemented in a non-intrusive manner  through different visual and audio sensors. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and  Computer Vision (CV) techniques may be ideal for this purpose. Since the RGB  imagery-based CV technique may compromise privacy, people often hesitate to  utilize in-home care systems which use this technology. Depth, thermal, and  audio-based CV techniques could be meaningful substitutes here. Due to the need  to monitor larger areas, this review article presents a systematic discussion on  the state-of-the-art using depth sensors as primary data-capturing techniques. We  mainly focused on fall detection and other health-related physical patterns. As  gait parameters may help to detect these activities, we also considered depth  sensor-based gait parameters separately. The article provides discussions on the  topic in relation to the terminology, reviews, a survey of popular datasets, and  future scopes.

AB  - Comparing a family structure to a company, one can often think of parents as leaders and adolescents as employees. Stressful family environments and anxiety  levels, depression levels, personality disorders, emotional regulation  difficulties, and childhood trauma may all contribute to non-suicidal self-injury  (NSSI) behaviors. We presented a support vector machine (SVM) based method for  discovering the key factors among mazy candidates that affected NSSI in  adolescents. Using SVM as the base learner, and the binary dragonfly algorithm  was used to find the feature combination that minimized the objective function,  which took into account both the prediction error and the number of selected  variables. Unlike univariate model analysis, we used a multivariate model to  explore the risk factors, which better revealed the interactions between factors.  Our research showed that adolescent education level, anxiety and depression  level, borderline and avoidant personality traits, as well as emotional abuse and  physical neglect in childhood, were associated with mood disorders in  adolescents. Furthermore, gender, adolescent education level, physical abuse in  childhood, non-acceptance of emotional responses, as well as paranoid,  borderline, and histrionic personality traits, were associated with an increased  risk of NSSI. These findings can help us make better use of artificial  intelligence technology to extract potential factors leading to NSSI in  adolescents from massive data, and provide theoretical support for the prevention  and intervention of NSSI in adolescents.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of an interactive robot on Turkish children's post-operative anxiety, mobilization, and parents' satisfaction related to  post-operative care. METHOD: A randomized controlled study was conducted with 84  children who will undergo day surgery aged 5-10 years and their parents at a  university hospital between June 2020-April 2022. The interactive robot was  provided to accompany the children during the postoperative mobilization.  Children in the control group received standard care during mobilization. Data  were collected using the Personal Information Form, Children's State Anxiety  (CSA), Parental Satisfaction Scale-Visual Analog Scale, and Mobilization Chart.  RESULTS: It was determined that the CSA score of the children in the control  group were higher than the intervention group before their first mobilization  after surgery (p = 0.005). During the first (p = 0.042) and second (p = 0.012)  mobilization, it was determined that the mobilization duration of children in the  intervention group was longer than the children in the control group. It was  found that the parents of the children in the intervention group had a high level  of satisfaction. CONCLUSION: It has been determined that interactive robots  positively affect postoperative mobilization in children undergoing day surgery,  reduce the anxiety level of children before mobilization, and increase the  duration of mobilization. In addition, the use of interactive robots increased  parents' satisfaction with post-operative mobilization care. PRACTICE  IMPLICATIONS: Using interactive robots to reduce the stress and anxiety of  children during the perioperative process can be a promising approach to improve  their recovery by providing early mobilization.

AB  - BACKGROUND: An easily accessible caries risk prediction model (CRPM) based on nonbiological predictors is lacking. Developing a CRPM for community screening is  essential for children's dental health promotion by a public health approach.  OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and validate a caries risk prediction  model (CRPM) for children using a machine learning algorithm based on dental care  behavioral factors and other nonbiological factors using a 3-month multicenter  cohort. METHODS: Children aged 12 months to 60 months were recruited at three  primary care settings and three kindergartens in Chengdu, China. Dental  examination was conducted for all enrolled children by calibrated pediatric  dentists at baseline and three months later. All parents of the enrolled children  were asked to complete a questionnaire with dental-related information. Machine  learning algorithms, including random forest, logistic regression, and adaptive  boosting, were used to develop a prediction model. Sensitivity, specificity,  accuracy, precision, negative predictive value and F-score were reported to  estimate the internal validation of the models. RESULTS: A total of 481 out of  745 children without a history of caries experience at baseline remained for  analysis. In the total sample population, 236 (49.1%) children were female, and  the mean age was 31.2 months. During the follow-up exams, 66 (13.6%) children had  new-onset caries. The child's age, height, weight, family caries status, brush  teeth two minutes per time, fluoride toothpaste usage, brushing twice per day,  parental monitoring brushing teeth, mother delivery method, brushing child's  teeth every day, child number counts, and night feeding frequency in the last  month were measured and included in a prediction model. Of the prediction models,  the highest area under the curve of RF was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.87- 0.94), followed by  0.86 (95% CI: 0.81-0.91) of LR and 0.81 (95% CI: 0.76-0.86) of AdaBoost.  CONCLUSION: In this CRPM, new onset of dental caries in three months among  children aged < 60 months could be predicted by answering twelve nonbiological  questions. A good model performance was shown within the internal validation.  Dental home care could be improved by referring the CRPM result before new caries  onset.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to describe the results collected with the Italian study conducted within eWare project, aimed at supporting the autonomy and health of  the older people affected by dementia and their informal caregivers, through the  use of an innovative system based on a social robot and a sensorized  environmental infrastructure. Nine dyads of older participants with their  caregivers were enrolled in testing the system for 6 months. The results show a  positive impact of the system in supporting the achievement of personal goals of  the participants, as well as in supporting the quality of life of the informal  caregivers. Nevertheless, the impact of the system in reducing the caregivers'  burden needs to be deeply investigated. This research highlights the potential of  the eWare system but modifications will have to be made, especially on the  interactivity capabilities, in order to meet the peculiar needs and wishes of  older people with dementia and to favor the long-term use of the system.

TI  - Deep Learning and 5G and Beyond for Child Drowning Prevention in Swimming Pools.
AU  - Cepeda-Pacheco, Juan Carlos

T2  - Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)
AB  - Drowning is a major health issue worldwide. The World Health Organization's global report on drowning states that the highest rates of drowning deaths occur  among children aged 1-4 years, followed by children aged 5-9 years. Young  children can drown silently in as little as 25 s, even in the shallow end or in a  baby pool. The report also identifies that the main risk factor for children  drowning is the lack of or inadequate supervision. Therefore, in this paper, we  propose a novel 5G and beyond child drowning prevention system based on deep  learning that detects and classifies distractions of inattentive parents or  caregivers and alerts them to focus on active child supervision in swimming  pools. In this proposal, we have generated our own dataset, which consists of  images of parents/caregivers watching the children or being distracted. The  proposed model can successfully perform a seven-class classification with very  high accuracies (98%, 94%, and 90% for each model, respectively). ResNet-50,  compared with the other models, performs better classifications for most classes.

AB  - Many studies have explored emotional and mental services that robots can provide for older adults, such as offering them daily conversation, news, music, or  health information. However, the ethical issues raised by using sensors for frail  older adults to monitor their daily movements or their medication intake, for  instance, are still being discussed. In this study, we develop an older  adult-guided, caregiver-monitored robot, Dori, which can detect and recognize  movement by sensing human poses in accordance with two factors from the  human-centered artificial intelligence (HCAI) framework. To design the care  robot's services based on sensing movement during daily activities, we conducted  focus group interviews with two groups-caregivers and medical staff-on the topic  of care robot services not for patients but for prefrail and frail elderly  individuals living at home. Based on their responses, we derived the focal  service areas of cognitive support, emotional support, physical activity support,  medication management, and caregiver management. We also found the two groups  differed in their ethical judgments in the areas of dignity, autonomy,  controllability, and privacy for services utilizing sensing by care robots.  Therefore, the pose recognition technology adopted in the present work uses only  joint coordinate information extracted from camera images and thus is  advantageous for protecting human dignity and personal information.

AB  - AIM: The purpose of this study is to investigate how the use of artificial intelligence is associated with the retention of elderly caregivers. BACKGROUND:  The turnover of elderly caregivers is high and increasing. Elderly care  institutions are beginning to use artificial intelligence to support caregivers  in their work, and the use of technology is critical to staff retention.  Empowerment of elderly caregivers has been neglected by managers and researchers.  METHODS: This cross-sectional study involved 511 elderly caregivers in 25 elderly  institutions. Six validated standardized scales were used for data collection,  and the software SPSS and SmartPLS were used for data analysis. RESULTS: The  quality of artificial intelligence has a significant positive effect on  empowerment. Artificial intelligence psychological empowerment (β = .355,  p < .001) and artificial intelligence structural empowerment (β = .375, p < .001)  both had positive effects on retention intention, and the jointly explained  variance (R(2) ) was 42.6%. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that a significant  relationship exists between artificial intelligence empowerment and retention  intention. Elderly caregivers with more structural empowerment have higher  retention intention. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Artificial intelligence  suppliers need to pay attention to the role of product quality in elderly care  services, continuously improve artificial intelligence quality, and strengthen  the application and routine maintenance of artificial intelligence technologies.  Elderly care institution managers should pay special attention to artificial  intelligence structural empowerment (such as artificial intelligence-related  education and training, learning and development opportunities, and resource  support).

AB  - We compare multiple machine learning algorithms and develop models to predict future hospitalization among Home- and Community-Based Services (HCBS) Users.  Furthermore, we calculate feature importance, the score of input variables based  on their importance to predict the outcome, to identify the most relevant  variables to predict hospitalization. We use the 2012 national Medicaid Analytic  eXtract data and Medicare Provider Analysis and Review data. Predicting any  hospitalization, Random Forest appears to be the most robust approach, though  XGBoost achieved similar predictive performance. While the importance of features  varies by algorithm, chronic conditions, previous hospitalizations, as well as  use of services for ambulance, personal care, and durable medical equipment were  generally found to be important predictors of hospitalization. Utilizing  prediction models to identify those who are prone to hospitalization could be  useful in developing early interventions to improve outcomes among HCBS users.

T2  - Advances in therapy
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) comprise a heterogeneous group of myeloid malignancies characterized by high symptom burden and limited treatment  options. A central challenge to caring for patients with MDS is assessing their  needs throughout the different phases of the disease. Patients and caregivers  frequently consult online sources to address informational and emotional support  needs. METHODS: We conducted a social listening analysis of publicly available  online forums to identify unmet needs of patients with MDS and their caregivers  in the USA, the UK, Spain, Canada, France, and China. We used artificial  intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) to group categories of  posts into seven overarching motivations for online engagement (Clinical,  Emotional, Treatments, Transplant, Education and Logistics, Physical, and Diet  and Lifestyle). RESULTS: Posts from the USA and China commonly discussed clinical  topics such as MDS diagnosis, disease monitoring, and progression. Posts from  Canada and France were frequently about treatments and treatment options.  Emotional concerns were key drivers of posts from Canada, Spain, and the UK.  Additionally, we also identified topics associated with negative language at key  phases during the treatment experience where patients and caregivers exhibited  increased online engagement, revealing educational and emotional support gaps at  the time of diagnosis, when patients are deciding between treatment options, and  when treatment options fail. CONCLUSION: In this research, based on social media  listening analyzed using AI and NLP, potential information gaps and unmet needs  among patients with MDS were identified. Addressing these gaps through targeted  patient education and guidance to emotional support options during these phases  could reduce the disease burden and emotional distress experienced by patients  with MDS.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Emerging evidence suggests that robotic devices for upper limb rehabilitation after a stroke may improve upper limb function. For robotic upper  limb rehabilitation in stroke to be successful, patients' experiences and those  of the rehabilitation professionals must be considered. Therefore, this review  aims to synthesise the available evidence on experiences of patients after a  stroke with rehabilitation robots for upper limb rehabilitation and the  experiences of rehabilitation professionals with rehabilitation robots for upper  limb stroke rehabilitation. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Database search will include  MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Elsevier), Cochrane CENTRAL, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of  Science, IEEE and CINAHL (EBSCOhost). Grey literature from Open Grey, PsyArXiv,  bioRxiv, medRxiv and Google Scholar will also be searched. Qualitative studies or  results from mixed-method studies that include adult patients after a stroke who  use upper limb rehabilitation robots, either supervised by rehabilitation  professionals or by patients themselves, at any stage of their rehabilitation  and/or stroke professionals who use upper limb rehabilitation robots will be  included. Robotic upper limb rehabilitation provided by students, healthcare  assistants, technicians, non-professional caregivers, family caregivers,  volunteer caregivers or other informal caregivers will be excluded. Articles  published in English will be considered regardless of date of publication.  Studies will be screened and critically appraised for methodological quality by  two independent reviewers. A standardised tool from JBI System for the Unified  Management, Assessment and Review of Information for data extraction, the  meta-aggregation approach for data synthesis and the ConQual approach for  confidence evaluation will be followed. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: As this  systematic review is based on previously published research, no informed consent  or ethical approval is required. It is anticipated that this systematic review  will highlight the experiences of patients after a stroke and perceived  facilitators and barriers for rehabilitation professionals on this topic, which  will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and national and  international conferences.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The need for caregiver respite is well-documented for the care of persons with IDD. Social Assistive Robotics (SAR) offer promise in addressing the  need for caregiver respite through 'complementary caregiving' activities that  promote engagement and learning opportunities for a care recipient (CR) with IDD.  This study explored the acceptability and usefulness of a SAR caregiver respite  program responsive to feedback from both young adults with IDD and their older  family caregivers (age 55+). METHOD: Young adults with IDD and caregiver dyads (N  = 11) were recruited. A mixed methods research design was deployed in three  phases: Phase I with four focus groups to inform the program design; Phase II for  program demonstration and evaluation with pre- and post-surveys; and Phase III  with post-program interviews for feedback and suggestions. RESULTS: Both young  adults with IDD and their caregivers scored favorably the social presence of,  social engagement, and satisfaction with robot Pepper. Though there was no  significant improvement of caregiving burden/stress as well as well-being of the  young adults with IDD based on surveys, results from interviews suggested that  the SAR may offer physical/emotional respite to caregivers by providing  companionship/friendship as well as promoting independence, safety/monitoring,  and interactive engagement with children. DISCUSSION: SAR has potential in  providing respite for older family caregivers. Future studies need a longer  program design and larger sample size to develop a promising intervention and  test its feasibility and efficacy.

AB  - Glucose management for people with type 2 diabetes mellitus is essential but challenging due to the multi-factored and chronic disease nature of diabetes. To  control glucose levels in a safe range and lessen abnormal glucose variability  efficiently and economically, an intelligent prediction of glucose is demanding.  A glucose trajectory prediction system based on subcutaneous interstitial  continuous glucose monitoring data and deep learning models for ensuing glucose  trajectory was constructed, followed by the application of personalised  prediction models on one participant with type 2 diabetes in a community. The  predictive accuracy was then assessed by RMSE (root mean square error) using  blood glucose data. Changes in glycaemic parameters of the participant before and  after model intervention were also compared to examine the efficacy of this  intelligence-aided health care. Individual Recurrent Neural Network model was  developed on glucose data, with an average daily RMSE of 1.59 mmol/L in the  application segment. In terms of the glucose variation, the mean glucose  decreased by 0.66 mmol/L, and HBGI dropped from 12.99 × 10(2) to 9.17 × 10(2).  However, the participant also had increased stress, especially in eating and  social support. Our research presented a personalised care system for people with  diabetes based on deep learning. The intelligence-aided health management system  is promising to enhance the outcome of diabetic patients, but further research is  also necessary to decrease stress in the intelligence-aided health management and  investigate the stress impacts on diabetic patients.

T2  - Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)
AB  - Sensory processing issues are one of the most common issues observed in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Technologies that could address the issue serve a more  and more important role in interventions for ASD individuals nowadays. In this  study, a sensory management recommendation system was developed and tested to  help ASD children deal with atypical sensory responses in class. The system  employed sensor fusion and machine learning techniques to identify distractions,  anxious situations, and the potential causes of these in the surroundings.  Another novelty of the system included a sensory management strategy making a  module based on fuzzy logic, which generated alerts to inform teachers and  caregivers about children's states and risky environmental factors. Sensory  management strategies were recommended to help improve children's attention or  calm children down. The evaluation results suggested that the use of the system  had a positive impact on children's performance and its design was user-friendly.  The sensory management recommendation system could work as an intelligent  companion for ASD children that helps with their in-class performance by  recommending management strategies in relation to the real-time information about  the children's environment.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To understand the current situation of professional identity and life significance of clinical medical freshmen in a university in Xinjiang, analyze  its influencing factors, find out the influencing factors and causes, and  intervene and improve them. Provide the public with better medical and health  management services, so that people can independently and effectively predict and  prevent diseases; at the same time, it can also guide people to make more correct  and wise choices in uncomfortable situations. METHODS: A questionnaire survey was  conducted on 793 freshmen majoring in clinical medicine with the college  students' professional identity questionnaire and the Chinese version of the  meaning in life scale (C-MLQ). RESULTS: The freshmen total score of professional  identity was (97.48 ± 12.21). The total score of meaning in life was  (53.26 ± 7.15), and the meaning in life and the professional identity were  significantly positively correlated (r = 0.467, P < 0.01). Students with first  choice, only child, urban living, and parents with a high educational level  scored higher in their professional identity (P < 0.05). First choice (β = -0.11,  P < 0.001), place of residence (β = -0.07, P=0.03), father's education level  (β = 0.08, P=0.04), family monthly income (β = -0.09, P=0.02), and the presence  of meaning in life (β = 0.54, P < 0.001) are the influencing factors of students'  professional identity. Both professional identity and meaning in life have  important relationship with the mental health of medical students. In the  development of modern medicine, finding personal career orientation and goals  helps to establish a correct outlook on life, values, and the world. It has a  positive impact on the development of personal physical and mental health.  CONCLUSION: The professional identity and life meaning of clinical medical  freshmen are at the upper middle level, which can be improved through medical  education and other measures. The joint efforts of society, schools, families,  and individual students are needed to improve the professional identity of  medical students.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The article addresses commercial socially assistive robots (SAR). There is evidence of the impact of SAR on older persons in institutional  settings. Family care at home has not yet been the subject of systematic  research; however, especially at home SAR could help to prevent loneliness,  provide emotional support, and foster communication. OBJECTIVE: Inspired by  evidence on the potential impact of SAR, the article analyzes their potential for  supporting family care at home. A participatory research and development (R&D)  project stands as an example of how SAR can improve communication and relations  at home. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Apart from the results of selected randomized  controlled trials (RCT) in institutional settings, the article provides results  from tests that were run in the R&D project. RESULTS: SAR can increase the  quality of life of users at home. They are capable of improving relations within  family care. They inspire communication, change routines, and provide relief to  family caregivers; however, it takes trained human companions to support the use  of SAR at home and address ethical aspects. CONCLUSION: If SAR are supposed to  deliver their potential for care at home, older persons and their caregivers must  be actively involved in research and development. These processes must be  systematically evaluated.

AB  - AIM: This pilot study aimed to explore the impact of Smart Home technology to support older people's quality of life, particularly for those who live alone.  BACKGROUND: There has been an increased interest in using innovative technologies  and artificial intelligence to enable Smart Home technology to support older  people to age independently in their own homes. METHODS: This study used a  pre-and post-test design. The seven item Personal Wellbeing Index was used to  measure participants' subjective quality of life across seven quality of life  domains. Participants (n = 60) aged between 68 and 90 years (M = 80.10,  SD = 5.56) completed a 12-week personalised Smart Home technology program.  RESULTS: Approximately half of the participants lived alone (48.3%).  Participants' quality of life significantly increased (p = 0.010) after Smart  Home use. Two domains, "achieving in life" (p = 0.026) and "future security"  (p = 0.004), were also significantly improved after participating in the Smart  Home technology program. Improvements in quality of life did not vary as a  function of living arrangement (all ps > .152, all ηp2  > .00). CONCLUSION: The  current study provides preliminary evidence for the role of Smart Home technology  in supporting older people's quality of life, particularly their sense of  achieving in life and future security.

AB  - We applied machine learning algorithms to examine the relationship between demographics and outcomes of the social work services used by Hispanic family  caregivers of persons with dementia recruited for a clinical trial in New York  City. The social work service needs were largely concentrated on instrumental  support to gain access to the healthcare system rather than other concrete  services (e.g., housing or food programs) or to address psychological needs among  the caregivers with relatively higher income. A finding from the machine learning  approach was that among those who receive medical-related social work services,  frequent users (≥10 times) with high family friend support(>4) were more likely  than frequent users without such support to have their issues resolved (Accuracy:  81.9%, AUC: 0.82, F-measure: 0.86 by J48). Even though half of the participants  received social work services multiple times, the needs of the caregivers  remained unmet unless they sought social work services frequently (more than ten  times).

AB  - Earlier studies show frail seniors often experience loneliness and depression. Moreover, frailty can lead problems with medication and nutrition patterns. The  availability of family care and/or nursing care at home is limited. Digital  companions, such as social robots, could complement homecare nurses, thereby  improving the quality of care to frail seniors. The Guardian project has co-  designed with end-users, a social robot providing social company and health  support. To assess the digital and co-created solution, usability evaluations  have been conducted with 43 participants distributed as fairly as possible  between frail seniors, family carers and professional nurses; in three different  European areas: The Netherlands, Italy and Switzerland. The goal of this study is  to evaluate if the GUARDIAN solution is accepted by the target users and also  gather data on how to improve the system for ensuring added-value in home care.  The iterative method based on user-centered approach put the end-users at the  centre of the usability evaluation. Through thematic analysis of the qualitative  datasets, we conclude that a high number of users accept the solution and  describe it as useful. End-user needs have been mainly addressed but some new  improvements have been pointed out by the participants and some other needs have  been uncovered.

AB  - We randomly extracted Korean-language Tweets mentioning dementia/Alzheimer's disease (n= 12,413) from November 28 to December 9, 2020. We independently  applied three machine learning algorithms (Afinn, Syuzhet, and Bing) using  natural language processing (NLP) techniques and qualitative manual scoring to  assign emotional valence scores to Tweets. We then compared the means and  distributions of the four emotional valence scores. Visual examination of the  graphs produced indicated that each method exhibited unique patterns. The  aggregated mean emotional valence scores from the NLP methods were mostly  neutral, vs. slightly negative for manual coding (Afinn 0.029, 95% CI [-0.019,  0.077]; Syuzhet 0.266, [0.236, 0.295]; Bing -0.271, [-0.289, -0.252]; manual  coding -1.601, [-1.632, -1.569]). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed no  statistically significant differences among the four means after normalization.  These findings suggest that the application of NLP can be fairly effective in  extracting emotional valence scores from Korean-language Twitter content to gain  insights regarding family caregiving for a person with dementia.

AB  - Autism, also known as pervasive developmental disorder or autism spectrum disorder, is a group of clinical syndromes of developmental delay or impairment.  Social impairment, verbal communication impairment, and behavioral impairment are  the three conditions for the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, according to  the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual.  According to relevant statistics, about 1 in 100 children is now diagnosed with  autism, and their rehabilitation treatment is also valued by people from all  walks of life. In the rehabilitation training of autistic children, it is found  that the rehabilitation training of autistic children should pay attention to the  role of parents and family environment. It is crucial that parents receive  systematic training and act as partners in the development of the intervention  plan. Research shows that a specific structured education and skills training  program for parents of children with autism can be beneficial in improving  behavioral problems, functional communication, and symptoms of autism in children  with autism. To this end, this paper has completed the following work: Secondly,  a portion of the systematic training of CA parents is discussed, followed by an  explanation of the structure and principles of BPNN. Finally, the BPNN is  utilized to create a model for assessing the impact of systematic parent  instruction on CA. The experimental findings suggest that the proposed BPNN  outperforms the competition.

AB  - Dementia and other related diseases causing symptoms of mild cognitive impairment are being increasingly diagnosed. These diseases are placing a significant strain  on the healthcare system. Robotic technology research has also been increasing,  specifically in the field of healthcare and assisted living. This scoping review  explores the research at the intersection of dementia and robotic devices. More  specifically, this paper looks at how robots can be used in dementia care to gain  a deeper understanding of the potential benefits this technology may have on  patient and caregiver lives. This research was conducted using PRISMA guidelines.  Data were extracted from 13 articles. The researchers found that there is a lack  of evidence regarding how robotics can assist patients living with dementia;  however, robotic devices can be used by patients to perform some daily tasks in  the home.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with heart failure (HF) who actively engage in their own self-management have better outcomes. Extracting data through natural language  processing (NLP) holds great promise for identifying patients with or at risk of  poor self-management. OBJECTIVE: To identify home health care (HHC) patients with  HF who have poor self-management using NLP of narrative notes, and to examine  patient factors associated with poor self-management. METHODS: An NLP algorithm  was applied to extract poor self-management documentation using 353,718 HHC  narrative notes of 9,710 patients with HF. Sociodemographic and structured  clinical data were incorporated into multivariate logistic regression models to  identify factors associated with poor self-management. RESULTS: There were 758  (7.8%) patients in this sample identified as having notes with language  describing poor HF self-management. Younger age (OR 0.982, 95% CI 0.976-0.987,  p < .001), longer length of stay in HHC (OR 1.036, 95% CI 1.029- 1.043,  p < .001), diagnosis of diabetes (OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.3-1.67, p < .001) and  depression (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.09-1.68, p < .01), impaired decision-making (OR  1.64, 95% CI 1.37-1.95, p < .001), smoking (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.4-2.04, p < .001),  and shortness of breath with exertion (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.1-1.42, p < .01) were  associated with poor self-management. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with HF who have poor  self-management can be identified from the narrative notes in HHC using novel NLP  methods. Meaningful information about the self-management of patients with HF can  support HHC clinicians in developing individualized care plans to improve  self-management and clinical outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to increasing age and an increasing prevalence rate of neurocognitive disorders such as Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and dementia,  independent living may become challenging. The use of socially assistive robots  (SARs) is one solution that can enable older adults with cognitive impairment to  remain independent. However, at present, there is a lack of knowledge about the  attitudes of older adults with MCI and their caregivers towards SARs. METHODS:  This study relies on a constructivist grounded theory approach. Semi-structured  interviews were conducted to gain a deeper insight into attitudes of two  different stakeholder groups; older adults with MCI and their (in)formal  caregivers. RESULTS: Forty individual semi-structured interviews were conducted  with older adults with MCI (N = 30) and (in)formal caregivers (N = 10). Data  revealed different perspectives on SARs in healthcare for the involved  stakeholders. Two main topics could be derived: (1) perspectives on robot  assistance, discussing different viewpoints on the potential value of robots as  helpers, and (2) perspectives on implementation, revealing different factors that  could affect implementation. Both topics may explain a positive, impartial or  negative attitude towards SARs. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified different  factors that should be taken into account when implementing a SAR in the home  environment of older adults. Despite the fact that the benefits of SARs are often  recognized, many older participants currently seem not ready yet to commit to the  use of a SAR.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONThis study explores the attitudes  towards a SAR, developed to stimulate and support older adults with Mild  Cognitive Impairment (MCI) on a physical, cognitive and social level.The results  give a deeper insight into different factors contributing to a (non-) successful  implementation of SARs in the home environment of older adults with MCI.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Family engagement is critical in the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI)-based clinical decision support tools, which will play an  increasing role in health care in the future. We sought to understand parental  perceptions of computer-assisted health care of children in the emergency  department (ED). METHODS: We conducted a population-weighted household panel  survey of parents with minor children in their home in a large US city to  evaluate perceptions of the use of computer programs for the care of children  with respiratory illness. We identified demographics associated with discomfort  with AI using survey-weighted logistic regression. RESULTS: Surveys were  completed by 1620 parents (panel response rate = 49.7%). Most respondents were  comfortable with the use of computer programs to determine the need for  antibiotics (77.6%) or bloodwork (76.5%), and to interpret radiographs (77.5%).  In multivariable analysis, Black non-Hispanic parents reported greater discomfort  with AI relative to White non-Hispanic parents (odds ratio [OR] 1.67, 95%  confidence interval [CI] 1.03-2.70) as did younger parents (18-25 years) relative  to parents ≥46 years (OR 2.48, 95% CI 1.31-4.67). The greatest perceived benefits  of computer programs were finding something a human would miss (64.2%, 95% CI  60.9%-67.4%) and obtaining a more rapid diagnosis (59.6%; 56.2%-62.9%). Areas of  greatest concern were diagnostic errors (63.0%, 95% CI 59.6%-66.4%), and  recommending incorrect treatment (58.9%, 95% CI 55.5%-62.3%). CONCLUSIONS:  Parents were generally receptive to computer-assisted management of children with  respiratory illnesses in the ED, though reservations emerged. Black non-Hispanic  and younger parents were more likely to express discomfort about AI.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Adequate support in maternity wards is decisive for breastfeeding outcomes during the first year of life. Quality improvement  interventions require the identification of the factors influencing hospital  benchmark indicators. Machine Learning (ML) models and post-hoc Explainable  Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques allow accurate predictions and  explaining them. This study aimed to predict exclusive breastfeeding during the  in-hospital postpartum stay by ML algorithms and explain the ML model's behaviour  to support decision making. METHODS: The dataset included 2042 mothers giving  birth in 18 hospitals in Eastern Spain. We obtained information on demographics,  mothers' breastfeeding experiences, clinical variables, and participating  hospitals' support conditions. The outcome variable was exclusive breastfeeding  during the in-hospital postpartum stay. We tested algorithms from different ML  families. To evaluate the ML models, we applied 10-fold stratified  cross-validation. We used the following metrics: Area under curve receiver  operating characteristic (ROC AUC), area under curve precision-recall (PR AUC),  accuracy, and Brier score. After selecting the best fitting model, we calculated  Shapley's additive values to assign weights to each predictor depending on its  additive contribution to the outcome and to explain the predictions. RESULTS: The  XGBoost algorithms showed the best metrics (ROC AUC = 0.78, PR AUC = 0.86,  accuracy = 0.75, Brier = 0.17). The main predictors of the model included, in  order of importance, the pacifier use, the degree of breastfeeding self-efficacy,  the previous breastfeeding experience, the birth weight, the admission of the  baby to a neonatal care unit after birth, the moment of the first skin-to-skin  contact between mother and baby, and the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative  accreditation of the hospital. Specific examples for linear and nonlinear  relations between main predictors and the outcome and heterogeneity of effects  are presented. Also, we describe diverse individual cases showing the variation  of the prediction depending on individual characteristics. CONCLUSION: The ML  model adequately predicted exclusive breastfeeding during the in-hospital stay.  Our results pointed to opportunities for improving care related to support for  specific mother's groups, defined by current and previous infant feeding  experiences and clinical conditions of the newborns, and the participating  hospitals' support conditions. Also, XAI techniques allowed identifying  non-linearity relations and effect's heterogeneity, explaining specific cases'  risk variations.

T2  - Journal of biomedical informatics
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop an effective Management Information System (MIS) that is empowered by predictive models that can forecast the demand of end-stage cancer  home hospitalized patients in individual and population levels, and help  palliative care service systems operate smoothly where the demand is highly  fluctuating, resources are limited, expensive, and hardly adjustable in a short  time, and the backlog and shortage costs are high. METHOD: Inspired by real  problems faced by a palliative care center providing various medical, nursing,  psychological, and social services in a home-based setting, two Long Short-Term  Memory (LSTM) based deep learning models are proposed for demand forecasting at  both individual and population levels. The individual-level model can predict the  type and time of the next service required for a specific patient with a given  demographic and health profile, and the population-level model helps with the  prediction of next week's demand for various services in a center supporting a  specific patient population. Predicted demand informs on optimal resource and  operations plan through a well designed MIS. RESULTS: Experiments were conducted  on a dataset consisting of more than 4000 cancer patients with a Palliative  Performance Scale (PPS) of 40 and below discharged from hospital to home under a  national palliative care center's home hospitalization service in Iran from  September 2012 to July 2019. The models outperformed conventional time-series  forecasting methods where applicable. Results indicate that the proposed models  were capable of forecasting patients' demand with astonishing performances both  individually and on larger scales. CONCLUSION: Intelligent demand forecasting can  help palliative care home hospitalization systems to overcome the challenge of  progressive demand growth when a considerable portion of patients are approaching  death, followed by a sudden drop in demand when those patients pass away. It  helps to improve resource utilization and quality of care concurrently.

AB  - This research paper elucidates the clinical effect of an integrated nursing model of medical care and patient in the diagnosis and treatment of congenital  esophageal atresia (CEA). For this purpose, a total of 120 children with CEA were  selected as study subjects who were admitted to our hospital (January 2017 to  April 2020). They were randomly divided into the control group and observation  group. Each group had 60 cases. The control group was given routine nursing,  while the observation group adopted the integrated nursing model of medical care.  The integrated nursing model had the characteristics of recognizing and managing  the CEA quickly and efficiently. Thus, it can help increase the survival rate of  infants. This model works along with the parents to provide specialized services  to the child. They were tasked to carefully observe the infants as well as calm  the parents. They were also given the additional task of keeping track of  patients who were currently admitted in the hospital and those who were already  discharged. The tracking and communication were done with the help of a  communication platform which is WeChat. The rehospitalization rate, 1-hour visit  rate, accuracy rate of children with suspected postoperative complications,  psychological status of children's parents, medical compliance, and satisfaction  were compared between the two groups. The rehospitalization rate in the  observation group was lower than that in the control group (P < 0.05). The 1-hour  visit rate and accuracy of children with suspected postoperative complications in  the observation group were higher than those in the control group (P < 0.05). The  anxiety and depression scores of the parents in the observation group were lower  than those in the control group (P < 0.05). The compliance and satisfaction of  parents in the observation group were higher than those in the control group (P <  0.05). The clinical effect of the integrated nursing model of medical care and  patient in CEA was highly satisfactory. It reduces the rehospitalization rate and  enables timely diagnosis and treatment of suspicious complications effectively.  It also improved parents' negative psychological emotions, compliance, and  satisfaction.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the effect of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) under the fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering algorithm on plan-do-check-action  (PDCA) home nursing for patients with diabetic nephropathy (DN). As the  characteristics of fMRI image data were combined, the FCM algorithm was improved  and applied into the clustering processing of fMRI activation regions of  patients. 64 patients with DN were chosen as the research objects and were  divided into the research group with PDCA home nursing and the control group with  routine home nursing. The patients were randomly divided into the research group  (n = 32) and the control group (n = 32). The curative effect, nursing  satisfaction, and quality of life of patients after nursing were compared. The  results showed that the coverage of fMRI activation points was significantly  higher as being detected by the FCM algorithm, and the running time was shortened  by 33.6 min. After nursing, the total effective rates in the research group and  the control group were 87.5% vs. 34.4% in 3 months, 93.8% vs. 68.8% in 6 months,  and 96.9% vs. 75.0% in 12 months, respectively; those in the research group were  significantly higher than those in the control group (P < 0.05). The nursing  satisfaction score (91.3 ± 4.5 vs. 80.9 ± 5.2) and nursing service quality score  (89.7 ± 6.6 vs. 80.3 ± 7.1) in the research group were also significantly higher  than those in the control group (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, the scores of each item  after nursing in the research group were significantly higher than those in the  control group (P < 0.05). The improved FCM algorithm detected the activation  regions in the fMRI images more effectively, which could provide help for  diagnosis and reduce error and misdiagnosis. At the same time, the PDCA home  nursing also offered great help to the recovery of patients with DN, which was  more superior for the curative effect of hospitalization, the promotion of  recovery, and the improvement of patients' quality of life.

AB  - The long-term use of transfer support robots in nursing facilities is an important option for improving the efficiency of care work. The "Resyone"  transfer support robot is a combination of an electric care bed and a wheelchair,  and the wheelchair half of the bed can be detached at the touch of a button. The  purpose of this study was to investigate how the long-term use of Resyone would  improve the performance of transfer assists, such as reducing the need for  multiple caregivers. One Resyone was installed in a nursing facility in Japan and  17 caregivers used it for more than 11 months. The time and number of caregivers  required for each transfer assist were surveyed for three 1-week periods: 1 week  before (Phase 1) and at 3 weeks (Phase 2) and 11 months (Phase 3) after the  introduction of Resyone. In Phase 1, approximately 60% of all transfer assists  were performed by two caregivers, but in Phase 2, this was reduced to  approximately 20%, and finally, in Phase 3, all transfer assists were performed  by a single caregiver. These results suggested that the long-term use of Resyone  was associated with improved work efficiency in transfer assistance in a nursing  facility.

TI  - Ethical Design and Use of Robotic Care of the Elderly.
AU  - Johnston, Carolyn
T2  - Journal of bioethical inquiry
AB  - The Australian Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety acknowledged understaffing and substandard care in residential aged care and home care  services, and recommendations were made that that the Australian Government  should promote assistive technology within aged care. Robotic care assistants can  provide care and companionship for the elderly-both in their own homes and within  health and aged care institutions. Although more research is required into their  use, studies indicate benefits, including enabling the elderly to live  independently at home, assistance with medication and monitoring of safety.  Nevertheless, there are inherent ethical challenges in the use of robots as  carers, including loss of privacy, unwarranted restrictions on autonomy, lack of  dignity, deception, and the exacerbation of loneliness. Ethics by design can  counter these issues in development of robotics and clinical ethics committees  have been put forward as a way of dealing with the ethical use of robotic care in  healthcare institutions. In this paper I outline the ethical challenges of  robotic care assistants and how these may be mediated in their design and use.

AB  - With the increasingly serious population aging, economic system transformation, and social transformation, the elderly have an increasingly strong demand for the  elderly care service industry, but the development of China's elderly care  service industry started late, and there are still many problems. For how to  build a better elderly care service model, under the current situation of  shortage of elderly care resources, community elderly care may become a solution.  By analyzing the status quo, existing problems and development trends of  home-based care services in Hangzhou's community, and learning from foreign  experience, it explores the establishment of a "integrated physical, medical, and  nursing care" community health management model for the elderly and provides a  perfect solution for the development of Hangzhou's community elderly care  services countermeasures and suggestions for mode operation. Based on the  evaluation, problem analysis, and empirical research on the current situation of  home care services in Hangzhou communities, this paper draws on relatively mature  community care practices, proposes to build a community elderly health management  model that combines medical care and care, and improves and innovates the overall  design and medical care of the elderly service model measures for the health  management of the elderly in the integrated community. The experimental results  of this study show that, according to the demand for elderly care services,  elderly people in need of care account for 86.6%, 79.5%, and 68.4% of the elderly  population, especially in the areas of medical care, life care, and housekeeping  services.

AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Between 10 and 25% patients are hospitalized or visit emergency department (ED) during home healthcare (HHC). Given that up to 40% of  these negative clinical outcomes are preventable, early and accurate prediction  of hospitalization risk can be one strategy to prevent them. In recent years,  machine learning-based predictive modeling has become widely used for building  risk models. This study aimed to compare the predictive performance of four risk  models built with various data sources for hospitalization and ED visits in HHC.  METHODS: Four risk models were built using different variables from two data  sources: structured data (i.e., Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS)  and other assessment items from the electronic health record (EHR)) and  unstructured narrative-free text clinical notes for patients who received HHC  services from the largest non-profit HHC organization in New York between 2015  and 2017. Then, five machine learning algorithms (logistic regression, Random  Forest, Bayesian network, support vector machine (SVM), and Naïve Bayes) were  used on each risk model. Risk model performance was evaluated using the F-score  and Precision-Recall Curve (PRC) area metrics. RESULTS: During the study period,  8373/86,823 (9.6%) HHC episodes resulted in hospitalization or ED visits. Among  five machine learning algorithms on each model, the SVM showed the highest  F-score (0.82), while the Random Forest showed the highest PRC area (0.864).  Adding information extracted from clinical notes significantly improved the risk  prediction ability by up to 16.6% in F-score and 17.8% in PRC. CONCLUSION: All  models showed relatively good hospitalization or ED visit risk predictive  performance in HHC. Information from clinical notes integrated with the  structured data improved the ability to identify patients at risk for these  emergent care events.

AB  - The UK Dermatology Clinical Trials Network (UK DCTN) was formed in 2002 with the aim of developing and supporting high-quality independent national clinical  trials that address prioritized research questions for people with skin disease.  Its philosophy is to democratize UK dermatological clinical research and to  tackle important clinical questions that industry has no incentive to answer. The  network also plays a key role in training and capacity development. Its  membership of over 1000 individuals includes dermatology consultants, trainees,  dermatology nurses, general practitioners, methodologists and patients. Its  organizational structures are lean and include a co-ordinating team based at the  Centre of Evidence-Based Dermatology in Nottingham, and an executive with  independent members to ensure probity and business progression. A prioritization  panel and steering group enable a pipeline of projects to be prioritized and  refined for external funding from independent sources. The UK DCTN has supported  and completed 12 national clinical trials, attracting investment of over £15  million into UK clinical dermatology research. Trials have covered a range of  interventions from drugs such as doxycycline (BLISTER), silk clothing for eczema  (CLOTHES) and surgical interventions for hidradenitis suppurativa (THESEUS).  Trial results are published in prestigious journals and have global impact.  Genuine partnership with patients and carers has been a strong feature of the  network since its inception. The UK DCTN is proud of its first 20 years of  collaborative work, and aims to remain at the forefront of independent  dermatological health technology assessment, as well as expanding into areas  including diagnostics, artificial intelligence, efficient studies and innovative  designs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: About one in five patients receiving home healthcare (HHC) services are hospitalized or visit an emergency department (ED) during a home care  episode. Early identification of at-risk patients can prevent these negative  outcomes. However, risk indicators, including language in clinical notes that  indicate a concern about a patient, are often hidden in narrative documentation  throughout their HHC episode. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to develop an  automated natural language processing (NLP) algorithm to identify concerning  language indicative of HHC patients' risk of hospitalizations or ED visits.  METHODS: This study used the Omaha System-a standardized nursing terminology that  describes problems/signs/symptoms that can occur in the community setting. First,  five HHC experts iteratively reviewed the Omaha System and identified concerning  concepts indicative of HHC patients' risk of hospitalizations or ED visits. Next,  we developed and tested an NLP algorithm to identify these concerning concepts in  HHC clinical notes automatically. The resulting NLP algorithm was applied on a  large subset of narrative notes (2.3 million notes) documented for 66,317 unique  patients ( n = 87,966 HHC episodes) admitted to one large HHC agency in the  Northeast United States between 2015 and 2017. RESULTS: A total of 160 Omaha  System signs/symptoms were identified as concerning concepts for hospitalizations  or ED visits in HHC. These signs/symptoms belong to 31 of the 42 available Omaha  System problems. Overall, the NLP algorithm showed good performance in  identifying concerning concepts in clinical notes. More than 18% of clinical  notes were detected as having at least one concerning concept, and more than 90%  of HHC episodes included at least one Omaha System problem. The most frequently  documented concerning concepts were pain, followed by issues related to  neuromusculoskeletal function, circulation, mental health, and  communicable/infectious conditions. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that  concerning problems or symptoms that could increase the risk of hospitalization  or ED visit were frequently documented in narrative clinical notes. NLP can  automatically extract information from narrative clinical notes to improve our  understanding of care needs in HHC. Next steps are to evaluate which concerning  concepts identified in clinical notes predict hospitalization or ED visit.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Frail elderly are at high risk of hospitalizations and have a complex pattern of risk factors that makes it hard to foresee potential needs for  additional treatment and care. Machine learning algorithms are potentially  well-suited to discover hidden patterns in registrations that are routinely made  across sectors. OBJECTIVE: To investigate predictors and performance of machine  learning algorithms designed to predict acute hospitalizations in elderly  recipients of home care services. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A development study  based on a retrospective social sector cohort with 1,282 participants was  designed. Included subjects were aged 65 or older and received home care services  in Aalborg Municipality at least once a week from 1/1-2016 to 31/12-2017. Data  were collected from a newly developed triage tool in combination with  administrative and clinical data routinely collected in the Danish healthcare and  social care sector. 857 predictors were tested and evaluated based on the area  under the precision-recall curve (PR-AUC). The data was divided into a 70/30  training and test split with 5-fold cross-validation. A sliding window approach  combining random under-sampling with a boosting algorithm (RUSBoost) was applied  with a standard logistic regression included for comparison. RESULTS: The  logistic regression achieved a PR-AUC of 0.01 (CI 0.00; 0.01) while the PR-AUC  was 0.71 (CI 0.56; 0.76) for the RUSBoost algorithm. Four of the five most  important citizen-level features used to accurately predict an acute  hospitalization was the total number of services provided by the municipality to  the citizen, the number of personal care registrations as well as number of  medication handlings and nutritional registrations. A final important predictor  was the number of physical complaints derived from the triage tool. CONCLUSIONS:  Municipalities routinely collect valuable administrative and clinical data that  can be used for early prediction of acute hospitalizations. However, future  studies are needed to validate the results.

TI  - Ethical considerations in design and implementation of home-based smart care for dementia.
AU  - Hine, Christine
AU  - Nilforooshan, Ramin
AU  - Barnaghi, Payam
T2  - Nursing ethics
AB  - It has now become a realistic prospect for smart care to be provided at home for those living with long-term conditions such as dementia. In the contemporary  smart care scenario, homes are fitted with an array of sensors for remote  monitoring providing data that feed into intelligent systems developed to  highlight concerning patterns of behaviour or physiological measurements and to  alert healthcare professionals to the need for action. This paper explores some  ethical issues that may arise within such smart care systems, focusing on the  extent to which ethical issues can be addressed at the system design stage.  Artificial intelligence has been widely portrayed as an ethically risky  technology, posing challenges for privacy and human autonomy and with the  potential to introduce and exacerbate bias and inequality. While broad principles  for ethical artificial intelligence have become established, the mechanisms for  governing ethical artificial intelligence are still evolving. In healthcare  settings the implementation of smart technologies falls within the existing  frameworks for ethical review and governance. Feeding into this ethical review  there are many practical steps that designers can take to build ethical  considerations into the technology. After exploring the pre-emptive steps that  can be taken in design and governance to provide for an ethical smart care  system, the paper reviews the potential for further ethical challenges to arise  within the everyday implementation of smart care systems in the context of  dementia, despite the best efforts of all concerned to pre-empt them. The paper  concludes with an exploration of the dilemmas that may thus face healthcare  professionals involved in implementing this kind of smart care and with a call  for further research to explore ethical dimensions of smart care both in terms of  general principles and lived experience.

AB  - Dementia and other related diseases are becoming increasingly diagnosed and are placing a serious strain on the healthcare system. Robotic technology research is  currently underway to provide the much needed support to patients, caregivers,  and health providers. This includes examining the ethical implications of robots  use in healthcare. This scoping review explores the current state of the  literature regarding robotics and dementia with a special lens on ethics. More  specifically, this paper strives to gain an understanding of the current ethical  considerations, and propose an intervention for evaluating ethical considerations  prior to implementation. This research was conducted using PRISMA guidelines,  extracting data from articles. Our findings revealed that further attention to  policies and guidelines that are currently in place for general use of the  technology should be utilized, and applied specifically to the context where the  technology will be used.

AB  - We extracted 3,291,101 Tweets using hashtags associated with African American-related discourse (#BlackTwitter, #BlackLivesMatter, #StayWoke) and  1,382,441 Tweets from a control set (general or no hashtags) from September 1,  2019 to December 31, 2019 using the Twitter API. We also extracted a literary  historical corpus of 14,692 poems and prose writings by African American authors  and 66,083 items authored by others as a control, including poems, plays, short  stories, novels and essays, using a cloud-based machine learning platform (Amazon  SageMaker) via ProQuest TDM Studio. Lastly, we combined statistics from log  likelihood and Fisher's exact tests as well as feature analysis of a  batch-trained Naive Bayes classifier to select lexicons of terms most strongly  associated with the target or control texts. The resulting Tweet-derived African  American lexicon contains 1,734 unigrams, while the control contains 2,266  unigrams. This initial version of a lexicon-based African American Tweet  detection algorithm developed using Tweet texts will be useful to inform  culturally sensitive Twitter-based social support interventions for African  American dementia caregivers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent years, robotic rehabilitation devices have often been used for motor training. However, to date, no systematic reviews of qualitative  studies exploring the end-user experiences of robotic devices in motor  rehabilitation have been published. The aim of this study was to review  end-users' (patients, carers and healthcare professionals) experiences with  robotic devices in motor rehabilitation, by conducting a systematic review and  thematic meta-synthesis of qualitative studies concerning the users' experiences  with such robotic devices. METHODS: Qualitative studies and mixed-methods studies  with a qualitative element were eligible for inclusion. Nine electronic databases  were searched from inception to August 2020, supplemented with internet searches  and forward and backward citation tracking from the included studies and review  articles. Data were synthesised thematically following the Thomas and Harden  approach. The CASP Qualitative Checklist was used to assess the quality of the  included studies of this review. RESULTS: The search strategy identified a total  of 13,556 citations and after removing duplicates and excluding citations based  on title and abstract, and full text screening, 30 studies were included. All  studies were considered of acceptable quality. We developed six analytical  themes: logistic barriers; technological challenges; appeal and engagement;  supportive interactions and relationships; benefits for physical, psychological,  and social function(ing); and expanding and sustaining therapeutic options.  CONCLUSIONS: Despite experiencing technological and logistic challenges,  participants found robotic devices acceptable, useful and beneficial (physically,  psychologically, and socially), as well as fun and interesting. Having supportive  relationships with significant others and positive therapeutic relationships with  healthcare staff were considered the foundation for successful rehabilitation and  recovery.

AB  - The goal of this natural language processing (NLP) study was to identify patients in home healthcare with heart failure symptoms and poor self-management (SM). The  preliminary lists of symptoms and poor SM status were identified, NLP algorithms  were used to refine the lists, and NLP performance was evaluated using 2.3  million home healthcare clinical notes. The overall precision to identify  patients with heart failure symptoms and poor SM status was 0.86. The feasibility  of methods was demonstrated to identify patients with heart failure symptoms and  poor SM documented in home healthcare notes. This study facilitates utilizing key  symptom information and patients' SM status from unstructured data in electronic  health records. The results of this study can be applied to better individualize  symptom management to support heart failure patients' quality-of-life.

AB  - The Center for Eldercare and Rehabilitation Technology, at University of Missouri, has researched the use of smart, unobtrusive sensors for older adult  residents' health monitoring and alerting in aging-in-place communities for many  years. Sensors placed in the apartments of older adult residents generate a  deluge of daily data that is automatically aggregated, analyzed, and summarized  to aid in health awareness, clinical care, and research for healthy aging. When  anomalies or concerning trends are detected within the data, the sensor  information is converted into linguistic health messages using fuzzy  computational techniques, so as to make it understandable to the clinicians.  Sensor data are analyzed at the individual level, therefore, through this study  we aim to discover various combinations of patterns of anomalies happening  together and recurrently in the older adult's population using these text  summaries. Leveraging various computational text data processing techniques, we  are able to extract relevant analytical features from the health messages. These  features are transformed into a transactional encoding, then processed with  frequent pattern mining techniques for association rule discovery. At individual  level analysis, resident ID 3027 was considered as an exemplar to describe the  analysis. Seven combinations of anomalies/rules/associations were discovered in  this resident, out of which rule group three showed an increased recurrence  during the COVID lockdown of facility. At the population level, a total of 38  associations were discovered that highlight the health patterns, and we continue  to explore the health conditions associated with them. Ultimately, our goal is to  correlate the combinations of anomalies with certain health conditions, which can  then be leveraged for predictive analytics and preventative care. This will  improve the current clinical care systems for older adult residents in smart  sensor, aging-in-place communities.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Interest in digital technologies in the health care sector is growing and can be a way to reduce the burden on professional caregivers while helping  people to become more independent. Social robots are regarded as a special form  of technology that can be usefully applied in professional caregiving with the  potential to focus on interpersonal contact. While implementation is progressing  slowly, a debate on the concepts and applications of social robots in future care  is necessary. OBJECTIVE: In addition to existing studies with a focus on societal  attitudes toward social robots, there is a need to understand the views of  professional caregivers and patients. This study used desired future scenarios to  collate the perspectives of experts and analyze the significance for developing  the place of social robots in care. METHODS: In February 2020, an expert workshop  was held with 88 participants (health professionals and educators; [PhD] students  of medicine, health care, professional care, and technology; patient advocates;  software developers; government representatives; and research fellows) from  Austria, Germany, and Switzerland. Using the scenario methodology, the  possibilities of analog professional care (Analog Care), fully robotic  professional care (Robotic Care), teams of robots and professional caregivers  (Deep Care), and professional caregivers supported by robots (Smart Care) were  discussed. The scenarios were used as a stimulus for the development of ideas  about future professional caregiving. The discussion was evaluated using  qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: The majority of the experts were in favor  of care in which people are supported by technology (Deep Care) and developed  similar scenarios with a focus on dignity-centeredness. The discussions then  focused on the steps necessary for its implementation, highlighting a strong need  for the development of eHealth competence in society, a change in the training of  professional caregivers, and cross-sectoral concepts. The experts also saw user  acceptance as crucial to the use of robotics. This involves the acceptance of  both professional caregivers and care recipients. CONCLUSIONS: The literature  review and subsequent workshop revealed how decision-making about the value of  social robots depends on personal characteristics related to experience and  values. There is therefore a strong need to recognize individual perspectives of  care before social robots become an integrated part of care in the future.

AB  - The demographics in Denmark are changing. People's life expectancy is increasing, which puts a strain on the home care resources. The aim of this article is to get  a deeper insight to how a specific medication robot in elders' homes can be  further developed and modified to create more independence. An insight to the end  users is created through the use of participatory design methods. The methods  illuminate the fact that the medication robots design is gawky, its alarm volume  is too low, the robot itself is too big and that it lacks the functionality of  being transportable.

AB  - The study on robot-assisted therapy in a pediatric field has not been applied sufficiently in clinical settings. The purpose of this pilot study is to explore  the potential therapeutic effects of a group robot intervention (GRI), using  dog-like social robot (SR) 'aibo' in pediatric ward. GRI by aibo was conducted  for those children with chronic illness (127 in total) who are hospitalized in  National Centre for Child Health and Development (NCCHD), and their caregivers  (116 in total), from March to April 2018. The observer made structured  behavioural observation records, based on which qualitative research on the  features of their words and conducts, were carried out. As a result, first,  during the GRI, about 2/3 of total expression by children were positive, while  about 1/4 were negative or inappropriate. On the other hand, as seen in the  'change' group, those children who had originally responded with negative  expression eventually came to express positive expression, while getting involved  in a ternary relationship or participating in a session more than once. Secondly,  as for the expression from the caregivers during the GRI, active expressions such  as 'participation' and 'exploration' accounted for the 2/3, while 1/3 turned out  to be rather placid expressions such as 'watch over' or 'encourage.'Conclusion:  There has not been any precedent study on the features of words and conducts  expressed by patients and their caregivers during the GRI by aibo. The outcome  suggests that aibo could possibly be used as a tool for group robot-assisted  therapy in the pediatric treatment setting. What is Known: • The study on  robot-assisted therapy in a pediatric field has only just begun. • Though many  kinds of social robot have been reportedly used so far, none has yet to be  applied in clinical settings What is New: • Our study revealed the features of  words and behaviour expressed by the patients and their caregivers, when dog-like  social robot 'aibo' was used for a group robot intervention in the pediatric  ward. • The outcome suggests that aibo could possibly be used as a tool for group  robot-assisted therapy in the pediatric treatment setting.

AB  - AIM: The study aimed to explore the views and attitudes of care home workers about the socially assistive robot that was trialled in their workplace, in order  to identify training needs in relation to the hypothetical future use of these  robots in their workplace. BACKGROUND: Care home workers face challenging  workload conditions which may require the exploration of new solutions such as  the use of socially assistive robots (SARs). METHODS: This is a qualitative  descriptive study which used semi-structured interviews. Care home workers  (n = 23) in the UK participated in the study, and data collection took place  between October 2019 and January 2020. NVivo software was used for data  management, and a thematic inductive analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Findings  indicated that many participants were open to the use of robots and valued the  potential usefulness of SARs in the care setting. However, some participants  showed resistance to the use of robots and did not feel comfortable with the idea  of working alongside them. Participants wished to receive technical training that  would enable them to be competent in using SARs. Participants took seriously  their duty of care to the older people and thus wanted to ensure that the use of  the SAR would not negatively impact on the care being provided. Robots were  viewed as having potential to be supplementary to human carers, such as sharing  the workload and improving upon the care already being provided. CONCLUSIONS:  Care home workers express both positive and negative views in relation to the  hypothetical future deployment of socially assistive humanoid robots in their  workplace. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The findings highlighted the importance of  values around person-centred care which should be taken into account when  planning for the implementation of robots in social care settings and training  care home workers in how to work with robots.

AB  - Craniofacial anomaly including deformational plagiocephaly as a result of deformities in head and facial bones evolution is a serious health problem in  newbies. The impact of such condition on the affected infants is profound from  both medical and social viewpoint. Indeed, timely diagnosing through different  medical examinations like anthropometric measurements of the skull or even  Computer Tomography (CT) image modality followed by a periodical screening and  monitoring plays a vital role in treatment phase. In this paper, a classification  model for detecting and monitoring deformational plagiocephaly in affected  infants is presented. The presented model is based on a deep learning network  architecture. The given model achieves high accuracy of 99.01% with other  classification parameters. The input to the model are the images captured by  commonly used smartphone cameras which waives the requirement to sophisticated  medical imaging modalities. The method is deployed into a mobile application  which enables the parents/caregivers and non-clinical experts to monitor and  report the treatment progress at home.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: A substantial proportion of the 40 million people in the US who present to emergency departments (EDs) each year after traumatic events develop  posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or major depressive episode (MDE).  Accurately identifying patients at high risk in the ED would facilitate the  targeting of preventive interventions. OBJECTIVES: To develop and validate a  prediction tool based on ED reports after a motor vehicle collision to predict  PTSD or MDE 3 months later. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Advancing  Understanding of Recovery After Trauma (AURORA) study is a longitudinal study  that examined adverse posttraumatic neuropsychiatric sequalae among patients who  presented to 28 US urban EDs in the immediate aftermath of a traumatic  experience. Enrollment began on September 25, 2017. The 1003 patients considered  in this diagnostic/prognostic report completed 3-month assessments by January 31,  2020. Each patient received a baseline ED assessment along with follow-up  self-report surveys 2 weeks, 8 weeks, and 3 months later. An ensemble machine  learning method was used to predict 3-month PTSD or MDE from baseline  information. Data analysis was performed from November 1, 2020, to May 31, 2021.  MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 was used to assess PTSD  and the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Depression  Short-Form 8b to assess MDE. RESULTS: A total of 1003 patients (median  [interquartile range] age, 34.5 [24-43] years; 715 [weighted 67.9%] female; 100  [weighted 10.7%] Hispanic, 537 [weighted 52.7%] non-Hispanic Black, 324 [weighted  32.2%] non-Hispanic White, and 42 [weighted 4.4%] of non-Hispanic other race or  ethnicity were included in this study. A total of 274 patients (weighted 26.6%)  met criteria for 3-month PTSD or MDE. An ensemble machine learning model  restricted to 30 predictors estimated in a training sample (patients from the  Northeast or Midwest) had good prediction accuracy (mean [SE] area under the  curve [AUC], 0.815 [0.031]) and calibration (mean [SE] integrated calibration  index, 0.040 [0.002]; mean [SE] expected calibration error, 0.039 [0.002]) in an  independent test sample (patients from the South). Patients in the top 30% of  predicted risk accounted for 65% of all 3-month PTSD or MDE, with a mean (SE)  positive predictive value of 58.2% (6.4%) among these patients at high risk. The  model had good consistency across regions of the country in terms of both AUC  (mean [SE], 0.789 [0.025] using the Northeast as the test sample and 0.809  [0.023] using the Midwest as the test sample) and calibration (mean [SE]  integrated calibration index, 0.048 [0.003] using the Northeast as the test  sample and 0.024 [0.001] using the Midwest as the test sample; mean [SE] expected  calibration error, 0.034 [0.003] using the Northeast as the test sample and 0.025  [0.001] using the Midwest as the test sample). The most important predictors in  terms of Shapley Additive Explanations values were symptoms of anxiety  sensitivity and depressive disposition, psychological distress in the 30 days  before motor vehicle collision, and peritraumatic psychosomatic symptoms.  CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results of this study suggest that a short set of  questions feasible to administer in an ED can predict 3-month PTSD or MDE with  good AUC, calibration, and geographic consistency. Patients at high risk can be  identified in the ED for targeting if cost-effective preventive interventions are  developed.

AB  - Expressed emotion (EE), a measure of the family's emotional climate, is a fundamental measure in caregiving research. A core dimension of EE is the level  of criticism expressed by the caregiver to the care recipient, with a high level  of criticism a marker of significant distress in the household. The Five-Minute  Speech Sample (FMSS), the most commonly used brief measure of EE, requires  time-consuming manual processing and scoring by a highly trained expert. In this  study, we used natural language processing and supervised machine learning  techniques to develop a fully automated framework to evaluate caregiver criticism  level based on the verbatim transcript of the FMSS. The success of the machine  learning algorithm was established by demonstrating that the classification of  maternal caregivers as high versus low EE was consistent with the classification  of these 298 maternal caregivers of adult children with schizophrenia using  standard manual coding procedures, with area under the receiver operating  characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.76. Evidence of construct validity was  established by demonstrating that maternal caregivers of adults with  schizophrenia, who were classified as having a high level of criticism had higher  levels of caregiver burden, reported that their child had more psychiatric  symptoms and behaviors and perceived that their child had greater control over  these symptoms and behaviors. Additionally, maternal caregivers who had high  levels of criticism reported having a poorer quality of relationship with their  child with schizophrenia than maternal caregivers low on criticism. Rapid  measurement of criticism facilitates the incorporation of this dimension into  research across a broad range of caregiving contexts.

Therefore, the authors created a more accurate  description of a patient's condition by extracting risk factors from clinical  notes to build predictive models to identify a patient's risk of wound infection  in HHC. METHODS: The structured data (eg, standardized assessments) and  unstructured information (eg, narrative-free text charting) were retrospectively  reviewed for HHC patients with wounds who were served by a large HHC agency in  2014. Wound infection risk factors were identified through bivariate analysis and  stepwise variable selection. Risk predictive performance of three machine  learning models (logistic regression, random forest, and artificial neural  network) was compared. RESULTS: A total of 754 of 54,316 patients (1.39%) had a  hospitalization or ED visit related to wound infection. In the bivariate logistic  regression, language describing wound type in the patient's clinical notes was  strongly associated with risk (odds ratio, 9.94; P < .05). The areas under the  curve were 0.82 in logistic regression, 0.75 in random forest, and 0.78 in  artificial neural network. Risk prediction performance of the models improved (by  up to 13.2%) after adding risk factors extracted from clinical notes.  CONCLUSIONS: Logistic regression showed the best risk prediction performance in  prediction of wound infection-related hospitalization or ED visits in HHC. The  use of data extracted from clinical notes can improve the performance of risk  prediction models.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The Global Assessment of Change (GAC) item has facilitated the interpretation of change in patient-reported outcomes, providing an anchor for  computing minimally important differences. Construct validity has been documented  via disease-specific patient-reported outcomes change. We examined what domains,  sociodemographic characteristics, attributions of change, and cognitive-appraisal  processes are reflected in GAC ratings. METHODS: This secondary analysis examined  data from 1,481 chronically ill patients and caregivers surveyed at baseline and  17 months. Items queried change since baseline in overall disease symptoms (GAC)  and in physical, emotional, and social functioning. Candidate predictors included  sociodemographic factors, health-related quality-of-life domains, change  attributions, and quality-of-life appraisal processes. Least absolute shrinkage  and selection operator and bootstrapping tested 77 predictors' effectiveness and  stability. RESULTS: GAC worsening was notably associated with being disabled (β  = -0.24) and having difficulty paying bills (β = -0.13). GAC was better explained  by the physical domain than the emotional or social (β = 0.67, 0.10, and 0.03,  respectively; R(2)(adj) = 0.63) after sociodemographic-covariate adjustment. In a  separate model (R(2)(adj) = 0.18), GAC variance was explained by attributions  about changing health and changing response of one's health team, goals related  to solving healthcare problems and maintaining activities, and appraisal about  things getting better (β = -0.14, 0.08, -0.07, 0.05, 0.21, respectively; p(range)  ~0.0005-0.05) after adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: The GAC primarily reflects the  physical domain, and the GAC reflects attributions, goals, and patterns of  emphasis related to change in health and healthcare. Commonly unmeasured factors  have some bearing on GAC scores and can facilitate the interpretation of change.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To reduce the physical burden of caregivers, wearable transfer support robots are highly desirable. Although these robots are reportedly  effective for specific tasks in experimental environments, there is little  information about their effectiveness at nursing care facilities. The aim of this  study was to identify care tasks and operations suitable for the use of these  robots among caregivers in nursing facilities where these robots have been in use  on a daily basis. METHODS: A 1-min observational time-motion analysis was  conducted to examine care tasks and operations in two nursing facilities where  wearable transfer support robots, namely Muscle Suit or HAL® Lumbar Type for Care  Support, have been used routinely on a daily basis for more than 24 months.  RESULTS: Analysis of the care tasks and their time ratio while wearing the  equipment revealed that both robots were used conspicuously for direct care in  over 70% of transits, especially during transfer assistance and toileting care.  Furthermore, these robots were used intensively in the morning along with wake-up  calls to care recipients, where pre-assigned wearers used them as part of their  "routine work." CONCLUSIONS: We found that these wearable transfer support robots  enabled effective performance of care tasks and operations in nursing facilities  where these robots have been used on a daily basis for an extended period of  time. These results may lead to the effective implementation and sustained  operation of other types of care robots in the future. TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN  Clinical Trials Registry no. UMIN000039204 .

AB  - Mechanical ventilation is an essential life-support treatment for patients who cannot breathe independently. Patient-ventilator asynchrony (PVA) occurs when  ventilatory support does not match the needs of the patient and is associated  with a series of adverse clinical outcomes. Deep learning methods have shown a  strong discriminative ability for PVA detection, but they require a large number  of annotated data for model training, which hampers their application to this  task. We developed a transfer learning architecture based on pretrained  convolutional neural networks (CNN) and used it for PVA recognition based on  small datasets. The one-dimensional signal was converted to a two-dimensional  image, and features were extracted by the CNN using pretrained weights for  classification. A partial dropping cross-validation technique was developed to  evaluate model performance on small datasets. When using large datasets, the  performance of the proposed method was similar to that of non-transfer learning  methods. However, when the amount of data was reduced to 1%, the accuracy of  transfer learning was approximately 90%, whereas the accuracy of the non-transfer  learning was less than 80%. The findings suggest that the proposed transfer  learning method can obtain satisfactory accuracies for PVA detection when using  small datasets. Such a method can promote the application of deep learning to  detect more types of PVA under various ventilation modes.

AB  - Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a rare neurodegenerative, fatal and currently incurable disease. People with ALS need support from informal  caregivers due to the motor and cognitive decline caused by the disease. This  study aims to identify caregivers whose quality of life (QoL) may be impacted as  a result of caring for a person with ALS. In this study, we worked towards the  identification of the predictors of a caregiver's QoL in addition to the  development of a model for clinical use to alert clinicians when a caregiver is  at risk of experiencing low QoL. The data were collected through the Irish ALS  Registry and via interviews on several topics with 90 patient and caregiver pairs  at three time-points. The McGill QoL questionnaire was used to assess caregiver  QoL-the MQoL Single Item Score measures the overall QoL and was selected as the  outcome of interest in this work. The caregiver's existential QoL and burden, as  well as the patient's depression and employment before the onset of symptoms were  the features that had the highest impact in predicting caregiver quality of life.  A small subset of features that could be easy to collect was used to develop a  second model to use it in a clinical setting. The most predictive features for  that model were the weekly caregiving duties, age and health of the caregiver, as  well as the patient's physical functioning and age of onset.

AB  - AIMS: This paper analyses the factors that influence home care employees' intention to introduce robots. BACKGROUND: The introduction of different kinds of  care robots is a topical issue in elderly care now and in the near future.  METHODS: Cross-sectional research conducted through a questionnaire. The survey  data (N = 162) were collected in five locations around Finland in 2019. The  analysis was carried out by regression analysis, Sobel test and by Hayes'  bootstrapping method. RESULTS: The results show that self-efficacy is pivotal in  the willingness to introduce care robots. Employees' age increases the enthusiasm  to introduce robots but reduces self-efficacy. Work engagement does not correlate  with self-efficacy or behavioural intention related to the introduction of care  robots. CONCLUSIONS: The present paper reveals the significance of attitudes,  cognitive factors and age in the adoption of care robots in home care facilities.  PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: It is important to pay attention to supporting the  employees' sense of technology management and the construction of a  robot-positive atmosphere when introducing care robots, and the development of  skills of older employees and employees with a lower educational level should be  supported.

AB  - Rare diseases occur globally at every stage of life. Patients, families and caregivers have many unmet medical and social needs leading to extraordinary  psychosocial and economic burdens. Efforts to improve diagnostic capabilities and  to develop therapies for an estimated 7000 rare diseases have met with  considerable success. In the United States, a rare disease or condition is one  affecting fewer than 200,000 people. In the European Union (EU), a rare disease  is any disease affecting fewer than 5 people in 10,000 (less than 1 in 2000  people). However, there are no effective treatments for 90 per cent of rare  diseases. There is a need to expand awareness, advocacy and outreach to everyone  including those with low incomes, poor literacy, minority ethnic status and  living in underserved and marginalised populations in urban and rural areas as  well as in developing nations throughout the world. The acceptance of patients as  research partners complements the increased research emphasis and major  regulatory initiatives leading to expedited review and approval programmes for  products for serious or life-threatening conditions. The pipeline of new  therapies provides hope to untreated patients. Advances in medical  bioinformatics, artificial intelligence and machine learning with access to big  data continue to identify novel therapeutics for screening and evaluation.  Advanced analytics can identify the patterns of disease occurrence, predict  disease progression, identify patient response to treatments, establish optimal  care guidelines and generate research hypotheses with the narrowly identified  research patient populations.

AB  - Many countries face major challenges to ensure that their health and social care systems are ready for the growing numbers of older people (OP). As a way of  realising ageing in place, assistive technologies such as home-care robots are  expected to play a greater role in the future. In Asia and Europe, robots are  gradually being adopted as a public policy solution to the workforce shortage.  Yet, there is still a strongly held belief that such technologies should not be  part of human and personal care services such as OP's care. However, there has  been little research into attitudes and perceptions of potential users regarding  home-care robots which can provide companionship and support with activities of  daily living. To explore these in more detail, a questionnaire study was carried  out in Finland, Ireland and Japan. This study reports findings from the Irish  cohort (114 older people [OP], 8 family carers and 56 Health and Social Care  Professionals [HSCPs]). Seventy per cent of the total respondents (N = 178)  reported being open to the use of home-care robots, and only one quarter had a  negative image of robots. People with care responsibilities in their private  capacity expressed more interest in, and readiness to use, home-care robots,  while stressing the importance of 'privacy protection' and 'guaranteed access to  human care'. Both OP and HSCPs identified observation and recording of OP's  mental and physical condition as desirable functions of such robots, whereas  practical functions such as fall prevention and mobility support were also deemed  desirable by HSCPs. There is generally positive interest in home-care robots  among Irish respondents. Findings strongly suggest that the interest is generated  partly by great need among people who deliver care. Should such robots be  developed, then careful consideration must be given to user-centred design,  ethical aspects and national care policy.

AB  - Due to the aging population, home care for the elderly has become very important. Currently, there are many studies focusing on the deployment of various sensors  in the house to recognize the home activities of the elderly, especially for the  elderly living alone. Through these, we can detect the home situation of the  single person and ensure his/her living safety. However, the living environment  of the elderly includes, not only the person living alone, but also multiple  people living together. By applying the traditional methods for a multi-resident  environment, the "individual" activities of each person could not be accurately  identified. This resulted in an inability to distinguish which person was  involved in what activities, and thus, failed to provide personal care.  Therefore, this research tries to investigate how to recognize home activities in  multi-resident living environments, in order to accurately distinguish the  association between residents and home activities. Specifically, we propose to  use the special characteristics of historical activity of residents in a  multi-person environment, including activity interaction, activity frequency,  activity period length, and residential behaviors, and then apply a suite of  machine learning methods to train and test. Five traditional models of supervised  learning and two deep learning methods are explored to tackle this problem.  Through the experiments with real datasets, the proposed methods were found to  achieve higher precision, recall and accuracy with less training time. The best  accuracy can reach up to 91% and 95%, by J48DT, and LSTM, respectively, in  different living environments.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the expectations of informal caregivers, nurses, and dementia trainers regarding the support of (physical and psychosocial) human  needs by humanoid social assistive robots (SARs) in dementia care. METHODS: A  qualitative study was conducted with 11 homogeneous focus groups of informal  caregivers, nurses and dementia trainers providing dementia care at home, in  adult daycare centers, or in nursing homes. A qualitative content analysis was  performed using a concept- and data-driven coding frame. RESULTS: Focus group  discussions with 52 individuals were held. Participants reported mostly positive  expectations and stated that SARs could offer potential support in all components  of human needs, especially in avoiding danger (e.g. recognise danger, organise  help), communication/contact with others (e.g. enable telephone calls, provide  company), daily activities (e.g. remind of appointments, household obligations),  recreational activities (e.g. provide music), eating/drinking (e.g. help cook),  and mobility/body posture (e.g. give reminders/instructions for physical  exercise). Participants also mentioned some negative expectations in all human  needs, predominantly in communication/contact with others (e.g. loss of  interpersonal interaction) and avoiding danger (e.g. scepticism regarding  emergencies). CONCLUSION: Participants stated that SARs had great potential to  provide assistance in dementia care, especially by reminding,  motivating/encouraging and instructing people with dementia. Informal caregivers  and nurses also considered them as useful supportive devices for themselves.  However, participants also mentioned negative expectations, especially in  communication/contact with others and avoiding danger. These findings demonstrate  the support caregivers and dementia trainers expect from humanoid SARs and may  contribute to their optimisation for dementia care.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Patient-ventilator asynchrony (PVA) is the result of a mismatch between the need of patients and the assistance provided by the  ventilator during mechanical ventilation. Because the poor interaction between  the patient and the ventilator is associated with inferior clinical outcomes,  effort should be made to identify and correct their occurrence. Deep learning has  shown promising ability in PVA detection; however, lack of network  interpretability hampers its application in clinic. METHODS: We proposed an  interpretable one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1DCNN) to detect four  most manifestation types of PVA (double triggering, ineffective efforts during  expiration, premature cycling and delayed cycling) under pressure control  ventilation mode and pressure support ventilation mode. A global average pooling  (GAP) layer was incorporated with the 1DCNN model to highlight the sections of  the respiratory waveform the model focused on when making a classification.  Dilation convolution and batch normalization were introduced to the 1DCNN model  for compensating the reduction of performance caused by the GAP layer. RESULTS:  The proposed interpretable 1DCNN exhibited comparable performance with the  state-of-the-art deep learning model in PVA detection. The F1 scores for the  detection of four types of PVA under pressure control ventilation and pressure  support ventilation modes were greater than 0.96. The critical sections of the  waveform used to detect PVA were highlighted, and found to be well consistent  with the understanding of the respective type of PVA by experts. CONCLUSIONS: The  findings suggest that the proposed 1DCNN can help detect PVA, and enhance the  interpretability of the classification process to help clinicians better  understand the results obtained from deep learning technology.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a deep learning-based decision tree for the primary care setting, to stratify adult patients with confirmed and unconfirmed coronavirus  disease 2019 (COVID-19), and to predict the need for hospitalization or home  monitoring. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study on  data from patients admitted to a COVID hospital in Rome, Italy, between 5 March  2020 and 5 June 2020. A confirmed case was defined as a patient with a positive  nasopharyngeal RT-PCR test result, while an unconfirmed case had negative results  on repeated swabs. Patients' medical history and clinical, laboratory and  radiological findings were collected, and the dataset was used to train a  predictive model for COVID-19 severity. RESULTS: Data of 198 patients were  included in the study. Twenty-eight (14.14%) had mild disease, 62 (31.31%) had  moderate disease, 64 (32.32%) had severe disease, and 44 (22.22%) had critical  disease. The G2 value assessed the contribution of each collected value to  decision tree building. On this basis, SpO2 (%) with a cut point at 92 was chosen  for the optimal first split. Therefore, the decision tree was built using values  maximizing G2 and LogWorth. After the tree was built, the correspondence between  inputs and outcomes was validated. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a machine  learning-based tool that is easy to understand and apply. It provides good  discrimination in stratifying confirmed and unconfirmed COVID-19 patients with  different prognoses in every context. Our tool might allow general practitioners  visiting patients at home to decide whether the patient needs to be hospitalized.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to evaluate the effectiveness of humanoid robot-based distraction on reducing distress and pain in children undergoing  intravenous insertion. METHODS: A two-arm, open-label randomized controlled trial  was conducted April 2017-May 2018, in a pediatric emergency department (ED). A  sample of 86 children aged 6-11 years who required intravenous insertion were  recruited. Exclusion criteria included hearing/visual impairments, neurocognitive  delay, sensory impairment to pain, previous enrollment, and ED clinical staff  discretion. Outcome measures included the Observed Scale of Behavioral  Distress-Revised (OSBD-R) (distress) and the Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R)  (pain). RESULTS: Of the 86 children recruited (median age 9 years, IQR 7,10); 55%  (47/86) were male, 9% (7/82) were premature, 82% (67/82) had a previous ED visit,  31% (25/82) had a previous hospitalization and 78% (64/82) had previous  intravenous insertion. Ninety-six percent (78/81) received topical anesthetic  prior to intravenous insertion. Total OSBD-R distress score was 1.49 ± 2.36  (standard care) versus 0.78 ± 1.32 (robot) (p < 0.05). FPS-R pain score was 4  (IQR 2,6) (standard care) versus 2 (IQR 0,4) (robot) (p = 0.13). Parental anxiety  immediately after the procedure was 36.7 (11.1) (standard care) versus 31.3 (8.5)  (robot) (p = 0.04). Parents were more satisfied with pain management in the  robotic distraction group (95% vs 72% very satisfied) (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS:  Humanoid robot-based distraction therapy is associated with a modest positive  impact on child distress for pediatric intravenous insertion, but not pain. It  can be considered a potential tool in the ED toolkit for procedural  pain-associated distress reduction. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION:  Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02997631.

AB  - Out of all the changes to our daily life brought by the COVID-19 pandemic, one of the most significant ones has been the limited access to health services that we  used to take for granted. Thus, in order to prevent temporary injuries from  having lingering or permanent effects, the need for home rehabilitation device is  urgent. For this reason, this paper proposes a cable-driven device for limb  rehabilitation, CUBE(2), with a novel end-effector (EE) design and autotuning  capabilities to enable autonomous use. The proposed design is presented as an  evolution of the previous CUBE design. In this paper, the proposed device is  modelled and analyzed with finite element analysis. Then, a novel vision-based  control strategy is described. Furthermore, a prototype has been manufactured and  validated experimentally. Preliminary test to estimate home position  repeatability has been carried out.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) has been described as the "fourth industrial revolution" with transformative and global implications, including in  healthcare, public health, and global health. AI approaches hold promise for  improving health systems worldwide, as well as individual and population health  outcomes. While AI may have potential for advancing health equity within and  between countries, we must consider the ethical implications of its deployment in  order to mitigate its potential harms, particularly for the most vulnerable. This  scoping review addresses the following question: What ethical issues have been  identified in relation to AI in the field of health, including from a global  health perspective? METHODS: Eight electronic databases were searched for peer  reviewed and grey literature published before April 2018 using the concepts of  health, ethics, and AI, and their related terms. Records were independently  screened by two reviewers and were included if they reported on AI in relation to  health and ethics and were written in the English language. Data was charted on a  piloted data charting form, and a descriptive and thematic analysis was  performed. RESULTS: Upon reviewing 12,722 articles, 103 met the predetermined  inclusion criteria. The literature was primarily focused on the ethics of AI in  health care, particularly on carer robots, diagnostics, and precision medicine,  but was largely silent on ethics of AI in public and population health. The  literature highlighted a number of common ethical concerns related to privacy,  trust, accountability and responsibility, and bias. Largely missing from the  literature was the ethics of AI in global health, particularly in the context of  low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). CONCLUSIONS: The ethical issues  surrounding AI in the field of health are both vast and complex. While AI holds  the potential to improve health and health systems, our analysis suggests that  its introduction should be approached with cautious optimism. The dearth of  literature on the ethics of AI within LMICs, as well as in public health, also  points to a critical need for further research into the ethical implications of  AI within both global and public health, to ensure that its development and  implementation is ethical for everyone, everywhere.

AB  - Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) impacts 1 in 54 children in the US. Two-thirds of children with ASD display problem behavior. If a caregiver can predict that a  child is likely to engage in problem behavior, they may be able to take action to  minimize that risk. Although experts in Applied Behavior Analysis can offer  caregivers recognition and remediation strategies, there are limitations to the  extent to which human prediction of problem behavior is possible without the  assistance of technology. In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based  predictive framework, PreMAC, that uses multimodal signals from precursors of  problem behaviors to alert caregivers of impending problem behavior for children  with ASD. A multimodal data capture platform, M2P3, was designed to collect  multimodal training data for PreMAC. The development of PreMAC integrated a rapid  functional analysis, the interview-informed synthesized contingency analysis  (IISCA), for collection of training data. A feasibility study with seven 4 to  15-year-old children with ASD was conducted to investigate the tolerability and  feasibility of the M2P3 platform and the accuracy of PreMAC. Results indicate  that the M2P3 platform was well tolerated by the children and PreMAC could  predict precursors of problem behaviors with high prediction accuracies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nurses often document patient symptoms in narrative notes. PURPOSE: This study used a technique called natural language processing (NLP) to: (1)  Automatically identify documentation of seven common symptoms (anxiety, cognitive  disturbance, depressed mood, fatigue, sleep disturbance, pain, and well-being) in  homecare narrative nursing notes, and (2) examine the association between  symptoms and emergency department visits or hospital admissions from homecare.  METHOD: NLP was applied on a large subset of narrative notes (2.5 million notes)  documented for 89,825 patients admitted to one large homecare agency in the  Northeast United States. FINDINGS: NLP accurately identified symptoms in  narrative notes. Patients with more documented symptom categories had higher risk  of emergency department visit or hospital admission. DISCUSSION: Further research  is needed to explore additional symptoms and implement NLP systems in the  homecare setting to enable early identification of concerning patient trends  leading to emergency department visit or hospital admission.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of a home-based over-ground robotic-assisted gait training program using the AlterG Bionic Leg orthosis on clinical functional  outcomes in people with chronic stroke. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial.  SETTING: Home. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-four ambulatory chronic stroke patients who  recieve usual physiotherapy. INTERVENTION: Usual physiotherapy plus either  (1)10-week over-ground robotic-assisted gait training program (n = 16), using the  device for ⩾30 minutes per day, or (2) control group (n = 18), 30 minutes of  physical activity per day. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was the Six-Minute  Walk Test. Secondary outcomes included: Timed-Up-and-Go, Functional Ambulation  Categories, Dynamic Gait Index and Berg Balance Scale. Physical activity and  sedentary time were assessed using accelerometry. All measurements were completed  at baseline, 10 and 22 weeks after baseline. RESULTS: Significant increases in  walking distance were observed for the Six-Minute Walk Test between baseline and  10 weeks for over-ground robotic-assisted gait training (135 ± 81 m vs  158 ± 93 m, respectively; P ⩽ 0.001) but not for control (122 ± 92 m vs  119 ± 84 m, respectively). Findings were similar for Functional Ambulation  Categories, Dynamic Gait Index and Berg Balance Scale (all P ⩽ 0.01). For  over-ground robotic-assisted gait training, there were increases in time spent  stepping, number of steps taken, number of sit-to-stand transitions, and  reductions in time spent sitting/supine between baseline and 10 weeks (all  P < 0.05). The differences observed in all of the aforementioned outcome measures  were maintained at 22 weeks, 12 weeks after completing the intervention (all  P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Over-ground robotic-assisted gait training combined with  physiotherapy in chronic stroke patients led to significant improvements in  clinical functional outcomes and physical activity compared to the control group.  Improvements were maintained at 22 weeks.

AB  - A sensor-rich environment can be exploited for elder healthcare applications. In this work, our objective was to conduct a continuous and long-term analysis of  elderly's behavior for detecting changes. We indeed did not study snapshots of  the behavior but, rather, analyzed the overall behavior evolution over long  periods of time in order to detect anomalies. Therefore, we proposed a learning  method and formalize a normal behavior pattern for elderly people related to  her/his Activities of Daily Living (ADL). We also defined a temporal similarity  score between activities that allows detecting behavior changes over time. During  the periods of time when behavior changes occurred, we then focused on each  activity to identify anomalies. Finally, when a behavior change occurred, it was  also necessary to help caregivers and/or family members understand the possible  pathology detected in order for them to react accordingly. Therefore, the  framework presented in this article includes a fuzzy logic-based decision support  system that provides information about the suspected disease and its severity.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare muscle activity in caregivers while using a novel robotic-assisted transfer device (Strong Arm) to a clinical  standard of care (Hoyer Advance). DESIGN: A quasi-experimental design was used in  which 20 caregivers (33 ± 15 yrs old) performed transfers with three surfaces  (toilet, bench, and shower chair) with the Strong Arm and Hoyer Advance. Transfer  completion time (seconds), peak percentage surface electromyography (EMG), and  integrated EMG of the bilateral erector spinae, latissimus dorsi, pectoralis  major and anterior deltoid were measured. RESULTS: Caregivers required less  transfer time when transferring from wheelchair to surface using the Hoyer  Advance (P = 0.011, f = 0.39). For the lower back, significantly lower peak  percentage EMGs were found using Strong Arm in 50% and for the integrated EMG in  25% of the cases, with the remaining cases showing no significant differences.  For the shoulder, significantly lower peak percentage EMG values were found using  Strong Arm in 19% of transfers and lower integrated EMG was found in 25% of  transfers when using the Hoyer Advance, with the remaining cases showing no  significant differences. CONCLUSION: Although back muscle activation during  Strong Arm transfers is statistically, but not clinically, lower, additional  features that couple with significantly lower muscle activation make it an  alternative to the clinical standard for further research and possible clinical  applicability.

AB  - People with dementia often experience loneliness and social isolation. This can result in increased cognitive decline which, in turn, has a negative impact on  quality of life. This paper explores the use of the social robot, MARIO, with  older people living with dementia as a way of addressing these issues. A  descriptive qualitative study was conducted to explore the perceptions and  experiences of the use and impact of MARIO. The research took place in the UK,  Italy and Ireland. Semi-structured interviews were held in each location with  people with dementia (n = 38), relatives/carers (n = 28), formal carers (n = 28)  and managers (n = 13). The data was analyzed using qualitative content analysis.  The findings revealed that despite challenges in relation to voice recognition  and the practicalities of conducting research involving robots in real-life  settings, most participants were positive about MARIO. Through the robot's  user-led design and personalized applications, MARIO provided a point of  interest, social activities, and cognitive engagement increased. However, some  formal carers and managers voiced concern that robots might replace care staff.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Home care for older people with dementia (PwD) is associated with special needs and requires appropriate support services as well as learning and  developmental impulses from a geragogical perspective. The accompanied use of  robotic technology can be a suitable approach. OBJECTIVE: In the Federal Ministry  for Education and Research (BMBF)-funded research and development (R and D)  project "OurPuppet" (2016-2019), an accompaniment profile was to be developed and  tested in order to introduce a technical intervention (sensor-based robotic  system in form of a puppet) into the home care of PwD. The aim was to stimulate  technology learning, to motivate the use of technology and to contribute to the  stability of the care situation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A partially standardized  and qualitative evaluation of the concept in the preparation course for the  accompaniment profile and a qualitative in-process evaluation of the  accompaniment approach in an explorative practical test over several months  within five families took place. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The puppet accompaniment  approach, which was developed, tested and evaluated in the R and D project  "OurPuppet" is presented. The participatory curriculum development and  self-determined learning can be seen as success factors for the appropriation  processes. The accompanied introduction of techniques has proven to be  profitable. The added value experienced by the users goes far beyond  a user-oriented technology design. The feasibility and acceptance of the  technology and support approach in the context of home care of PwD has been  proven. For further development, sustainable structures have been created with  the establishment of the Network Center for Engagement, Support and Accompaniment  at the "Hochschule für Gesundheit Bochum" (hsg).

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine hesitancy or refusal is common among parents of adolescents. An understanding of public perceptions from the  perspective of behavior change theories can facilitate effective and targeted  vaccine promotion strategies. OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate deep learning  models for understanding public perceptions of HPV vaccines from the perspective  of behavior change theories using data from social media. DESIGN, SETTING, AND  PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study, conducted from April to August  2019, included longitudinal and geographic analyses of public perceptions  regarding HPV vaccines, using sampled HPV vaccine-related Twitter discussions  collected from January 2014 to October 2018. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The  prevalence of social media discussions related to the construct of health belief  model (HBM) and theory of planned behavior (TPB), categorized by deep learning  algorithms. Locally estimated scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) revealed trends of  constructs. Social media users' US state-level home location information was  extracted from their profiles, and geographic analyses were performed to identify  the clustering of public perceptions of the HPV vaccine. RESULTS: A total of  1 431 463 English-language posts from 486 116 unique usernames were collected.  Deep learning algorithms achieved F-1 scores ranging from 0.6805 (95% CI,  0.6516-0.7094) to 0.9421 (95% CI, 0.9380-0.9462) in mapping discussions to the  constructs of behavior change theories. LOESS revealed trends in constructs; for  example, prevalence of perceived barriers, a construct of HBM, deceased from its  apex in July 2015 (56.2%) to its lowest prevalence in October 2018 (28.4%;  difference, 27.8%; P < .001); Positive attitudes toward the HPV vaccine, a  construct of TPB, increased from early 2017 (30.7%) to 41.9% at the end of the  study (difference, 11.2%; P < .001), while negative attitudes decreased from  42.3% to 31.3% (difference, 11.0%; P < .001) during the same period. Interstate  variations in public perceptions of the HPV vaccine were also identified; for  example, the states of Ohio and Maine showed a relatively high prevalence of  perceived barriers (11 531 of 17 106 [67.4%] and 1157 of 1684 [68.7%]) and  negative attitudes (9655 of 17 197 [56.1%] and 1080 of 1793 [60.2%]). CONCLUSIONS  AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study provided a good understanding of public  perceptions on social media and evolving trends in terms of multiple dimensions.  The interstate variations of public perceptions could be associated with the rise  of local antivaccine sentiment. The methods described in this study represent an  early contribution to using existing empirically and theoretically based  frameworks that describe human decision-making in conjunction with more  intelligent deep learning algorithms. Furthermore, these data demonstrate the  ability to collect large-scale HPV vaccine perception and intention data that can  inform public health communication and education programs designed to improve  immunization rates at the community, state, or even national level.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Most terminally ill cancer patients prefer to die at home, but a majority die in institutional settings. Research questions about this discrepancy  have not been fully answered. This study applies artificial intelligence and  machine learning techniques to explore the complex network of factors and the  cause-effect relationships affecting the place of death, with the ultimate aim of  developing policies favouring home-based end-of-life care. METHODS: A data mining  algorithm and a causal probabilistic model for data analysis were developed with  information derived from expert knowledge that was merged with data from 116  deceased cancer patients in southern Switzerland. This data set was obtained via  a retrospective clinical chart review. RESULTS: Dependencies of disease and  treatment-related decisions demonstrate an influence on the place of death of  13%. Anticancer treatment in advanced disease prevents or delays communication  about the end of life between oncologists, patients and families. Unknown  preferences for the place of death represent a great barrier to a home death. A  further barrier is the limited availability of family caregivers for terminal  home care. The family's preference for the last place of care has a high impact  on the place of death of 51%, while the influence of the patient's preference is  low, at 14%. Approximately one-third of family systems can be empowered by health  care professionals to provide home care through open end-of-life communication  and good symptom management. Such intervention has an influence on the place of  death of 17%. If families express a convincing preference for home care, the  involvement of a specialist palliative home care service can increase the  probability of home deaths by 24%. CONCLUSION: Concerning death at home, open  communication about death and dying is essential. Furthermore, for the patient  preference for home care to be respected, the family's decision for the last  place of care seems to be key. The early initiation of family-centred palliative  care and the provision of specialist palliative home care for patients who wish  to die at home are suggested.

AB  - Socially assistive robotics (SAR) has great potential to provide accessible, affordable, and personalized therapeutic interventions for children with autism  spectrum disorders (ASD). However, human-robot interaction (HRI) methods are  still limited in their ability to autonomously recognize and respond to  behavioral cues, especially in atypical users and everyday settings. This work  applies supervised machine-learning algorithms to model user engagement in the  context of long-term, in-home SAR interventions for children with ASD.  Specifically, we present two types of engagement models for each user: (i)  generalized models trained on data from different users and (ii) individualized  models trained on an early subset of the user's data. The models achieved about  90% accuracy (AUROC) for post hoc binary classification of engagement, despite  the high variance in data observed across users, sessions, and engagement states.  Moreover, temporal patterns in model predictions could be used to reliably  initiate reengagement actions at appropriate times. These results validate the  feasibility and challenges of recognition and response to user disengagement in  long-term, real-world HRI settings. The contributions of this work also inform  the design of engaging and personalized HRI, especially for the ASD community.

T2  - Journal of advanced nursing
AB  - AIM: To explore the formal caregivers' perceptions and experiences of using pet robots for persons living with dementia residing in long-term care settings and  the factors influencing their perceptions by evaluating, integrating, and  synthesizing findings from relevant international research articles using a  meta-ethnography. DESIGN: Noblit and Hare's interpretative meta-ethnography. DATA  SOURCES: Eight articles, published between 2013-2018, were identified following a  systematic search of four databases (Scopus, ProQuest Central, EBSCO, and Google  Scholar) between June 2019-February 2020. REVIEW METHODS: Two researchers  independently appraised the selected articles. Noblit and Hare's seven steps and  a meta-ethnography reporting guidance were used. Reciprocal translation was used  to obtain a line of argument synthesis. RESULTS: Three overarching themes were  identified: a beneficial tool but not for everybody, a tool that has limitations  but could be overcome, and a positive experience if appropriately introduced and  sustained. CONCLUSION: This meta-ethnography contributes to the understanding of  current potential benefits and limitations of pet robots for persons living with  dementia residing in long-term settings. It also identifies several factors, as  perceived by caregivers, that may influence their acceptability, adoption, and  routine use in practice. IMPACT: Although for the past two decades pet robots  have been used as a psychosocial intervention for persons living with dementia in  long-term care settings, there is a dearth of literature on the perception of  formal caregivers and their experience of such interventions. While pet robots  can have emotional, social, behavioural, and practical benefits, there are  several technological, organizational, and contextual challenges and limitations  that constrain their routine use. The solutions synthesized in this review can be  of benefit to robot designers, facility managers, policy makers, and other health  care professionals interested in introducing pet robots in long-term care  settings.

AB  - Technological advances in elderly care have been rapid, and the introduction of robots in care will be a topical issue in the near future. There has been little  research into the possibility of influencing care workers' attitudes towards  robots by project activities, and how to make the change easier for work  communities. This study focuses on a robotics project that took place in elderly  and home care services in one municipality in Finland (total of 45 care workers).  During the project, four robotics workshops and one extended pilot session were  implemented. The study follows quasi-experimental settings, and it included two  measurements (before and after project activities) and a control group, but no  randomization. The data were collected by questionnaires and were analyzed  statistically. The project under study brought about minor positive changes in  home care workers' attitudes towards the usefulness of care robots. In the final  measurement, the difference between the test group and the control group was  significant in the two dimensions of positive attitudes. The research supports  the hypothesis that project activities can be used to influence home care  workers' attitudes towards robots. This can also facilitate the introduction of  care robots in home care services. However, the construction of a  technology-positive care culture is a long-term process, which requires training  and development, technological development and strong strategic management at  various levels.

AB  - Youths experiencing homelessness (YEH) often cycle between various sheltering locations including spending nights on the streets, in shelters and with others.  Few studies have explored the patterns of daily sheltering over time. A total of  66 participants completed 724 ecological momentary assessments that assessed  daily sleeping arrangements. Analyses applied a hypothesis-generating machine  learning algorithm (component-wise gradient boosting) to build interpretable  models that would select only the best predictors of daily sheltering from a  large set of 92 variables while accounting for the correlated nature of the data.  Sheltering was examined as a three-category outcome comparing nights spent  literally homeless, unstably housed or at a shelter. The final model retained 15  predictors. These predictors included (among others) specific stressors (e.g.,  not having a place to stay, parenting and hunger), discrimination (by a friend or  nonspecified other; due to race or homelessness), being arrested and synthetic  cannabinoids use (a.k.a., "kush"). The final model demonstrated success in  classifying the categorical outcome. These results have implications for  developing just-in-time adaptive interventions for improving the lives of YEH.

T2  - Journal of applied research in intellectual disabilities : JARID
AB  - BACKGROUND: The study explored the use of a robot-mediated therapeutic intervention in persons with visual and intellectual disabilities. METHOD: Three  robot-mediated intervention sessions were developed to teach three coping skills  for worrying. Effectiveness was examined using a multiple-baseline case study  design (N = 7). Baseline, pre-intervention and post-intervention assessments  included social validity, severity of worrying (PSWQ-C-NL), and observations by  caregivers (SDQ). Short checklists on worrying were repeated throughout baseline  and intervention stages. Transcripts of the sessions were analysed for  participants' emotional openness. RESULTS: Social validity was equally high  before and after the intervention. The intervention did not impact the severity  of worrying, although mentor caregivers reported a lower impact of personal  difficulties for participants. We found no change in self-disclosure towards the  robot over sessions. CONCLUSIONS: The participants' positive responses warrant  further exploration of using robot-mediated therapy for persons with visual and  intellectual disabilities. Recommendations for additional adaptations are  discussed.

TI  - Are we ready for artificial intelligence health monitoring in elder care?
AU  - Ho, Anita
T2  - BMC geriatrics
AB  - BACKGROUND: The world is experiencing a dramatic increase in the aging population, challenging the sustainability of traditional care models that have  relied on in-person monitoring. This debate article discusses whether artificial  intelligence health monitoring may be suitable enhancement or replacement for  elder care. MAIN TEXT: Internationally, as life expectancy continues to rise,  many countries are facing a severe shortage of direct care workers. The health  workforce is aging, and replacement remains a challenge. Artificial intelligence  health monitoring technologies may play a novel and significant role in filling  the human resource gaps in caring for older adults by complementing current care  provision, reducing the burden on family caregivers, and improving the quality of  care. Nonetheless, opportunities brought on by these emerging technologies raise  ethical questions that must be addressed to ensure that these automated systems  can truly enhance care and health outcomes for older adults. This debate article  explores some ethical dimensions of using automated health monitoring  technologies. It argues that, in order for these health monitoring technologies  to fulfill the wishes of older adults to age in place and also to empower them  and improve their quality of life, we need deep knowledge of how stakeholders may  balance their considerations of relational care, safety, and privacy. CONCLUSION:  It is only when we design artificial intelligence health monitoring technologies  with intersecting clinical and ethical factors in mind that the resulting systems  will enhance productive relational care, facilitate independent living, promote  older adults' health outcomes, and minimize waste.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Society is facing a global shortage of 17 million health care workers, along with increasing health care demands from a growing number of older  adults. Social robots are being considered as solutions to part of this problem.  OBJECTIVE: Our objective is to evaluate the quality of care perceived by patients  and caregivers for an integrated care pathway in an outpatient clinic using a  social robot for patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) interviews versus the  currently used professional interviews. METHODS: A multicenter,  two-parallel-group, nonblinded, randomized controlled trial was used to test for  noninferiority of the quality of care delivered through robot-assisted care. The  randomization was performed using a computer-generated table. The setting  consisted of two outpatient clinics, and the study took place from July to  December 2019. Of 419 patients who visited the participating outpatient clinics,  110 older patients met the criteria for recruitment. Inclusion criteria were the  ability to speak and read Dutch and being assisted by a participating health care  professional. Exclusion criteria were serious hearing or vision problems, serious  cognitive problems, and paranoia or similar psychiatric problems. The  intervention consisted of a social robot conducting a 36-item PROM. As the main  outcome measure, the customized Consumer Quality Index (CQI) was used, as  reported by patients and caregivers for the outpatient pathway of care. RESULTS:  In total, 75 intermediately frail older patients were included in the study,  randomly assigned to the intervention and control groups, and processed: 36  female (48%) and 39 male (52%); mean age 77.4 years (SD 7.3), range 60-91 years.  There was no significant difference in the total patient CQI scores between the  patients included in the robot-assisted care pathway (mean 9.27, SD 0.65, n=37)  and those in the control group (mean 9.00, SD 0.70, n=38): P=.08, 95% CI -0.04 to  0.58. There was no significant difference in the total CQI scores between  caregivers in the intervention group (mean 9.21, SD 0.76, n=30) and those in the  control group (mean 9.09, SD 0.60, n=35): P=.47, 95% CI -0.21 to 0.46. No harm or  unintended effects occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Geriatric patients and their informal  caregivers valued robot-assisted and nonrobot-assisted care pathways equally.

AB  - The benefits of automatic identification technologies in healthcare have been largely recognized. Nevertheless, unlocking their potential to support the most  knowledge-intensive medical tasks requires to go beyond mere item identification.  This paper presents an innovative Decision Support System (DSS), based on a  semantic enhancement of Near Field Communication (NFC) standard. Annotated  descriptions of medications and patient's case history are stored in NFC  transponders and used to help caregivers providing the right therapy. The  proposed framework includes a lightweight reasoning engine to infer possible  incompatibilities in treatment, suggesting substitute therapies. A working  prototype is presented in a rheumatology case study and preliminary performance  tests are reported. The approach is independent from back-end infrastructures.  The proposed DSS framework is validated in a limited but realistic case study,  and performance evaluation of the prototype supports its practical feasibility.  Automated reasoning on knowledge fragments extracted via NFC enables effective  decision support not only in hospital centers, but also in pervasive IoT-based  healthcare contexts such as first aid, ambulance transport, rehabilitation  facilities and home care.

AB  - INTRODUCTION:  As a subset of artificial intelligence, machine learning techniques (MLTs) may evaluate very large and raw datasets. In this study, the  aim is to establish a model by MLT for the prediction of enuresis in children.  MATERIALS AND METHODS:  The study included 8,071 elementary school students. A  total of 704 children had enuresis. For analysis of data with MLT, another group  including 704 nonenuretic children was structured with stratified sampling. Out  of 34 independent variables, 14 with high feature values significantly affecting  enuresis were selected. A model of estimation was created by training the data.  RESULTS:  Fourteen independent variables in order of feature importance value  were starting age of toilet training, having urinary urgency, holding maneuvers  to prevent voiding, frequency of defecation, history of enuresis in mother and  father, having child's own room, parent's education level, history of enuresis in  siblings, consanguineous marriage, incomplete bladder emptying, frequent voiding,  gender, history of urinary tract infection, and surgery in the past. The best MLT  algorithm for the prediction of enuresis was determined as logistic regression  algorithm. The total accuracy rate of the model in prediction was 81.3%.  CONCLUSION:  MLT might provide a faster and easier evaluation process for studies  on enuresis with a large dataset. The model in this study may suggest that  selected variables with high feature values could be preferred with priority in  any screening studies for enuresis. MLT may prevent clinical errors due to human  cognitive biases and may help the physicians to be proactive in diagnosis and  treatment of enuresis.

There has been not only a decrease in the number of births and an  increase in the percentage of older people, but also an increase in the number of  people living alone. There is growing demand for specialist medical care and  daily care with the number of people who can act as caregivers reducing. The use  of assistive robots can, at least partially, solve these problems. OBJECTIVE: The  purpose of this study was to examine the opinions of future health care  professionals (medical and nursing students) regarding the use of assistive  robots in the care of older people. METHODS: The study was conducted with a group  of 178 students from Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznań, Poland (110  nursing students and 68 medical students), using the Users' Needs, Requirements,  and Abilities Questionnaire. RESULTS: The participants of this study believed  that assistive robots should, first of all, remind older people to take  medication regularly, ensure their safety, monitor their health status and  environment, provide cognitive training, and encourage them to maintain physical  activity. In the students' opinion, the robot should not be an older person's  companion but only act as an assistant. Nursing students had significantly higher  scores than medical students in several statements concerning everyday use of  robots, including reminding about meals (P=.03), monitoring the environment  (P=.001), providing advice about a healthy diet (P=.04), monitoring the intake of  food and fluids (P=.02), and automatic "switch on" function (P=.02). Nursing  students were more focused on the social functions of robots, including  encouraging contact with friends (P=.003) and reducing the sense of loneliness  and improving mood (P=.008). Medical students were more aware of privacy issues  in the statement concerning the possibility of switching off the robot in  specific situations (P=.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed a generally positive  attitude of future doctors and nurses toward assistive robots, which can have an  impact on their acceptance by older adults. In the future, medical professionals  could help their patients to choose the right robots (and necessary functions)  that are best suited to their needs. However, this would require expanding the  curriculum to include the issues of gerontechnology.

T2  - Clinical interventions in aging
AB  - Promoting health and prolonging independence in the home is a priority for older adults, caregivers, clinicians, and society at large. Rapidly developing robotics  technology provides a platform for interventions, with the fields of physically  and socially assistive robots expanding in recent years. However, less attention  has been paid to using robots to enhance the cognitive health of older adults.  The goal of this review is to synthesize the current literature on home-based  cognitively assistive robots (CAR) in older adults without dementia and to  provide suggestions to improve the quality of the scientific evidence in this  subfield. First, we set the stage for CAR by: a) introducing the field of  robotics to improve health, b) summarizing evidence emphasizing the importance of  home-based interventions for older adults, c) reviewing literature on robot  acceptability in older adults, d) highlighting important ethical issues in  healthcare robotics, and e) reviewing current findings on socially assistive  robots, with a focus on translating findings to the CAR context. With this  foundation in place, we then review the literature on CAR, identifying gaps and  limitations of current evidence, and proposing future directions for research. We  conclude that CAR is promising and feasible and that there is a need for more  methodologically rigorous evaluations of CAR to promote prolonged home-based  independence in older adults.

T2  - The Journal of asthma : official journal of the Association for the Care of Asthma
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Acute exacerbations contribute significantly to the morbidity of asthma. Recent studies have shown that early detection and treatment of asthma  exacerbations leads to improved outcomes. We aimed to develop a machine learning  algorithm to detect severe asthma exacerbations using easily available daily  monitoring data. METHODS: We analyzed daily peak expiratory flow and symptom  scores recorded by participants in the SAKURA study (NCT00839800), an  international multicentre randomized controlled trial comparing  budesonide/formoterol as maintenance and reliever therapy versus  budesonide/formoterol maintenance plus terbutaline as reliever, in adults with  persistent asthma. The dataset consisted of 728,535 records of daily monitoring  data in 2010 patients, with 576 severe exacerbation events. Data post-processing  techniques included normalization, standardization, calculation of differences or  slopes over time and the use of smoothing filters. Principal components analysis  was used to reduce the large number of derived variables to a smaller number of  linearly independent components. Logistic regression, decision tree, naïve Bayes,  and perceptron algorithms were evaluated. Model accuracy was assessed using  stratified cross-validation. The primary outcome was the detection of  exacerbations on the same day or up to three days in the future. RESULTS: The  best model used logistic regression with input variables derived from  post-processed data using principal components analysis. This had an area under  the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.85, with a sensitivity of 90%  and specificity of 83% for severe asthma exacerbations. CONCLUSION: Asthma  exacerbations may be detected using machine learning algorithms applied to daily  self-monitoring of peak expiratory flow and asthma symptoms.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To test the effects of deploying a humanoid companion robot (Kabochan) in comparison with usual care for long-term care facilities' residents  with dementia. DESIGN: A 2-arm, randomized controlled trial with ABAB withdrawal  design, lasting 32 weeks. After an 8-week baseline period, Kabochan was  introduced in a nonfacilitated, individual approach with experimental-group  participants (n = 52) for 8 weeks, then removed for 8 weeks, and then  reintroduced for another 8 weeks. The control group (n = 51) received the usual  standardized care. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Seven long-term care facilities in  Hong Kong. 103 residents (76% women, 87.2 ± 7.4 years) with a clinical diagnosis  of dementia. MEASURES: Outcome assessments occurred at 5 time points: baseline  (week 1) and the end of each phase (weeks 8, 16, 24, and 32). Primary outcomes  were assessed with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (symptom severity  and caregiver distress subscales) and the Geriatric Depression Scale; secondary  outcomes were measured by the Hong Kong Montreal Cognitive Assessment 5-minute  Protocol, the Modified Barthel Index for Activities of Daily Living, and the  Quality of Life-Alzheimer's disease scale. RESULTS: A multivariate analysis of  variance indicated a statistically significant group × time interaction for  neuropsychiatric-related caregiver distress at week 16 (F = 6.72, P = .011), with  a moderate effect size (η(p)(2) = 0.06). When Kabochan was removed in the  withdrawal phase (weeks 17-24), the neuropsychiatric symptoms became more severe  at week 24 for the intervention group (F = 4.68, P = .003), although the effect  size was small to moderate (η(p)(2) = 0.04). No statistical between-group  differences were found in other health outcomes. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS:  The Kabochan was potentially effective at reducing short-term neuropsychiatric  symptoms and relevant caregiver distress for residents with dementia. An  individualized care plan with continuous monitoring is required to integrate the  humanoid robot into routine dementia care.

TI  - Robot companion cats for people at home with dementia: A qualitative case study on companotics.
AU  - Pike, Joanne
AU  - Picking, Richard
AU  - Cunningham, Stuart
T2  - Dementia (London, England)
AB  - The use of robot companion pets for people in care homes has been extensively studied. The results are largely positive and suggest that they are valuable in  enhancing wellbeing, communication and behavioural aspects. However, there has  been little research in people's own homes, possibly due to the cost and  complexity of some of the robot pets currently available. As dementia affects  people in different ways, this study explores the effects of a robot cat for  people in their own homes, without specifically investigating the effects on a  particular symptom. We utilised a case study design to investigate the  proposition that various factors influence the impact of a robot cat on the  person living with dementia and their carer, including acceptability of the robot  pet and acceptance of dementia and its symptoms. The qualitative analysis  explores the similarities and differences within the data which were gathered  during interviews with people with dementia and their families. This analysis  revealed four themes: Distraction, Communication, Acceptance and rejection, and  Connecting with the cat and connecting with others. These themes were synthesised  into two overarching themes: the effect of the cat on mood and behaviour, and The  interaction with the cat. We present the acceptability and impact of the robot  cat on symptoms of dementia, with data presented across and within the group of  participants. Our analysis suggests that benefits of the robot pet were evident,  and although this was a small-scale study, where they were accepted, robot pets  provided positive outcomes for the participants and their families.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Netherlands is currently investigating the feasibility of moving from fee-for-service to prospective payments for home healthcare, which would  require a suitable case-mix system. In 2017, health insurers mandated a  preliminary case-mix system as a first step towards generating information on  client differences in relation to care use. Home healthcare providers have also  increasingly adopted standardized nursing terminology (SNT) as part of their  electronic health records (EHRs), providing novel data for predictive modelling.  OBJECTIVE: To explore the predictive potential of SNT data for improvement of the  existing preliminary Dutch case-mix classification for home healthcare  utilization. METHODS: We extracted client-level data from the EHRs of a large  home healthcare provider, including data from the existing Dutch case-mix system,  SNT data (specifically, NANDA-I) and the hours of home healthcare provided. We  evaluated the predictive accuracy of the case-mix system and the SNT data  separately, and combined, using the machine learning algorithm Random Forest.  RESULTS: The case-mix system had a predictive performance of 22.4%  cross-validated R-squared and 6.2% cross-validated Cumming's Prediction Measure  (CPM). Adding SNT data led to a substantial relative improvement in predicting  home healthcare hours, yielding 32.1% R-squared and 15.4% CPM. DISCUSSION: The  existing preliminary Dutch case-mix system distinguishes client needs to some  degree, but not sufficiently. The results indicate that routinely collected SNT  data contain sufficient additional predictive value to warrant further research  for use in case-mix system design.

AB  - AIM: To explore how an AV1 telepresence robot helps school-aged children and adolescents with cancer to remain socially and academically connected with their  school classes during cancer treatment. DESIGN: Qualitative pilot study. METHODS:  Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with school-aged children  and adolescents (N = 3, 12-14 years) diagnosed with cancer, their parents  (N = 3), teachers (N = 2), classmates (12-14 years, N = 15, focus group  interviews) and healthcare professionals (N = 4). Participant observation was  performed in the child or adolescents' homes and in the classrooms during  education participation via an AV1 telepresence robot. RESULTS: Five themes  emerged: expectations, sociality, learning, spatiality and technology.  Participants experienced the robots as facilitating social interaction processes  with classmates and inclusion in learning activities, reducing their sense of  loneliness and lacking behind educationally. Nevertheless, multiple factors  determine whether the robot is perceived as exclusive, including the technical  functionality of the robot, spatiality in the classroom and mutual expectations  of the parties involved.

AB  - The number of people in need of long-term care is rising and personnel scarcity is already foreseeable. The shortage of caregivers is further increased due to  early retirement attributed to the major health burden when working at high speed  with heavy lifting. Since nursing staff in many cases work beyond their physical  strain limits during routine activities at the bed and existing systems do not  counteract the current trend, we investigate with the present work whether the  concept of a collaborative robotic support system can contribute to the physical  relief of the nursing staff to make it possible to fall below the physical strain  limits.

TI  - Significant challenges when introducing care robots in Swedish elder care.
AU  - Johansson-Pajala, Rose-Marie
AU  - Gustafsson, Christine
T2  - Disability and rehabilitation. Assistive technology
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Care robots are machines, operating partly or completely autonomously, that are intended to assist older people and their caregivers. Care  robots are seen as one part of the solution to the aging population, allowing  fewer professional caregivers to provide the necessary assistance and care.  Despite the potential benefits, the dissemination of care robots, and welfare  technology in general, is limited in Swedish elder care. PURPOSE: To explore the  challenges of introducing welfare technology, particularly care robots, in elder  care. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-one individual interviews with key actors at  the societal level, analysed by thematic analysis. RESULTS: The challenges, from  the societal actors' perspectives, were related to; the beliefs in technology,  attitudes, ethics, collaboration, and the need for knowledge and skills regarding  care robots (individual and group challenges). Challenges of a national character  were: national governance, infrastructure, laws and regulations, economics, and  procurement (systemic and societal challenges). In addition, the necessary  preconditions for successful introduction were revealed as: the utility of the  technology, implementation, evaluation and safety, security, and integrity  (preconditional challenges). CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of care robots in  elder care services seems to be more challenging than that of welfare technology  in general, given the context and prevailing attitudes and preconceptions about  robotics. Significant challenges need to be managed, at all levels of the  society, before care robots can become an integral part of daily care and assist  older people and their caregivers in activities and rehabilitation.IMPLICATION  FOR REHABILITATIONThe challenges described by the societal actors', are partly  similar to those of the end users', in terms of attitudes, ethics, knowledge and  skills, and collaboration. This consensus should provide a solid foundation for  the conceptualization and introduction of care robots in elderly care.The  challenges follow the pattern of an ecosystem involving all sections of society,  which are intertwined and require consideration before the expected benefits can  be realised.A user-centred approach is necessary to support the design,  implementation, and usefulness of care robots and their suitability for meeting  the real needs of older persons and professional caregivers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent advancements in wearable sensor technology have shown the feasibility of remote physical therapy at home. In particular, the current  COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the need and opportunity of internet-based  wearable technology in future health care systems. Previous research has shown  the feasibility of human activity recognition technologies for monitoring  rehabilitation activities in home environments; however, few comprehensive  studies ranging from development to clinical evaluation exist. OBJECTIVE: This  study aimed to (1) develop a home-based rehabilitation (HBR) system that can  recognize and record the type and frequency of rehabilitation exercises conducted  by the user using a smartwatch and smartphone app equipped with a machine  learning (ML) algorithm and (2) evaluate the efficacy of the home-based  rehabilitation system through a prospective comparative study with chronic stroke  survivors. METHODS: The HBR system involves an off-the-shelf smartwatch, a  smartphone, and custom-developed apps. A convolutional neural network was used to  train the ML algorithm for detecting home exercises. To determine the most  accurate way for detecting the type of home exercise, we compared accuracy  results with the data sets of personal or total data and accelerometer,  gyroscope, or accelerometer combined with gyroscope data. From March 2018 to  February 2019, we conducted a clinical study with two groups of stroke survivors.  In total, 17 and 6 participants were enrolled for statistical analysis in the HBR  group and control group, respectively. To measure clinical outcomes, we performed  the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Upper Extremity,  grip power test, Beck Depression Inventory, and range of motion (ROM) assessment  of the shoulder joint at 0, 6, and 12 months, and at a follow-up assessment 6  weeks after retrieving the HBR system. RESULTS: The ML model created with  personal data involving accelerometer combined with gyroscope data (5590/5601,  99.80%) was the most accurate compared with accelerometer (5496/5601, 98.13%) or  gyroscope data (5381/5601, 96.07%). In the comparative study, the drop-out rates  in the control and HBR groups were 40% (4/10) and 22% (5/22) at 12 weeks and 100%  (10/10) and 45% (10/22) at 18 weeks, respectively. The HBR group (n=17) showed a  significant improvement in the mean WMFT score (P=.02) and ROM of flexion  (P=.004) and internal rotation (P=.001). The control group (n=6) showed a  significant change only in shoulder internal rotation (P=.03). CONCLUSIONS: This  study found that a home care system using a commercial smartwatch and ML model  can facilitate participation in home training and improve the functional score of  the WMFT and shoulder ROM of flexion and internal rotation in the treatment of  patients with chronic stroke. This strategy can possibly be a cost-effective tool  for the home care treatment of stroke survivors in the future.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to explore whether features of recorded and transcribed audio communication data extracted by machine learning algorithms can  be used to train a classifier for anxiety. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used a  secondary data set generated by a clinical trial examining problem-solving  therapy for hospice caregivers consisting of 140 transcripts of multiple,  sequential conversations between an interviewer and a family caregiver along with  standardized assessments of anxiety prior to each session; 98 of these  transcripts (70%) served as the training set, holding the remaining 30% of the  data for evaluation. RESULTS: A classifier for anxiety was developed relying on  language-based features. An 86% precision, 78% recall, 81% accuracy, and 84%  specificity were achieved with the use of the trained classifiers. High anxiety  inflections were found among recently bereaved caregivers and were usually  connected to issues related to transitioning out of the caregiving role. This  analysis highlighted the impact of lowering anxiety by increasing reciprocity  between interviewers and caregivers. CONCLUSION: Verbal communication can provide  a platform for machine learning tools to highlight and predict behavioral health  indicators and trends.

TI  - Recognition, collaboration and community: science fiction representations of robot carers in Robot & Frank, Big Hero 6 and Humans.
AU  - Teo, Yugin
T2  - Medical humanities
AB  - In the 2010s, a small number of science fiction films and television series exploring the theme of the robot carer and how humans respond to them were  released. This paper explores three works in this regard: the films Robot & Frank  (dir. Jake Schreier, USA 2012), Big Hero 6 (dir. Don Hall/Chris Williams, USA  2014) and the television series Humans (UK/USA, Channel 4/AMC, 2015-2018).  Examining these works with some of the ethical issues currently being discussed  in the use of robot technology in care work, this paper demonstrates how they  align themselves with, but also challenge some of these ideas, and ultimately  direct viewers to consider their own expectations of personalised healthcare. The  essay begins by examining the fears of the care industry deploying robots to  replace the work of human carers, followed by a discussion of the effectiveness  of robots as carers as depicted in these fictional representations, and the final  section considers the social environment that these robot carers are situated in,  and how the robots become a reflection of human lives and a repository of  memories of affective relations. These texts suggest alternate ways of thinking  about human-robot interactions and care work, advocating for a more mutually  dependent and reciprocal working relationship that might lead to a better quality  of care.

AB  - Purpose: Innovative assistive technology can address aging-in-place and caregiving needs of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related dementia  (ADRD). The purpose of this study was to beta-test a novel socially assistive  robot (SAR) with a cohort of ADRD caregivers and gather their perspectives on its  potential integration in the home context.Methods: The SAR involved a  programmable research robot linked with commercially available Internet of things  sensors to receive and respond to care recipient's behaviour. Eight caregivers  observed the SAR perform two care protocols concerning the care recipient's daily  routine and home safety, and then participated in a focus group and phone  interview. The researchers used grounded theory and the Unified Theory of  Acceptance and Use of Technology as a framework to gather and analyse the  data.Results: The caregivers' asserted the potential of the SAR to relieve care  burden and envisioned it as a next-generation technology for caregivers. Adoption  of the SAR, as an identified theme, was subject to the SAR's navigability, care  recipient engagement, adaptability, humanoid features, and interface design. In  contrast, barriers leading to potential rejection were technological complexity,  system failure, exasperation of burden, and failure to address digital  divide.Conclusion: From a broader outlook, success of SARs as a home-health  technology for ADRD is reliant on the timing of their integration, commercial  viability, funding provisions, and their bonding with the care recipient.  Long-term research in the home settings is required to verify the usability and  impact of SARs in mediating aging-in-place of individuals with ADRD.IMPLICATIONS  FOR REHABILITATIONSocially assistive robots (SARs), an emerging domain of  assistive technology, are projected to have a crucial role in supporting  aging-in-place of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related dementia  (ADRD).Caregivers of individuals with ADRD who observed and interacted with a  novel SAR asserted their acceptance of the technology as well as its scope and  feasibility for the upcoming generation of caregivers.Navigability, care  recipient engagement, adaptability, humanoid features, and interface design were  stated to be critical factors for SAR's acceptance by caregiver and care  recipient dyads.In contrast, technological complexity, system failure,  exasperation of burden, and failure to address digital divide are detrimental to  SAR's adoption.Several design and implementation requirements must be considered  towards the full-scale development and deployment of the SARs in the home  context.

AB  - Over the past few years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has been greatly developed with one instance being smart home devices gradually entering into people's  lives. To maximize the impact of such deployments, home-based activity  recognition is required to initially recognize behaviors within smart home  environments and to use this information to provide better health and social care  services. Activity recognition has the ability to recognize people's activities  from the information about their interaction with the environment collected by  sensors embedded within the home. In this paper, binary data collected by  anonymous binary sensors such as pressure sensors, contact sensors, passive  infrared sensors etc. are used to recognize activities. A radial basis function  neural network (RBFNN) with localized stochastic-sensitive autoencoder (LiSSA)  method is proposed for the purposes of home-based activity recognition. An  autoencoder (AE) is introduced to extract useful features from the binary sensor  data by converting binary inputs into continuous inputs to extract increased  levels of hidden information. The generalization capability of the proposed  method is enhanced by minimizing both the training error and the stochastic  sensitivity measure in an attempt to improve the ability of the classifier to  tolerate uncertainties in the sensor data. Four binary home-based activity  recognition datasets including OrdonezA, OrdonezB, Ulster, and activities of  daily living data from van Kasteren (vanKasterenADL) are used to evaluate the  effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared with well-known benchmarking  approaches including support vector machine (SVM), multilayer perceptron neural  network (MLPNN), random forest and an RBFNN-based method, the proposed method  yielded the best performance with 98.35%, 86.26%, 96.31%, 92.31% accuracy on four  datasets, respectively.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rare neurodegenerative disease that is characterised by the rapid degeneration of upper and lower motor  neurons and has a fatal trajectory 3-4 years from symptom onset. Due to the  nature of the condition patients with ALS require the assistance of informal  caregivers whose task is demanding and can lead to high feelings of burden. This  study aims to predict caregiver burden and identify related features using  machine learning techniques. DESIGN: This included demographic and socioeconomic  information, quality of life, anxiety and depression questionnaires, for patients  and carers, resource use of patients and clinical information. The method used  for prediction was the Random forest algorithm. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This  study investigates a cohort of 90 patients and their primary caregiver at three  different time-points. The patients were attending the National ALS/Motor Neuron  Disease Multidisciplinary Clinic at Beaumont Hospital, Dublin. RESULTS: The  caregiver's quality of life and psychological distress were the most predictive  features of burden (0.92 sensitivity and 0.78 specificity). The most predictive  features for Clinical Decision Support model were associated with the weekly  caregiving duties of the primary caregiver as well as their age and health and  also the patient's physical functioning and age of onset. However, this model had  a lower sensitivity and specificity score (0.84 and 0.72, respectively). The  ability of patients without gastrostomy to cut food and handle utensils was also  highly predictive of burden in this study. Generally, our models are better in  predicting the high-risk category, and we suggest that information related to the  caregiver's quality of life and psychological distress is required. CONCLUSION:  This work demonstrates a proof of concept of an informatics solution to  identifying caregivers at risk of burden that could be incorporated into future  care pathways.

AB  - BACKGROUND: As artificial intelligence (AI) approaches in research increase and AI becomes more integrated into medicine, there is a need to understand  perspectives from members of the Canadian public and medical community. The aim  of this project was to investigate current perspectives on ethical issues  surrounding AI in health care. METHODS: In this qualitative study, adult patients  with meningioma and their caregivers were recruited consecutively (August  2018-February 2019) from a neurosurgical clinic in Toronto. Health care providers  caring for these patients were recruited through snowball sampling. Based on a  nonsystematic literature search, we constructed 3 vignettes that sought  participants' views on hypothetical issues surrounding potential AI applications  in health care. The vignettes were presented to participants in interviews, which  lasted 15-45 minutes. Responses were transcribed and coded for concepts,  frequency of response types and larger concepts emerging from the interview.  RESULTS: We interviewed 30 participants: 18 patients, 7 caregivers and 5 health  care providers. For each question, a variable number of responses were recorded.  The majority of participants endorsed nonconsented use of health data but  advocated for disclosure and transparency. Few patients and caregivers felt that  allocation of health resources should be done via computerized output, and a  majority stated that it was inappropriate to delegate such decisions to a  computer. Almost all participants felt that selling health data should be  prohibited, and a minority stated that less privacy is acceptable for the goal of  improving health. Certain caveats were identified, including the desire for  deidentification of data and use within trusted institutions. INTERPRETATION: In  this preliminary study, patients and caregivers reported a mixture of hopefulness  and concern around the use of AI in health care research, whereas providers were  generally more skeptical. These findings provide a point of departure for  institutions adopting health AI solutions to consider the ethical implications of  this work by understanding stakeholders' perspectives.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Informal caregivers report substantial burden and depressive symptoms which predict higher rates of patient institutionalization. While caregiver  education interventions may reduce caregiver distress and decrease the use of  long-term institutional care, evidence is mixed. Inconsistent findings across  studies may be the result of reporting average treatment effects which do not  account for how effects differ by participant characteristics. We apply a  machine-learning approach to randomized clinical trial (RCT) data of the Helping  Invested Family Members Improve Veteran's Experiences Study (HI-FIVES)  intervention to explore how intervention effects vary by caregiver and patient  characteristics. METHODS: We used model-based recursive partitioning models.  Caregivers of community-residing older adult US veterans with functional or  cognitive impairment at a single VA Medical Center site were randomized to  receive HI-FIVES (n = 118) vs. usual care (n = 123). The outcomes included  cumulative days not in the community and caregiver depressive symptoms assessed  at 12 months post intervention. Potential moderating characteristics were:  veteran age, caregiver age, caregiver ethnicity and race, relationship  satisfaction, caregiver burden, perceived financial strain, caregiver depressive  symptoms, and patient risk score. RESULTS: The effect of HI-FIVES on days not at  home was moderated by caregiver burden (p < 0.001); treatment effects were higher  for caregivers with a Zarit Burden Scale score ≤ 28. Caregivers with lower  baseline Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD-10) scores (≤ 8)  had slightly lower CESD-10 scores at follow-up (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Family  caregiver education interventions may be less beneficial for highly burdened and  distressed caregivers; these caregivers may require a more tailored approach that  involves assessing caregiver needs and developing personalized approaches.

AB  - Recent studies show that the elderly population has increased considerably in European society in recent years. This fact has led the European Union and many  countries to propose new policies for caring services directed to this group. The  current trend is to promote the care of the elderly in their own homes, thus  avoiding inverting resources on residences. With this in mind, there are now new  solutions in this direction, which try to make use of the continuous advances in  computer science. This paper tries to advance in this area by proposing the use  of a personal assistant to help older people at home while carrying out their  daily activities. The proposed personal assistant is called ME(3)CA, and can be  described as a cognitive assistant that offers users a personalised exercise plan  for their rehabilitation. The system consists of a sensorisation platform along  with decision-making algorithms paired with emotion detection models. ME(3)CA  detects the users' emotions, which are used in the decision-making process  allowing for more precise suggestions and an accurate (and unbiased) knowledge  about the users' opinion towards each exercise.

AB  - Purpose: Several case series have demonstrated the safety and feasibility of outpatient robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) in well-selected patients;  however, the patient perspective of this practice has not been well explored. In  this study, we explored patients' perspectives on the potential barriers and  benefits of outpatient RARP. Materials and Methods: We developed a  multidimensional questionnaire to assess socioeconomic status, presence of  caretaker at home, preferred transportation to the emergency room in case of  chest pain or postsurgical complications, readiness for discharge at  postanesthesia care unit (PACU), and potential barriers for discharge. In  addition, patients were asked to provide an estimate of overnight hospitalization  costs and their willingness to pay out-of-pocket expenses for their overnight  stay. Patients who underwent RARP between August 1, 2018, and April 30, 2019,  were asked to fill the questionnaire within the first week following their  operation. Results: During our study, 157/292 (53.8%) of men undergoing RARP from  a single high-volume robotic surgeon completed the survey. Patients who completed  <80% of the survey (n = 5) were excluded from the final analysis. Thirty-seven  (24.3%) patients felt that they would have been ready for discharge immediately  from PACU, and 48 (31.6%) patients after extended recovery and before midnight.  Only 17.8% (n = 27) of the patients claim that they experienced a medical  intervention in the hospital that could not have been managed at home. The main  barriers for same-day discharge were pain (55.9%, 80/143), catheter discomfort  (44.7%, 64/143), insufficient education about catheter care (31.4%, 45/143),  postoperative nausea and vomiting (15.3%, 22/143), and medical complications  (13.2%, 19/143). Conclusions: Two-thirds of patients following RARP did not feel  ready to be discharged on the day of their surgery. Further research is necessary  to identify patients who may benefit from this approach to reduce health care  costs while minimizing patient postoperative morbidity.

AB  - With Taiwan now an "aged society", home safety for older individuals has become a very important issue. The purpose of establishing early warning systems in homes  and/or communities is to generate and disseminate meaningful warning information  to medical institutions or rescue units in a timely manner so that they may take  timely and appropriate action. The main purpose of this paper is to introduce the  current application of information and communication technology (ICT, especially  the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence) in early warning systems for  home and community care. Two approaches to developing these systems are  introduced: instant detection and prevention monitoring. Instant detection  facilitates fall detection and personnel tracking, while the focus of prevention  monitoring is on preventing falls and physiological status monitoring. The  challenges faced by in incorporating ICT into these early monitoring systems are  discussed as well.

AB  - Home hospitalization (HH) is presented as a healthcare alternative capable of providing high standards of care when patients no longer need hospital  facilities. Although HH seems to lower healthcare costs by shortening hospital  stays and improving patient's quality of life, the lack of continuous observation  at home may lead to complications in some patients. Since blood tests have been  proven to provide relevant prognosis information in many diseases, this paper  analyzes the impact of different sampling methods on the prediction of HH  outcomes. After a first exploratory analysis, some variables extracted from  routine blood tests performed at the moment of HH admission, such as hemoglobin,  lymphocytes or creatinine, were found to unmask statistically significant  differences between patients undergoing successful and unsucessful HH stays.  Then, predictive models were built with these data, in order to identify  unsuccessful cases eventually needing hospital facilities. However, since these  hospital admissions during HH programs are rare, their identification through  conventional machine-learning approaches is challenging. Thus, several sampling  strategies designed to face class imbalance were herein overviewed and compared.  Among the analyzed approaches, over-sampling strategies, such as ROSE (Random  Over-Sampling Examples) and conventional random over-sampling, showed the best  performances. Nevertheless, further improvements should be proposed in the future  so as to better identify those patients not benefiting from HH.

AB  - Among elderly populations over the world, a high percentage of individuals are affected by physical or mental diseases, greatly influencing their quality of  life. As it is a known fact that they wish to remain in their own home for as  long as possible, solutions must be designed to detect these diseases  automatically, limiting the reliance on human resources. To this end, our team  developed a sensors platform based on infrared proximity sensors to accurately  recognize basic bathroom activities such as going to the toilet and showering.  This article is based on the body of scientific literature which establish  evidences that activities relative to corporal hygiene are strongly correlated to  health status and can be important signs of the development of eventual  disorders. The system is built to be simple, affordable and highly reliable. Our  experiments have shown that it can yield an F-Score of 96.94%. Also, the  durations collected by our kit are approximately 6 seconds apart from the real  ones; those results confirm the reliability of our kit.

AB  - Alzheimer disease and other dementias have become the 7th cause of death worldwide. Still lacking a cure, an early detection of the disease in order to  provide the best intervention is crucial. To develop an assessment system for the  general public, speech analysis is the optimal solution since it reflects the  speaker's cognitive skills abundantly and data collection is relatively  inexpensive compared with brain imaging, blood testing, etc. While most of the  existing literature extracted statistics-based features and relied on a feature  selection process, we have proposed a novel Feature Sequence representation and  utilized a data-driven approach, namely, the recurrent neural network to perform  classification in this study. The system is also shown to be fully-automated,  which implies the system can be deployed widely to all places easily. To validate  our study, a series of experiments have been conducted with 120 speech samples,  and the score in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic  curve is as high as 0.838.

AU  - Vandemeulebroucke, Tijs

T2  - Journal of medical ethics
AB  - Different embodiments of technology permeate all layers of public and private domains in society. In the public domain of aged care, attention is increasingly  focused on the use of socially assistive robots (SARs) supporting caregivers and  older adults to guarantee that older adults receive care. The introduction of  SARs in aged-care contexts is joint by intensive empirical and philosophical  research. Although these efforts merit praise, current empirical and  philosophical research are still too far separated. Strengthening the connection  between these two fields is crucial to have a full understanding of the ethical  impact of these technological artefacts. To bridge this gap, we propose a  philosophical-ethical framework for SAR use, one that is grounded in the dialogue  between empirical-ethical knowledge about and philosophical-ethical reflection on  SAR use. We highlight the importance of considering the intuitions of older  adults and their caregivers in this framework. Grounding philosophical-ethical  reflection in these intuitions opens the ethics of SAR use in aged care to its  own socio-historical contextualisation. Referring to the work of Margaret Urban  Walker, Joan Tronto and Andrew Feenberg, it is argued that this socio-historical  contextualisation of the ethics of SAR use already has strong philosophical  underpinnings. Moreover, this contextualisation enables us to formulate a  rudimentary decision-making process about SAR use in aged care which rests on  three pillars: (1) stakeholders' intuitions about SAR use as sources of  knowledge; (2) interpretative dialogues as democratic spaces to discuss the  ethics of SAR use; (3) the concretisation of ethics in SAR use.

AB  - With the paradigm shift from hospital-centric healthcare to home-centric healthcare in Healthcare 4.0, healthcare robotics has become one of the fastest  growing fields of robotics. The combination of robot capabilities with human  intelligence, for example, telerobotics for home care, is gradually showing  promising potentials. In this paper, the Home-TeleBot system, a generalized  IoT-enabled telerobotic architecture designed to support home-centric healthcare  system, is proposed. In particular, the implementation of it is realized by  integrating human-motion-capture subsystem with robot-control subsystem. The  dual-arm cooperative robot, YuMi, imitates human motion captured by a set of  wearable inertial motion capture devices to complete tasks. The proposed approach  using workspace mapping and path planning of robot manipulators, facilitates  telerobot to execute tasks in a natural and human-like way. Based on the constant  of proportionality calculated by comparing the human original workspace with the  robot original workspace, the workspace mapping is achieved by making assumptions  of the distance between end-effectors (human hands, robot's grippers) and  shoulders. Additionally, robot manipulators' path is planned by setting virtual  obstacles to constrain robot motion, which aims to improve the performance of  robot's human-like motion. As a specific example of application, we apply the  proposed architecture to a fetching task based on dual-arm motion capture and  mapping for telerobotics in home care.

AB  - Purpose: Treatment of pediatric cancers and hematological malignancies requires long periods of isolation in a sterile room. To promote family connections,  telepresence robots have been made available in the homes of hospitalized  patients. Our aim was to evaluate the perceived benefits and difficulties  encountered by users and their families in terms of family dynamics. We also  evaluated the presence of the robot on the medical caregivers' therapeutic  relationship and organization of daily care. Methods: An observational study was  undertaken with semistructured face-to-face interviews of 17 patients (aged 7 to  25 years) and their parents conducted by a psychologist on day +15 after  provision of the robot and then after the patients had gone home, as well as  face-to-face interviews of 15 caregivers by a philosopher before the robots were  made available and at day +21. Results: One of the main perceived benefits  expressed by the patients was maintenance of a connection with their siblings and  retention of their role in the family. For parents, the device provided  reassurance of being able to stay in touch with their child. The nursing staff  indicated that the devices allowed them to develop more than a professional  relationship with the child and to interact with their extended family.  Limitations of the virtual nature of the nursing staff/family relationship were  also noted, such as potential frustration for patients when they witness things  that they cannot access and a degree of concern for the parents during periods of  disconnection. Conclusions: This study revealed an overall perceived benefit for  patients, their families, and caregivers. It also highlighted relevant issues and  it provides guidelines for broader application of such devices.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Novel developments in the robotics field have produced systems that can support person wheelchair transfers, maximize safety and reduce caregiver  burden. The purpose of this study was to identify and describe these systems,  their usability (or satisfaction), the context for which they have been or can be  used and how they have been evaluated to determine evidence for their  effectiveness. METHOD: Available research on Person Transfer Assist Systems  (PTAS) was systematically gathered using similar standards to the PRISMA  guidelines. The search terms were derived from common terms and via exploring  similar review articles. Initial search terms displayed 1330 articles and by  using the inclusion/exclusion criteria 96 articles were selected for abstract  review. After full- text reviewing 48 articles were included. RESULTS: 29  articles concerned research in robotic transfer systems, 10 articles used both  ceiling and floor-mounted lifts and 9 articles used only floor-mounted lifts as  an intervention/control group. The results of this analysis identified a few  usability evaluations for robotic transfer prototypes, especially ones comparing  prototypes to existing marketed devices. CONCLUSION: Robotic device research is a  recent development within assistive technology. Whilst usability evaluations  provided evidence that a robotic device will provide better service to the user,  the sample number of subjects used are minimal in comparison to any of the  intervention/control group articles. Experimental studies between PTASs are  required to support technological advancements. Caregiver injury risk has been  the focus for most of the comparison articles; however, few articles focus on the  implications to the person.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONCeiling mounted lifts  are preferred over floor-based lifts due to lower injury rates.Many robotic  transfer systems have been developed; however, there is a paucity of quantitative  and qualitative studies.Based on the results of this review, rehabilitation  settings are recommended to use ceiling over floor assist systems, and it is  recommended to provide training on using devices to assist with patient transfers  to lower the risk of injuries.

AB  - Behavior identification plays an important role in supporting homecare for the elderly living alone. In literature, plenty of algorithms have been designed to  identify behaviors of the elderly by learning features or extracting patterns  from sensor data. However, most of them adopted probabilistic models or  supervised learning to identify behaviors based on labeled sensor data. This  paper proposes a behavior identification algorithm (BIA) using unsupervised  learning based on unlabeled sensor data for the elderly living alone in smart  home. This paper presents the observation of elder behaviors with three features:  Event Order, Time Length Similarity and Time Interval Similarity features. Based  on these features of behavior observations, two properties of behaviors,  including the Event Shift and Histogram Shape Similarity properties, are  presented. According to these properties, the proposed BIA is developed. Finally,  performance results show that the proposed BIA outperforms the existing  unsupervised machine learning mechanisms in terms of the behavior identification  precision and recall.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This research is part of an international project to design and test a home-based healthcare robot to help older adults with mild cognitive impairment  (MCI) or early dementia. The aim was to investigate the perceived usefulness of  different daily-care activities for the robot, developed from previous research  on needs. DESIGN: Qualitative descriptive analysis using semistructured  interviews. Two studies were conducted. In the first study, participants watched  videos of a prototype robot performing daily-care activities; in the second  study, participants interacted with the robot itself. SETTING: Interviews were  conducted at a university and a retirement village. PARTICIPANTS: In study 1,  participants were nine experts in aged care and nine older adults living in an  aged care facility. In study 2, participants were 10 experts in aged care.  RESULTS: The themes that emerged included aspects of the robot's interactions,  potential benefits, the appearance, actions and humanness of the robot, ways to  improve its functionality and technical issues. Overall, the activities were  perceived as useful, especially the reminders and safety checks, with possible  benefits of companionship, reassurance and reduced caregiver burden. Suggestions  included personalising the robot to each individual, simplifying the language and  adding more activities. Technical issues still need to be fixed. CONCLUSION: This  study adds to knowledge about healthcare robots for people with MCI by developing  and testing a new robot with daily-care activities including safety checks. The  robot was seen to be potentially useful but needs to be tested with people with  MCI.

AB  - Falls are the leading cause of injuries among older adults, particularly in the more vulnerable home health care (HHC) population. Existing standardized fall  risk assessments often require supplemental data collection and tend to have low  specificity. We applied a random forest algorithm on readily available HHC data  from the mandated Outcomes and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) with over 100  items from 59,006 HHC patients to identify factors that predict and quantify fall  risks. Our ultimate goal is to build clinical decision support for fall  prevention. Our model achieves higher precision and balanced accuracy than the  commonly used multifactorial Missouri Alliance for Home Care fall risk  assessment. This is the first known attempt to determine fall risk factors from  the extensive OASIS data from a large sample. Our quantitative prediction of fall  risks can aid clinical discussions of risk factors and prevention strategies for  lowering fall incidence.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Older individuals receiving home assistance are at high risk for emergency visits and unplanned hospitalization. Anticipating their health  difficulties could prevent these events. This study investigated the  effectiveness of an at-home monitoring method using social workers' observations  to predict risk for 7- and 14-day emergency department (ED) visits. METHODS: This  was a prospective cohort study of persons ≥75 years, living at home and receiving  assistance from home care aides (HCA) at 6 French facilities. After each home  visit, HCAs reported on participants' functional status using a smartphone  application that recorded 27 functional items about each participant (e.g.,  ability to stand, move, eat, mood, loneliness). We recorded ED visits. Finally,  we used machine learning techniques (i.e., leveraging random forest predictors)  to develop a 7- and 14-day predictive algorithm for the risk of ED visit.  RESULTS: The study included 301 participants, and the HCA made 9,987  observations. Over the mean 10-month follow-up, 97 participants (32%) had at  least one ED visit. Modeling techniques identified 9 contributory factors from  the longitudinal records of the HCA and developed a predictive algorithm for the  risk of ED visit. The predictive performance (i.e., the area under the ROC curve)  was 0.70 at 7 days and 0.67 at 14 days. INTERPRETATION: For frail elders  receiving in-home care, information on functional status collected by HCA helps  predict the risk of ED visits 7 to 14 days in advance. A survey system for  real-time identification of risks could be developed using this exploratory work.

AB  - Our research team has developed two versions of an ankle robot for children with cerebral palsy. Both devices provide three degrees of freedom and are connected  to an airplane video game. The child uses his/her foot as the controller for the  plane and attempts to fly through a series of hoops arranged to manipulate the  foot across the ankle joint. The first device is for lab-based therapy and four  children have completed 20 sessions each with the device. The second device is  for home-based therapy and two children have completed a 28-day trial using the  device at home. Both studies were done under Institutional Review Board approval  and all participants improved ankle range of motion. Further studies are ongoing  to gather more data and validate the results.

AB  - We conducted a pilot study to evaluate the accuracy of a custom built non-contactpressure-sensitive device in diagnosing obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)  severity as an alternative toin-laboratory polysomnography (PSG) and a Type 3  in-home sleep apnea test (HSAT). Fourteenpatients completed PSG sleep studies for  one night with simultaneous recording from ourload-cell-based sensing device in  the bed. Subjects subsequently installed pressure sensors in theirbed at home and  recorded signals for up to four nights. Machine learning models were optimized  toclassify sleep apnea severity using a standardized American Academy of Sleep  Medicine (AASM)scoring of the gold standard studies as reference. On a per-night  basis, our model reached a correctOSA detection rate of 82.9% (sensitivity =  88.9%, specificity = 76.5%), and OSA severity classificationaccuracy of 74.3%  (61.5% and 81.8% correctly classified in-clinic and in-home tests,  respectively).There was no difference in Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI) estimation  when subjects wore HSATsensors versus load cells (LCs) only (p-value = 0.62). Our  in-home diagnostic system providesan unobtrusive method for detecting OSA with  high sensitivity and may potentially be used forlong-term monitoring of breathing  during sleep. Further research is needed to address the lowerspecificity  resulting from using the highest AHI from repeated samples.

AB  - BACKGROUND: More than 70% of elderly people age 80 and older are experiencing problems in personal mobility. Assistive robotics can represent a concrete  support providing also a support for caregivers, clinicians and nurses by  reducing their burden. METHODS: A total of 20 older people and 34 caregivers  (formal and informal) were interviewed in Italy and the Netherlands to  investigate and prioritize their needs concerning the personal mobility domains  and their attitudes towards assistive robots. The data were analysed from a user  point of view by means of thematic content analysis by underlying recurrent  topics. RESULTS: The results revealed four categories of needs from the  perspective of the older individuals: instrumental needs, rehabilitation needs,  personal safety and indoor activities of daily life. Additionally, the results  underline how personal mobility issues influence different aspects of daily life.  Complementarily, three categories of caregiver needs were also distinguished:  instrumental needs, rehabilitation monitoring needs and checkup needs. The  highest percentage of participants showed a positive expectation towards  assistive robotics. CONCLUSIONS: The results were clustered according to the  robot abilities (i.e., motion, interaction, manipulation, decision support and  perception abilities) as a list of functional and technical requirements that  should be developed to address all the needs related to the personal mobility.  Robotic developer teams that work in this context could take advantage of this  research. Additionally, this work can be used as a basis for clinicians and  nurses working in geriatric units to understand how the robots can support and  enhance their work. Implications for rehabilitation The incidence of personal  mobility limitations affects 35% of adults age 70 and older and 72% of people  over 80 years of age. Assistive robots can support elderly people during daily  tasks: they could promote their personal mobility acting as a supporting tool.  The results of the needs analysis revealed four categories of needs from the  perspective of the older individuals: instrumental needs, rehabilitation needs,  personal safety, and indoor activities of daily life. Three categories of  caregiver needs were also distinguished: instrumental needs, rehabilitation  monitoring needs, and check-up needs.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Manual lifting can be burdensome for people who care for power wheelchair users. Although technologies used for dependent transfers are helpful,  they have shortcomings of their own. This study compares the usability and task  load demand of a novel robot-assisted transfer device to a clinical standard when  performing dependent transfers. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was conducted to  assess caregivers (N = 21) transferring a 56-kg mannequin with the Strong Arm and  Hoyer Advance at three transfer locations. Feedback was gathered through  qualitative surveys. RESULTS: Usability was significant in multiple areas  important for transfers. Caregiver fatigue and discomfort intensity were reduced,  and the Strong Arm was preferred at the three transfer locations. Device ease and  efficiency favored Strong Arm at two stations as was discomfort frequency. In  addition, physical demand, frustration, and effort were significantly lower using  Strong Arm compared with the Hoyer Advance. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the Hoyer,  participants favored Strong Arm for transfer usability and task load demand.  However, further Strong Arm developments are needed.

T2  - Journal of healthcare engineering
AB  - Population aging is increasingly serious. The application of social robots for home-based elder care is an important way to solve this problem. Aging adults'  demands for social robots' companionship affect robotic designs. This study aimed  to investigate aging adults' demands for social robots' companionship and  explored in which life situations it was appropriate to accompany aging adults by  social robots. This study involved three phases. Phase 1 (an interview survey)  collected the life situations in which aging adults lived alone at home. Based on  the results of Phase 1, Phase 2 (a questionnaire survey) investigated aging  adults' demands for companionship, whereas Phase 3 (an expert evaluation)  investigated the feasibility of the robots' companionship for aging adults. After  the three phases, this study compared aging adults' demands for companionship  with the feasibility of social robots' companionship in each life situation.  Based on the results, the life situations of dinning and watching TV, there was a  greater likelihood that the companionship that aging adults needed might be  provided by social robots. In the life situations of sleeping and short breaking,  it was difficult that aging adults' demands for companionship were fulfilled by  social robots. Implications were discussed for home-based elder care system.

T2  - Dementia and geriatric cognitive disorders
AB  - BACKGROUND: Socially assistive robots (SARs) have the potential to assist nonpharmacological interventions based on verbal communication to support the  care of persons with dementia (PwDs). However, establishing verbal communication  with a PwD is challenging. Thus, several authors have proposed strategies to  converse with PwDs. While these strategies have proved effective at enhancing  communication between PwDs and their caregivers, they have not been used or  tested in the domain of human-robot interaction. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to  assess the effectiveness of incorporating conversational strategies proposed in  the literature for caregivers, during PwD-robot interactions. METHODS: We  conducted a total of 23 group sessions based on music and conversation therapy,  where a SAR interacted with 12 PwDs (mean = 80.25 years) diagnosed with mild to  moderate-stage dementia. Using a single subject research approach, we designed an  AB study to assess the effectiveness of the conversational strategies in the  PwD-robot interaction. Our analysis focuses on the direct communication between  the PwDs and the robot, and the perceived enjoyment of PwDs. RESULTS: The number  of utterances made from a PwD to the robot increased significantly when the  conversational strategies were included in the robot. In addition, PwDs engaged  in more sustained conversations. Additionally, PwDs enjoyed conversing with the  robot Eva, as much as listening to music. These results indicate that the use of  these conversational strategies is -effective at increasing the interaction  between PwD and a SAR. CONCLUSIONS: PwDs who participated in the study engaged  and enjoyed the interaction with the SAR. The results provide evidence of the  importance of incorporating appropriate conversational strategies in SARs that  support interventions for the care and social stimulation of PwDs.

T2  - Journal of medical Internet research
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although vaccination rates are above the threshold for herd immunity in South Korea, a growing number of parents have expressed concerns about the  safety of vaccines. It is important to understand these concerns so that we can  maintain high vaccination rates. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop  a childhood vaccination ontology to serve as a framework for collecting and  analyzing social data on childhood vaccination and to use this ontology for  identifying concerns about and sentiments toward childhood vaccination from  social data. METHODS: The domain and scope of the ontology were determined by  developing competency questions. We checked if existing ontologies and conceptual  frameworks related to vaccination can be reused for the childhood vaccination  ontology. Terms were collected from clinical practice guidelines, research  papers, and posts on social media platforms. Class concepts were extracted from  these terms. A class hierarchy was developed using a top-down approach. The  ontology was evaluated in terms of description logics, face and content validity,  and coverage. In total, 40,359 Korean posts on childhood vaccination were  collected from 27 social media channels between January and December 2015.  Vaccination issues were identified and classified using the second-level class  concepts of the ontology. The sentiments were classified in 3 ways: positive,  negative or neutral. Posts were analyzed using frequency, trend, logistic  regression, and association rules. RESULTS: Our childhood vaccination ontology  comprised 9 superclasses with 137 subclasses and 431 synonyms for class,  attribute, and value concepts. Parent's health belief appeared in 53.21%  (15,709/29,521) of posts and positive sentiments appeared in 64.08%  (17,454/27,236) of posts. Trends in sentiments toward vaccination were affected  by news about vaccinations. Posts with parents' health belief, vaccination  availability, and vaccination policy were associated with positive sentiments,  whereas posts with experience of vaccine adverse events were associated with  negative sentiments. CONCLUSIONS: The childhood vaccination ontology developed in  this study was useful for collecting and analyzing social data on childhood  vaccination. We expect that practitioners and researchers in the field of  childhood vaccination could use our ontology to identify concerns about and  sentiments toward childhood vaccination from social data.

Using a  threshold logic unit to produce observation outcomes, the algorithm indicated  that while reliability was the crux of the service outcome, peripheral variables  (e.g., assurance, empathy, responsiveness, and tangibility) integrated emotions  and feelings into the hospice service process which equated to an increased  quality of life, a positive disconfirmation of expectations (service expectations  were met or exceeded) and a good death experience equating to a positive  perception of quality.

AB  - Social isolation is one of the most common consequences of older people with dementia, especially for those who live at their own dwellings alone due to  limited access to social activities. Research relating to the use of social  robots in aged care has increasing attention to facilitating the support to care  services for older people with dementia. Particularly less attention has focused  on the applicability of social robots in home care services. This paper aims to  study the engagement and robot experience of older people with dementia while  interacting with a social robot named Betty in the context of home-based care.  This paper contributes to the research relating to care service embedded robots  by expanding the knowledge regarding longitudinal research in home based care,  while there is limited long-term study in this context. The results show that  social robots are evident to be able to engage with older people with dementia at  home. Consequently, designing social robots in a social context is desirable.  While the robots enabled service for the human partner within the social context  is possible, there is a need to underpin the concept of personhood to realize  personalization of services and its contents to suit individual preferences.

AB  - The emerging demographic trends toward an aging population, demand new ways and solutions to improve the quality of elderly life. These include, prolonged  independent living, improved health care, and reduced social isolation. Recent  technological advances in the field of assistive robotics bring higher  sophistication and various assistive abilities that can help in achieving these  goals. In this paper, we present design and validation of a low-cost telepresence  robot that can assist the elderly and their professional caregivers, in everyday  activities. The developed robot structure and its control objectives were tested  in, both, a simulation and experimental environment. On-field experiments were  done in a private elderly care center involving elderly persons and caregivers as  participants. The goal of the evaluation study was to test the software  architecture and the robot capabilities for navigation, as well as the robot  manipulator. Moreover, participants' reactions toward a possible adoption of the  developed robot system in everyday activities were assessed. The obtained results  of the conducted evaluation study are also presented and discussed.

AB  - The irregularity detection of daily behaviors for the elderly is an important issue in homecare. Plenty of mechanisms have been developed to detect the health  condition of the elderly based on the explicit irregularity of several biomedical  parameters or some specific behaviors. However, few research works focus on  detecting the implicit irregularity involving the combination of diverse  behaviors, which can assess the cognitive and physical wellbeing of elders but  cannot be directly identified based on sensor data. This paper proposes an  Implicit IRregularity Detection (IIRD) mechanism that aims to detect the implicit  irregularity by developing the unsupervised learning algorithm based on daily  behaviors. The proposed IIRD mechanism identifies the distance and similarity  between daily behaviors, which are important features to distinguish the regular  and irregular daily behaviors and detect the implicit irregularity of elderly  health condition. Performance results show that the proposed IIRD outperforms the  existing unsupervised machine-learning mechanisms in terms of the detection  accuracy and irregularity recall.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of various rehabilitative interventions aimed at enhancing poststroke motor recovery by assessing their effectiveness  when compared with no treatment or placebo and their superiority when compared  with conventional training program (CTP). DATA SOURCE: A literature search was  based on 19 Cochrane reviews and 26 other reviews. We also updated the searches  in PubMed up to September 30, 2017. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized controlled trials  associated with 18 experimented training programs (ETP) were included if they  evaluated the effects of the programs on either upper extremity (UE) or lower  extremity (LE) motor recovery among adults within 6 months poststroke; included  ≥10 participants in each arm; and had an intervention duration of ≥10 consecutive  weekdays. DATA EXTRACTION: Four reviewers evaluated the eligibility and quality  of literature. Methodological quality was assessed using the PEDro scale. DATA  SYNTHESIS: Among the 178 included studies, 129 including 7450 participants were  analyzed in this meta-analysis. Six ETPs were significantly effective in  enhancing UE motor recovery, with the standard mean differences (SMDs) and 95%  confidence intervals outlined as follow: constraint-induced movement therapy  (0.82, 0.45-1.19), electrostimulation (ES)-motor (0.42, 0.22-0.63), mirror  therapy (0.71, 0.22-1.20), mixed approach (0.21, 0.01-0.41), robot-assisted  training (0.51, 0.22-0.80), and task-oriented training (0.57, 0.16-0.99). Six  ETPs were significantly effective in enhancing LE motor recovery:  body-weight-supported treadmill training (0.27, 0.01-0.52), caregiver-mediated  training (0.64, 0.20-1.08), ES-motor (0.55, 0.27-0.83), mixed approach (0.35,  0.15-0.54), mirror therapy (0.56, 0.13-1.00), and virtual reality (0.60,  0.15-1.05). However, compared with CTPs, almost none of the ETPs exhibited  significant SMDs for superiority. CONCLUSIONS: Certain experimented interventions  were effective in enhancing poststroke motor recovery, but little evidence  supported the superiority of experimented interventions over conventional  rehabilitation.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Technological solutions can support the elderly, improve their quality of life and reduce isolation and loneliness. The Euro-Japan ACCRA (Agile  Co-Creation for Robots and Aging) project has the objective of building a  reference co-creation methodology for the development of robotic solutions for  ageing. The aim of this study is to provide a pilot qualitative analysis of the  real needs of elderly people and their caregivers when exposed to conversational  activities with robots and to identify priority needs that should be developed  from end-user perspectives. METHODS: A qualitative research design was adopted to  define a pre-structured questionnaire that was administered to the elderly taking  part in the piloting sessions. Three groups of end-users were included: subjects  with an age ≥ 60 years, informal caregivers and formal caregivers. RESULTS: The  interviews were carried out in Italy and Japan. A total of 17 elderly and 36  caregivers were recruited. Common needs in the two sites were categorized into 3  groups: Communication; Emotion Detection and Safety. General robot acceptance  level is good and perception is positive among participants in the pilot sites.  CONCLUSION: A positive perception of the elderly on the application of a robotic  solution was found and many are the needs that could be addressed by an  appropriate and careful robotic development taking into account the real needs  and capabilities of the involved subjects.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Intravenous insertion (IVI) is a very common procedure in the emergency department (ED). IVI is often painful and stressful for both children  and their families. Currently, distraction therapy is not used as a standard of  care for IVI in North America. We propose that interaction with a humanoid robot  may effectively distract children during IVI thereby reducing their pain and  distress. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This randomised controlled superiority trial will  be conducted in a Canadian paediatric ED. We plan to recruit 80 patients.  Children will be eligible if they (1) are 6 to 11 years of age, (2) need an IVI,  (3) are fully conscious and alert, (4) have sufficient knowledge of the English  language to understand and complete the study assessments and (5) are accompanied  by a legal guardian. Our primary objective is to compare patient-reported pain  and distress with the use of distraction (via a humanoid robot) versus standard  care in children. The primary outcomes will be (1) self-reported pain, as  measured by the Faces Pain Scale-Revised and (2) observed distress, as measured  by the Observational Scale of Behavioural Distress-Revised. Secondary outcomes  will include (1) measuring parental anxiety, (2) examining the association  between parental anxiety and child outcomes and (3) children's degree of  engagement with the humanoid robot via the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory tool.  First enrolment occurred in April 2017 and is ongoing. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION:  This study has been approved by the Health Research Ethics Board (University of  Alberta). Informed consent to participate will be obtained from all participants'  parents/guardian, in conjunction with assent from the participant themselves.  This study data will be submitted for publication regardless of results. Purchase  of the robot was facilitated through a Stollery Children's Hospital Foundation  donation. Recruitment costs are supported by the Women and Children's Health  Research Institute. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT02997631; Pre-results.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To offer practical guidance to nurse investigators interested in multidisciplinary research that includes assisting in the development of  artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for "smart" health management and  aging-in-place. METHODS: Ten health-assistive Smart Homes were deployed to  chronically ill older adults from 2015 to 2018. Data were collected using five  sensor types (infrared motion, contact, light, temperature, and humidity). Nurses  used telehealth and home visitation to collect health data and provide ground  truth annotation for training intelligent algorithms using raw sensor data  containing health events. FINDINGS: Nurses assisting with the development of  health-assistive AI may encounter unique challenges and opportunities. We  recommend: (a) using a practical and consistent method for collecting field data,  (b) using nurse-driven measures for data analytics, (c) multidisciplinary  communication occur on an engineering-preferred platform. CONCLUSIONS: Practical  frameworks to guide nurse investigators integrating clinical data with sensor  data for training machine learning algorithms may build capacity for nurses to  make significant contributions to developing AI for health-assistive Smart Homes.

AB  - Background: The rapid development of new technologies has recently raised interest in the use of assistive robots in the care of older people. The success  or failure of robots' implementation is mediated by their acceptance by users.  The aim of the study was to answer the question of how both older people and  caregivers perceive the possibility of using an assistive robot for nutritional  support. Methods: Opinions of 252 respondents (126 older-aged 65 and above; 126  younger ones-aged below 65) from five European countries were collected using the  Users' Needs, Requirements, and Abilities Questionnaire. Results: The majority of  participants positively assessed the possibility of using a robot to improve the  diet of older people by giving advice on healthy eating or monitoring the amount  of food consumed by the owner. An age-related difference was observed, as older  people less frequently accepted the reminding of meal times or drinking liquids  than younger participants. Four key categories related to the robot's role in the  diet of older people were identified: matching the needs, robot's  characteristics, ethical issues and technical/financial issues. Conclusions: Our  preliminary research has shown a positive approach to robots in the context of  their nutrition-related aspects. An indication has been made of the need to  include older people and other stakeholders in the process of designing these  functionalities and modeling human⁻robot interactions based on communication  theories.

T2  - Nursing inquiry
AB  - The Smart Home designed to extend older adults independence is emerging as a clinical solution to the growing ageing population. Nurses will and should play a  key role in the development and application of Smart Home technology.  Accordingly, conceptual frameworks are needed for nurse scientists who are  collaborating with multidisciplinary research teams in developing an intelligent  Smart Home that assists with managing older adults' health. We present a  conceptual framework that is grounded in critical realism and pragmatism,  informing a unique mixed methodological approach to generating, analyzing, and  contextualizing sensor data for clinician-based machine learning. This framework  can guide nurse scientists in knowledge construction as they participate in  multidisciplinary health-assistive Smart Home and artificial intelligence  research. In this paper, we review philosophical underpinnings and explicate how  this framework can guide nurse scientists collaborating with engineers to develop  intelligent health-assistive Smart Homes. It is critical that clinical nursing  knowledge is integrated into Smart Home and artificial intelligence features. A  conceptual framework and practical method will provide needed structure for  knowledge construction by nurse scientists.

T2  - Artificial intelligence in medicine
AB  - As the world's population grows older, an increasing number of people are facing health issues. For the elderly, living alone can be difficult and dangerous.  Consequently, smart homes are becoming increasingly popular. A sensor-rich  environment can be exploited for healthcare applications, in particular, anomaly  detection (AD). The literature review for this paper showed that few works  consider environmental factors to detect anomalies. Instead, the focus is on user  activity and checking whether it is abnormal, i.e., does not conform to expected  behavior. Furthermore, reducing the number of anomalies using early detection is  a major issue in many applications. In this context, anomaly-cause discovery may  be helpful in recommending actions that may prevent risk. In this paper, we  present a novel approach for detecting the risk of anomalies occurring in the  environment regarding user activities. The method relies on anomaly-cause  extraction from a given dataset using causal association rules mining. These  anomaly causes are utilized afterward for real-time analysis to detect the risk  of anomalies using the Markov logic network machine learning method. The detected  risk allows the method to recommend suitable actions to perform in order to avoid  the occurrence of an actual anomaly. The proposed approach is implemented,  tested, and evaluated for each contribution using real data obtained from an  intelligent environment platform and real data from a clinical datasets.  Experimental results prove our approach to be efficient in terms of recognition  rate.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the performance of several commonly used machine learning methods to traditional statistical methods for  predicting emergency department and hospital utilization among patients receiving  publicly-funded home care services. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We conducted a  population-based retrospective cohort study of publicly-funded home care  recipients in the Hamilton-Niagara-Haldimand-Brant region of southern Ontario,  Canada between 2014 and 2016. Gradient boosted trees, neural networks, and random  forests were tested against two variations of logistic regression for predicting  three outcomes related to emergency department and hospital utilization within  six months of a comprehensive home care clinical assessment. Models were trained  on data from years 2014 and 2015 and tested on data from 2016. Performance was  compared using logarithmic score, Brier score, AUC, and diagnostic accuracy  measures. RESULTS: Gradient boosted trees achieved the best performance on all  three outcomes. Gradient boosted trees provided small but statistically  significant performance gains over both traditional methods on all three  outcomes, while neural networks significantly outperformed logistic regression on  two of three outcomes. However, sensitivity and specificity gains from using  gradient boosted trees over logistic regression were only in the range of 1%-2%  at several classification thresholds. CONCLUSION: Gradient boosted trees and  simple neural networks yielded small performance benefits over logistic  regression for predicting emergency department and hospital utilization among  patients receiving publicly-funded home care. However, the performance benefits  were of negligible clinical importance.

AB  - The aging of the world population is accompanied by a substantial increase in neurodegenerative disorders, such as dementia. Early detection of mild cognitive  impairment (MCI), a clinical diagnostic that comes with an increased chance to  develop dementias, could be an essential condition for promoting quality of life  and independent living, as it would provide a critical window for the  implementation of early pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions.  This systematic review aims to investigate the current state of knowledge on the  effectiveness of smart home sensors technologies for the early detection of MCI  through the monitoring of everyday life activities. This approach offers many  advantages, including the continuous measurement of functional abilities in  ecological environments. A systematic search of publications in MEDLINE, EMBASE,  and CINAHL, before November 2017, was conducted. Seventeen studies were included  in this review. Thirteen studies were based on real-life monitoring, with several  sensors installed in participants' actual homes, and four studies included  scenario-based assessments, in which participants had to complete various tasks  in a research lab apartment. In real-life monitoring, the most used indicators of  MCI were walking speed and activity/motion in the house. In scenario-based  assessment, time of completion, quality of activity completion, number of errors,  amount of assistance needed, and task-irrelevant behaviors during the performance  of everyday activities predicted MCI in participants. Despite technological  limitations and the novelty of the field, smart home technologies represent a  promising potential for the early screening of MCI and could support clinicians  in geriatric care.

AB  - Complexity, costs, and waiting list issues demand a simplified alternative for sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (SAHS) diagnosis. The blood oxygen saturation  signal (SpO(2)) carries useful information about SAHS and can be easily acquired  from overnight oximetry. In this study, SpO(2) single-channel recordings from 320  subjects were obtained at patients' homes and were used to automatically obtain  statistical, spectral, nonlinear, and clinical SAHS-related information.  Relevant, nonredundant data from these analyses were subsequently used to train  and validate four machine-learning methods with the ability to classify SpO(2)  signals into one of the four SAHS-severity degrees (no-SAHS, mild, moderate, and  severe). All the models trained (linear discriminant analysis, 1-vs-all logistic  regression, Bayesian multilayer perceptron, and AdaBoost) outperformed the  diagnostic ability of the conventionally used 3% oxygen desaturation index. An  AdaBoost model built with linear discriminants as base classifiers reached the  highest figures. It achieved 0.479 Cohen's κ in the SAHS severity classification,  as well as 92.9%, 87.4%, and 78.7% accuracies in binary classification tasks  using increasing severity thresholds (apnea-hypopnea index: 5, 15, and 30  events/hour, respectively). These results suggest that machine-learning can be  used along with SpO(2) information acquired at a patients' home to help in SAHS  diagnosis simplification.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This paper describes the results of a randomized clinical trial about the effectiveness of a computerized rehabilitation treatment on a sample of 31  patients affected by Parkinson disease. METHODS: Computerized exercises were  administered by the therapists to the intervention group (n = 17) through the  CoRe tool, which automatically generates a big variety of exercises leveraging on  a stimuli set (words, sounds and images) organized into a dedicated ontology. A  battery of standard neuropsychological tests was performed for patients'  assessment at baseline, after the treatment (that lasted 1 month), and after 6  months from the treatment stop. The control group underwent a sham intervention.  RESULTS: Results show a statistically significant clinical benefit from  computerized rehabilitation with respect to sham treatment. For the intervention  group, response time and response accuracy were integrated into a weighted score  that accounts also for the specific cognitive burden of each exercise.  Differently from the control group, the majority of patients in the intervention  group showed an improvement in that score, more marked in the first week of  treatment, and which lasts for the entire treatment period, which could account  both for a quick learning effect and for an improvement of cognitive conditions.  Good usability of CoRe, already observed in previous studies, was confirmed by  the present trial, where the percentage of protocol completion in the  intervention group is very high (all but one patient are above 90%). CONCLUSIONS:  The CoRe system showed to be effective to improve some cognitive abilities in  patients with Parkinson disease. However, after the end of the training, the  benefit is hardly maintained over time. These findings support the implementation  of CoRe in the clinical routine and the continuation of the treatment after  discharge through the use of a homecare version of the system.

Thus, a personalized knowledge transfer for caregiving relatives is  necessary. Against this background, methods to determine the personal relevance  and importance of knowledge resources for caregiving relatives are developed. To  evaluate these methods, an exemplary fictitious person is created by experts in  Nursing Science. In this evaluation, the approach's results are compared with an  expert opinion. The approach indicates that a personalized knowledge transfer is  possible, providing caregiving relatives with necessary care knowledge according  to their personal life situation.

AB  - Nowadays, due to the growing need for remote care and the constantly increasing popularity of mobile devices, a large amount of mobile applications for remote  care support has been developed. Although mobile phones are very suitable for  young people, there are still many problems related to remote health care of the  elderly. Due to hearing loss or limited movements, it is difficult for the  elderly to contact their families or doctors via real-time video call. In this  paper, we introduce a new remote health-care system based on moving robots  intended for the elderly at home. Since the proposed system is an online system,  the elderly can contact their families and doctors quickly anytime and anywhere.  Besides call, our system involves the accurate indoor object detection algorithms  and automatic health data collection, which are not included in existing remote  care systems. Therefore, the proposed system solves some challenging problems  related to the elderly care. The experiment has shown that the proposed care  system achieves excellent performance and provides good user experience.

AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: This article examines the attitudes of Finnish home care registered nurses, licensed vocational nurses and other health and social care  personnel towards the introduction and use of care robots in home care.  BACKGROUND: The significance of care robotics has been highlighted in recent  years. However, personnel-related social psychological barriers to the  introduction of care robots have been given very little study. DESIGN:  Cross-sectional study conducted by questionnaire. The theoretical framework of  the study is based on Ajzen's theory of planned behaviour and the research  discussion about attitudes towards robots. METHODS: The research data were  collected in five municipalities in different parts of Finland in 2016, and the  questionnaire was answered by a total of 200 home care workers. The research data  were analysed using exploratory factor analysis, Pearson product-moment  correlation, one-way analysis of variance and linear regression analysis.  RESULTS: The results are consistent with Ajzen's theory and previous studies on  the acceptance of information systems in health care. Personnel behavioural  intentions related to the introduction of robot applications in home care are  influenced by their personal appreciation of the usefulness of robots, the  expectations of their colleagues and supervisors, as well as by their own  perceptions of their capacity to learn to use care robots. In particular,  personnel emphasised the value of care robots in providing reminders and  guidance, as well as promoting the safety of the older people. CONCLUSIONS: The  study shows that an intimate human-robot relationship can pose a challenge from  the perspective of the acceptance of care robots. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE:  From the perspective of the introduction of care robots in home care, personnel  training and the construction of a positive working atmosphere play a key role.  In addition, the introduction of robots requires further consideration of a  number of ethical issues.

AB  - This study explored the use of unsupervised machine learning to identify subgroups of patients with heart failure who used telehealth services in the home  health setting, and examined intercluster differences for patient characteristics  related to medical history, symptoms, medications, psychosocial assessments, and  healthcare utilization. Using a feature selection algorithm, we selected seven  variables from 557 patients for clustering. We tested three clustering  techniques: hierarchical, k-means, and partitioning around medoids. Hierarchical  clustering was identified as the best technique using internal validation  methods. Intercluster differences among patient characteristics and outcomes were  assessed with either χ test or one-way analysis of variance. Ranging in size from  153 to 233 patients, three clusters displayed patterns that differed  significantly (P < .05) in patient characteristics of age, sex, medical history  of comorbid conditions, use of beta blockers, and quality of life assessment.  Significant (P < .001) intercluster differences in number of medications,  comorbidities, and healthcare utilization were also revealed. The study  identified patterns of association between (1) mental health status, pulmonary  disorders, and obesity, and (2) healthcare utilization for patients with heart  failure who used telehealth in the home health setting. Study results also  revealed a lack of prescription guideline-recommended heart failure medications  for the subgroup with the highest proportion of older female adults.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Socially assistive robots are being developed for patients to help manage chronic health conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  (COPD). Adherence to medication and availability of rehabilitation are suboptimal  in this patient group, which increases the risk of hospitalization. OBJECTIVE:  This pilot study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a robot delivering  telehealth care to increase adherence to medication and home rehabilitation,  improve quality of life, and reduce hospital readmission compared with a standard  care control group. METHODS: At discharge from hospital for a COPD admission, 60  patients were randomized to receive a robot at home for 4 months or to a control  group. Number of hospitalization days for respiratory admissions over the 4-month  study period was the primary outcome. Medication adherence, frequency of  rehabilitation exercise, and quality of life were also assessed. Implementation  interviews as well as benefit-cost analysis were conducted. RESULTS:  Intention-to-treat and per protocol analyses showed no significant differences in  the number of respiratory-related hospitalizations between groups. The  intervention group was more adherent to their long-acting inhalers (mean number  of prescribed puffs taken per day=48.5%) than the control group (mean 29.5%,  P=.03, d=0.68) assessed via electronic recording. Self-reported adherence was  also higher in the intervention group after controlling for covariates (P=.04).  The intervention group increased their rehabilitation exercise frequency compared  with the control group (mean difference -4.53, 95% CI -7.16 to -1.92). There were  no significant differences in quality of life. Of the 25 patients who had the  robot, 19 had favorable attitudes. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study suggests that a  homecare robot can improve adherence to medication and increase exercise. Further  research is needed with a larger sample size to further investigate effects on  hospitalizations after improvements are made to the robots. The robots could be  especially useful for patients struggling with adherence.

AB  - Parental decision making about childhood vaccinations is complex and multidimensional. There is a perception that the number of parents having  concerns regarding childhood vaccinations has been increasing in Canada. The aim  of this study was to explore vaccine hesitancy among Canadian parents and to  examine factors associated with a parent's intention to vaccinate his/her child.  Informed by the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) this study assesses potential  associations between parents' knowledge, attitudes and beliefs toward vaccination  and their intention to vaccinate their child in the future. A national sample of  Canadian parents of children aged 24-59 months (N = 2013) was surveyed using an  online survey methodology. Half of the surveyed parents strongly intended to have  their child vaccinated in the future. Parents' information needs and searches as  well as parents' trust in different institutions were associated with intention  to vaccinate. Parents who reported having frequently looked for vaccine  information, who considered that it was their role as parents to question  vaccines, or who had previously experienced difficulty accessing vaccination  services were less likely to strongly intend to vaccinate their child in the  future. Parents who had a high level of trust in doctors and public health were  most likely to strongly intend to vaccinate their child. Results of the  multivariate analysis showed that positive attitudes (aOR = 8.0; 95% CI: 6.0,  10.4), higher perceived social support (aOR = 3.0; 95% CI: 2.3, 3.93), and higher  perceived behavioural control (aOR = 1.8; 95% CI: 1.4, 2.43) were associated with  parents' intention to vaccinate their child. Findings of this study suggest that  trust-building interventions that promote pro-vaccine social norms and that  address negative attitudes toward vaccination could enhance vaccine acceptance  among Canadian parents.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It has been questioned by researchers in robotics as well in the general public to what extent companion-type robots can support the elderly with  the fulfillment of their psychological and social needs. Although these robots  have already been used in care settings in Germany, research has referred little  to this practical experience in order to analyze their impact and benefit. To  start to close this gap, the current article reports on the current use of  companion-type robots in care settings, on the effects reported by professional  caregivers as well as on the role of psychosocial needs in the acceptance and use  of companion-type robots by the elderly. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the first  study, 30 professional caregivers with experience in the use of the robot seal  Paro in care settings were interviewed regarding Paro's application and the  observed effects on their clients. In the second study, three case examples are  presented from an interaction study in which vulnerable elderly persons had the  robot dinosaur Pleo at their disposal for a maximum period of 15 days. RESULTS:  Paro is used very flexibly in a variety of settings and with a broad range of  user groups (study 1). The reported psychosocial effects were mainly positive but  short term. The case examples (study 2) show that psychosocial needs can both  foster or hinder robot acceptance and use. They also emphasize the important role  of caregivers in the interaction between the elderly and emotional robots in the  context of eldercare. CONCLUSION: The beneficial and ethical use of  companion-type robots in care settings demands a high commitment on the part of  the caregivers. Given this prerequisite, emotional robots can be a valuable  therapeutic tool.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The "OurPuppet" project comprises a sensor-based, interactive puppet that will be developed to communicate with people in need of care during a short  period of absence of the informal caregiver. Specially qualified puppet guides  will support the use of the new technical development. They instruct people with  dementia and caregivers on how to use the puppet and supervise the (informal)  care relationship through discussions on a regular basis. OBJECTIVES: The article  shows the specific components of users' needs for which the concrete technical  development should find answers. It also focuses on the opportunities and  challenges for the technical and social developmental process accompanied by  these demands. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The analysis of the users' needs is based on  a participatory approach. Semi-structured focus group interviews were conducted  with informal caregivers, nurses and volunteers in order to identify typical  situations in home care settings. The interviews were paraphrased and summarized  in order to deduce inductive categories (qualitative data analysis), which  describe everyday situations that the technical system should address. RESULTS  AND CONCLUSION: Such analyses provide information about the needs of potential  users and indicate how to design such technical systems. Furthermore,  opportunities and challenges of the development process as well as important  contextual information were identified.

AB  - In this study, the effective dose received by the family members and caregivers of 52 thyroid cancer patients, who had been treated with radioiodine I-131, was  measured to investigate the ability of the neural network to predict the doses to  the relatives. The effectiveness of this method to predict the relatives who will  receive doses of more than 1 mSv was evaluated. The effective doses were measured  by TLD. The inputs of the neural network include 13 different parameters that can  potentially affect the dose, and the output was the dose to the family members.  The neural networks in this study were feed-forward with a sigmoid activation  function and one hidden layer. The mean and median of the measured doses were  0.45 and 0.28 mSv and its range was 0.1-3.64 mSv. The mean square error of the  predicted doses by the neural network and the measured doses by TLD (mean squared  error) for 99 individuals was 0.142. The optimum neural network was able to  predict all the relatives who received doses of more than 1 mSv. The area under  the receiver operating characteristic curve for the trained neural network was  0.957, showing its ability to distinguish these groups. Predicting the dose to a  patient's relatives before release is a helpful strategy for future optimisation.  Using neural networks is a promising method for predicting the dose to the family  members and defining high-risk patients and relatives. Patient-specific criteria  for release and patient-specific advice and consultation can be used to reduce  the dose to each family member.

AB  - This multi-perspective study focuses on how a service robot for the elderly should behave when interacting with potential users. An existing service robot  and a scenario were used as a concrete case, which was discussed and analyzed  during focus group sessions with older adults (n = 38), informal caregivers  (n = 24), and professional caregivers (n = 35) in the Netherlands, France, and  the United Kingdom. A total of seven topics-privacy, task execution, environment,  appearance, behavior, visitors, and communication-were explored. The results  showed that some of the characteristics mentioned were unique to a user group,  but several were cross-cutting. Overall, potential users expected the service  robot to be customizable in order to match the users' needs and preferences.  Also, high expectations concerning its functioning and behavior were expressed,  which sometimes could even be compared to the qualities of a human being. This  emphasizes the complexity of service robot development for older adults, and  highlights the need for a personalized and flexible solution. One size does not  fit all, and specific attention should be paid to the development of the robot's  social behavior and skills beyond a mere functional support for the person.

T2  - Assistive technology : the official journal of RESNA
AB  - This research aims to improve patient transfers by developing a new type of advanced robotic assist device. It has multiple actuated degrees of freedom and a  powered steerable base to maximize maneuverability around obstacles. An intuitive  interface and control strategy allows the caregiver to simply push on the machine  in the direction of desired patient motion. The control integrates measurements  of both force and proximity to mitigate any potential large collision forces and  provides operators information about obstacles with a form of haptic feedback.  Electro-hydraulic pump controlled actuation provides high force density for the  actuation. Nineteen participants performed tests to compare transfer operations  (transferring a 250-lb mannequin between a wheelchair, chair, bed, and floor) and  interaction control of a prototype device with a commercially available patient  lift. The testing included a time study of the transfer operations and subjective  rating of device performance. The results show that operators perform transfer  tasks significantly faster and rate performance higher using the prototype  patient transfer assist device than with a current market patient lift. With  further development, features of the new patient lift can help facilitate patient  transfers that are safer, easier, and more efficient for caregivers.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This scoping study is the first step of a multiphase, international project aimed at designing a homecare robot that can provide functional support,  track physical and psychological well-being, and deliver therapeutic intervention  specifically for individuals with mild cognitive impairment. DESIGN:  Observational requirements gathering study. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTINGS:  Semistructured interviews were conducted with 3 participant groups: (1)  individuals with memory challenges, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or mild  dementia (patients; n = 9); (2) carers of those with MCI or dementia (carers;  n = 8); and (3) those with expertise in MCI or dementia research, clinical care,  or management (experts; n = 16). Interviews took place at the university, at  dementia care facilities or other workplaces, at participant's homes, or via  skype (experts only). MEASUREMENTS: Semistructured interviews were conducted,  transcribed, and reviewed. RESULTS: Several key themes were identified within the  4 topics of: (1) daily challenges, (2) safety and security, (3) monitoring health  and well-being, and (4) therapeutic intervention. CONCLUSIONS: A homecare robot  could provide both practical and therapeutic benefit for the mildly cognitively  impaired with 2 broad programs providing routine and reassurance; and tracking  health and well-being. The next phase of the project aims to program homecare  robots with scenarios developed from these results, integrate components from  project partners, and then test the feasibility, utility, and acceptability of  the homecare robot.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Socially assistive robots are increasingly used as a therapeutic tool for people with dementia, as a means to improve quality of life through social  connection. This paper presents a mixed-method integrative review of telepresence  robots used to improve social connection of people with dementia by enabling  real-time communication with their carers. METHODS: A systematic search of  Medline, ProQuest, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, EMBASE, and the  Cochrane library was conducted to gather available evidence on the use of  telepresence robots, specifically videoconferencing, to improve social  connectedness, in people with dementia. A narrative synthesis was used to analyze  the included studies. RESULTS: A review of 1,035 records, identified four  eligible peer-reviewed publications, reporting findings about three different  mobile telepresence robots. The study designs included qualitative and  mixed-methods approaches, focusing primarily on examining the feasibility and  acceptability of the telepresence robots within the context of dementia care.  These studies reported both positive outcomes of using telepresence robots to  connect people with dementia to others, as well as barriers, such as a lack of  experience in using a robot and technological issues. CONCLUSION: Although  limited, the current literature suggests that telepresence robots have potential  utility for improving social connectedness of people with dementia and their  carers. However, more systematic feasibility studies are needed to inform the  development of telepresence robots followed by clinical trials to establish  efficacy within dementia care.

AB  - A telepresence mobile robot is a remote-controlled, wheeled device with wireless internet connectivity for bidirectional audio, video and data transmission. In  health care, a telepresence robot could be used to have a clinician or a  caregiver assist seniors in their homes without having to travel to these  locations. Many mobile telepresence robotic platforms have recently been  introduced on the market, bringing mobility to telecommunication and vital sign  monitoring at reasonable costs. What is missing for making them effective remote  telepresence systems for home care assistance are capabilities specifically  needed to assist the remote operator in controlling the robot and perceiving the  environment through the robot's sensors or, in other words, minimizing cognitive  load and maximizing situation awareness. This paper describes our approach adding  navigation, artificial audition and vital sign monitoring capabilities to a  commercially available telepresence mobile robot. This requires the use of a  robot control architecture to integrate the autonomous and teleoperation  capabilities of the platform.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: This article describes an enhanced telepresence robot named ROBIN, part of a telecare system derived from the GIRAFFPLUS project for supporting and  monitoring older adults at home. ROBIN is integrated in a sensor-rich environment  that aims to continuously monitor physical and psychological wellbeing of older  persons living alone. The caregivers (formal/informal) can communicate through it  with their assisted persons. Long-term trials in real houses highlighted several  user requirements that inspired improvements on the robotic platform. The  enhanced telepresence robot was assessed by users to test its suitability to  support social interaction and provide motivational feedback on health-related  aspects. METHODS: Twenty-five users (n = 25) assessed the new multimodal  interaction capabilities and new communication services. A psychophysiological  approach was adopted to investigate aspects like engagement, usability, and  affective impact, as well as the possible role of individual differences on the  quality of human-robot interaction. RESULTS: ROBIN was overall judged usable, the  interaction with/through it resulted pleasant and the required workload was  limited, thus supporting the idea of using it as a central component for remote  assistance and social participation. Open-minded users tended to have a more  positive interaction with it. CONCLUSIONS: This work describes an enabling  technology for remote assistance and social communication. It highlights the  importance of being compliant with users' needs to develop solutions easy to use  and able to foster their social connections. The role of personality appeared to  be relevant for the interaction, underscoring a clear role of the service  personalization.

AB  - PURPOSE: The potential of service robots for seniors is given increasing attention as the ageing population in Western countries will continue to grow as  well as the demand for home care. In order to capture the experience of living  with a robot at home, a multi-perspective evaluation was conducted. METHODS:  Older adults (n = 10) were invited to execute an actual interaction scenario with  the Care-O-bot(®) robot in a home-like environment and were questioned about  their experiences. Additionally, interviews were conducted with the elderly  participants, informal carers (n = 7) and professional caregivers (n = 11).  RESULTS: Seniors showed to be more keen to accept the robot than their caregivers  and relatives. However, the robot in its current form was found to be too limited  and participants wished the robot could perform more complex tasks. In order to  be acceptable a future robot should execute these complex tasks based on the  personal preferences of the user which would require the robot to be flexible and  extremely smart, comparable to the care that is delivered by a human carer.  CONCLUSIONS: Developing the functional features to perform activities is not the  only challenge in robot development that deserves the attention of robot  developers. The development of social behaviour and skills should be addressed as  well. This is possible adopting a person-centred design approach, which relies on  validation activities with actual users in realistic environments, similar to  those described in this paper. Implications for rehabilitation Attitude of older  adults towards service robots Potential of service robotsfor older adults.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Smartphones contain sensors that measure movement-related data, making them promising tools for monitoring physical activity after a stroke.  Activity recognition (AR) systems are typically trained on movement data from  healthy individuals collected in a laboratory setting. However, movement patterns  change after a stroke (eg, gait impairment), and activities may be performed  differently at home than in a lab. Thus, it is important to validate AR for  gait-impaired stroke patients in a home setting for accurate clinical  predictions. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we sought to evaluate AR performance in a  home setting for individuals who had suffered a stroke, by using different sets  of training activities. Specifically, we compared AR performance for persons with  stroke while varying the origin of training data, based on either population  (healthy persons or persons with stoke) or environment (laboratory or home  setting). METHODS: Thirty individuals with stroke and fifteen healthy subjects  performed a series of mobility-related activities, either in a laboratory or at  home, while wearing a smartphone. A custom-built app collected signals from the  phone's accelerometer, gyroscope, and barometer sensors, and subjects  self-labeled the mobility activities. We trained a random forest AR model using  either healthy or stroke activity data. Primary measures of AR performance were  (1) the mean recall of activities and (2) the misclassification of stationary and  ambulatory activities. RESULTS: A classifier trained on stroke activity data  performed better than one trained on healthy activity data, improving average  recall from 53% to 75%. The healthy-trained classifier performance declined with  gait impairment severity, more often misclassifying ambulatory activities as  stationary ones. The classifier trained on in-lab activities had a lower average  recall for at-home activities (56%) than for in-lab activities collected on a  different day (77%). CONCLUSIONS: Stroke-based training data is needed for high  quality AR among gait-impaired individuals with stroke. Additionally, AR systems  for home and community monitoring would likely benefit from including at-home  activities in the training data.

T2  - Disability and rehabilitation. Assistive technology
AB  - PURPOSE: The home-based rehabilitation of elderly patients improves their autonomy, independence and reintegration into society. Hence, a suitable  environment plays an important role in rehabilitation, as do different assistance  technologies. The majority of accidents at home involving elderly people occur in  the bathroom. Therefore, the planning of the layout of facilities is important in  this potentially dangerous area. This paper proposes an approach towards  designing and optimizing the layout of facilities in the bathroom, based on  logistical and nonlogistical relationships. METHODOLOGY: A fuzzy-based analytical  hierarchical process (fuzzy-AHP) is then proposed for a comprehensive evaluation  of the alternatives for this layout plan. This approach was applied to the home  of a 71 years old female patient, who was experiencing home-based rehabilitation.  After the initial designing and optimizing of the layout of the facilities in her  bathroom, a plan could then be created for her particular needs. FINDINGS: The  results of this research could then enable the home-based rehabilitation of  elderly patients to be more effective. Value: This paper develops a new approach  to design and optimize the layout of facilities in bathroom for the elderly.  Implications for Rehabilitation Develop a new approach to design and optimize the  layout of facilities in bathroom. Provide a mathematical and more scientific  approach to home layout design for home-based rehabilitation. Provide new  opportunities for research, for both the therapist and the patient to analyse the  home facility layout.

AB  - In attempting to provide protection to individuals and communities, childhood immunization has benefits that far outweigh disease risks. However, some parents  decide not to immunize their children with some or all vaccines for reasons  including lack of trust in governments, health professionals, and vaccine  manufacturers. This article employs a theoretical analysis of trust and distrust  to explore how twenty-seven parents with a history of vaccine rejection in two  Australian cities view the expert systems central to vaccination policy and  practice. Our data show how perceptions of the profit motive generate distrust in  the expert systems pertaining to vaccination. Our participants perceived that  pharmaceutical companies had a pernicious influence over the systems driving  vaccination: research, health professionals, and government. Accordingly, they  saw vaccine recommendations in conflict with the interests of their child and  "the system" underscored by malign intent, even if individual representatives of  this system were not equally tainted. This perspective was common to parents who  declined all vaccines and those who accepted some. We regard the differences  between these parents-and indeed the differences between vaccine decliners and  those whose Western medical epistemology informs reflexive trust-as arising from  the internalization of countering views, which facilitates nuance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Assistive technology, in the form of a smart home environment, is employed to support people with dementia. OBJECTIVES: To propose a system for  continuous and objective remote monitoring of problematic daily living activity  areas and design personalized interventions based on system feedback and clinical  observations for improving cognitive function and health-related quality of life.  METHODS: The assistive technology of the proposed system, including wearable,  sleep, object motion, presence, and utility usage sensors, was methodically  deployed at four different home installations of people with cognitive  impairment. Detection of sleep patterns, physical activity, and activities of  daily living, based on the collected sensor data and analytics, was available at  all times through comprehensive data visualization solutions. Combined with  clinical observation, targeted psychosocial interventions were introduced to  enhance the participants' quality of life and improve their cognitive functions  and daily functionality. Meanwhile, participants and their caregivers were able  to visualize a reduced set of information tailored to their needs. RESULTS:  Overall, paired-sample t-test analysis of monitored qualities revealed  improvement for all participants in neuropsychological assessment. Moreover,  improvement was detected from the beginning to the end of the trial, in physical  condition and in the domains of sleep. Detecting abnormalities via the system,  for example in sleep quality, such as REM sleep, has proved to be critical to  assess current status, drive interventions, and evaluate improvements in a  reliable manner. CONCLUSION: It has been proved that the proposed system is  suitable to support clinicians to reliably drive and evaluate clinical  interventions toward quality of life improvement of people with cognitive  impairment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Robots have the potential to both enable older adults with dementia to perform daily activities with greater independence, and provide support to  caregivers. This study explored perspectives of older adults with Alzheimer's  disease (AD) and their caregivers on robots that provide stepwise prompting to  complete activities in the home. METHODS: Ten dyads participated: Older adults  with mild-to-moderate AD and difficulty completing activity steps, and their  family caregivers. Older adults were prompted by a tele-operated robot to wash  their hands in the bathroom and make a cup of tea in the kitchen. Caregivers  observed interactions. Semi-structured interviews were conducted individually.  Transcribed interviews were thematically analyzed. RESULTS: Three themes  summarized responses to robot interactions: contemplating a future with assistive  robots, considering opportunities with assistive robots, and reflecting on  implications for social relationships. Older adults expressed opportunities for  robots to help in daily activities, were open to the idea of robotic assistance,  but did not want a robot. Caregivers identified numerous opportunities and were  more open to robots. Several wanted a robot, if available. Positive consequences  of robots in caregiving scenarios could include decreased frustration, stress,  and relationship strain, and increased social interaction via the robot. A  negative consequence could be decreased interaction with caregivers. CONCLUSIONS:  Few studies have investigated in-depth perspectives of older adults with dementia  and their caregivers following direct interaction with an assistive prompting  robot. To fulfill the potential of robots, continued dialogue between users and  developers, and consideration of robot design and caregiving relationship factors  are necessary.

T2  - Journal of medical systems
AB  - Caring for people with dementia imposes significant stress on family members and caregivers. Often, these informal caregivers have no coping strategy to deal with  these behaviors. Anxiety and stress episodes are often triggered by problematic  behaviors exhibited by the person who suffers from dementia. Detecting these  behaviors could help them in dealing with them and reduce caregiver burden.  However, work on anxiety detection using physiological signals has mostly been  done under controlled conditions. In this paper we describe an experiment aimed  at inducing anxiety among caregivers of people with dementia under naturalistic  conditions. We report an experiment, using the naturalistic enactment technique,  in which 10 subjects were asked to care for an older adult who acts as if she  experiences dementia. We record physiological signals from the participants (GSR,  HR, EEG) during the sessions that lasted for approximately 30 min. We explain how  we obtained ground truth from self-report and observation data. We conducted two  different tests using the Support Vector Machine technique. We obtained an  average precision of 77.8 % and 38.1 % recall when classifying two different  possible states: "Anxious" and "Not anxious". Analysis of the data provides  evidence that the experiment elicits state anxiety and that it can be detected  using wearable sensors. Furthermore, if episodes of problematic behaviors can  also be detected, the recognition of anxiety in the caregiver can be improved,  leading to the enactment of appropriate interventions to help caregivers cope  with anxiety episodes.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Discharging patients from the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) can be delayed for non-medical reasons including the procurement of home medical  equipment, parental education, and the need for children's services. We  previously created a model to identify patients that will be medically ready for  discharge in the subsequent 2-10 days. In this study we use Natural Language  Processing to improve upon that model and discern why the model performed poorly  on certain patients. METHODS: We retrospectively examined the text of the  Assessment and Plan section from daily progress notes of 4,693 patients (103,206  patient-days) from the NICU of a large, academic children's hospital. A matrix  was constructed using words from NICU notes (single words and bigrams) to train a  supervised machine learning algorithm to determine the most important words  differentiating poorly performing patients compared to well performing patients  in our original discharge prediction model. RESULTS: NLP using a bag of words  (BOW) analysis revealed several cohorts that performed poorly in our original  model. These included patients with surgical diagnoses, pulmonary hypertension,  retinopathy of prematurity, and psychosocial issues. DISCUSSION: The BOW approach  aided in cohort discovery and will allow further refinement of our original  discharge model prediction. Adequately identifying patients discharged home on  g-tube feeds alone could improve the AUC of our original model by 0.02.  Additionally, this approach identified social issues as a major cause for delayed  discharge. CONCLUSION: A BOW analysis provides a method to improve and refine our  NICU discharge prediction model and could potentially avoid over 900 (0.9%)  hospital days.

AB  - In this paper a prototype system is presented for home-based physical tele-therapy using a wearable device for haptic feedback. The haptic feedback is  generated as a sequence of vibratory cues from 8 vibrator motors equally spaced  along an elastic wearable band. The motors guide the patients' movement as they  perform a prescribed exercise routine in a way that replaces the physical  therapists' haptic guidance in an unsupervised or remotely supervised home-based  therapy session. A pilot study of 25 human subjects was performed that focused  on: a) testing the capability of the system to guide the users in arbitrary  motion paths in the space and b) comparing the motion of the users during typical  physical therapy exercises with and without haptic-based guidance. The results  demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed system.

The first one is a hybrid system for improving  the user experience in the hyperbaric oxygen chamber by 3D stereoscopic virtual  reality glasses and immersive perception. Several HMDs have been tested and  compared. The second application is a voice interactive serious game as a likely  solution for providing assistive rehabilitation tool for therapists. The recorder  of the voice of patients could be analysed to evaluate the long-time  rehabilitation results and further to predict the rehabilitation process.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the outcomes of home-based robot-guided therapy and compare it to laboratory-based robot-guided therapy for the treatment of impaired ankles  in children with cerebral palsy. DESIGN: A randomized comparative trial design  comparing a home-based training group and a laboratory-based training group.  SETTING: Home versus laboratory within a research hospital. PARTICIPANTS:  Children (N=41) with cerebral palsy who were at Gross Motor Function  Classification System level I, II, or III were randomly assigned to 2 groups.  Children in home-based and laboratory-based groups were 8.7±2.8 (n=23) and  10.7±6.0 (n=18) years old, respectively. INTERVENTIONS: Six-week combined passive  stretching and active movement intervention of impaired ankle in a laboratory or  home environment using a portable rehabilitation robot. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:  Active dorsiflexion range of motion (as the primary outcome), mobility (6-minute  walk test and timed Up and Go test), balance (Pediatric Balance Scale), Selective  Motor Control Assessment of the Lower Extremity, Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS)  for spasticity, passive range of motion (PROM), strength, and joint stiffness.  RESULTS: Significant improvements were found for the home-based group in all  biomechanical outcome measures except for PROM and all clinical outcome measures  except the MAS. The laboratory-based group also showed significant improvements  in all the biomechanical outcome measures and all clinical outcome measures  except the MAS. There were no significant differences in the outcome measures  between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the translation of  repetitive, goal-directed, biofeedback training through motivating games from the  laboratory to the home environment is feasible. The benefits of home-based  robot-guided therapy were similar to those of laboratory-based robot-guided  therapy.

AB  - To support care giving in an aging society with a shrinking population, various life support robots are being developed. In the authors' laboratory, an excretion  care support robot (ECSR) with human cooperative characteristic has been  developed to relieve the burden of caregivers and improve the quality of life for  bedridden persons. This robot consists of a portable toilet with storage tank and  a mobile robot which can run autonomously to conduct the cooperative work with  others. Our research is focused on how to improve the motion accuracy and how the  robot can cooperate with users. In this paper, to enable the ECSR could precisely  move in the indoor environment, a proper controller is proposed considering the  center of gravity shift and load changes. Then, to perform the cooperative task,  two acceleration sensors are used to recognize the users' intended posture and  position when moving from bed to toilet. The robot's target angle and position  are determined by the user's posture. The effectiveness of the proposed method is  verified by a pseudo excretion support experiment.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to design effectively integrated information architecture for a mobile teleoperated robot in remote assistance to  the delivery of home health care. METHODS: Three role classes were identified  related to the deployment of a telerobot, namely, engineer, technology  integrator, and health professional. Patients and natural caregivers were  indirectly considered, this being a component of future field studies.  Interviewing representatives of each class provided the functions, and  information content and flows for each function. Interview transcripts enabled  the formulation of UML (Universal Modeling Language) diagrams for feedback from  participants. The proposed information architecture was validated with a use-case  scenario. RESULTS: The integrated information architecture incorporates  progressive design, ergonomic integration, and the home care needs from medical  specialist, nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and social worker care  perspectives. The integrated architecture iterative process promoted insight  among participants. The use-case scenario evaluation showed the design's  robustness. CONCLUSIONS: Complex innovation such as a telerobot must coherently  mesh with health-care service delivery needs. The deployment of integrated  information architecture bridging development, with specialist and home care  applications, is necessary for home care technology innovation. It enables  continuing evolution of robot and novel health information design in the same  integrated architecture, while accounting for patient ecological need.

TI  - Ethical Considerations Regarding the Use of Smart Home Technologies for Older Adults: An Integrative Review.
AU  - Chung, Jane

T2  - Annual review of nursing research
AB  - PROBLEM: With the wide adoption and use of smart home applications, there is a need for examining ethical issues regarding smart home use at the intersection of  aging, technology, and home environment. PURPOSE: The purpose of this review is  to provide an overview of ethical considerations and the evidence on these  ethical issues based on an integrative literature review with regard to the  utilization of smart home technologies by older adults and their family members.  REVIEW DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted an integrative literature review of the  scientific literature from indexed databases (e. g., MEDLINE, CINAHL, and  PsycINFO). The framework guiding this review is derived from previous work on  ethical considerations related to telehealth use for older adults and smart homes  for palliative care. Key ethical issues of the framework include privacy,  informed consent, autonomy, obtrusiveness, equal access, reduction in human  touch, and usability. RESULTS: Six hundred and thirty-five candidate articles  were identified between the years 1990 and 2014. Sixteen articles were included  in the review. Privacy and obtrusiveness issues appear to be the most important  factors that can affect smart home technology adoption. In addition, this article  recommends that stigmatization and reliability and maintenance of the system are  additional factors to consider. IMPLICATIONS: When smart home technology is used  appropriately, it has the potential to improve quality of life and maintain  safety among older adults, ultimately supporting the desire of older adults for  aging in place. The ability to respond to potential ethical concerns will be  critical to the future development and application of smart home technologies  that aim to enhance safety and independence.

AB  - Assistive Technologies (AT) are an application area where several Artificial Intelligence techniques and tools have been successfully applied to support  elderly or impeded people on their daily activities. However, approaches to AT  tend to center in the user-tool interaction, neglecting the user's connection  with its social environment (such as caretakers, relatives and health  professionals) and the possibility to monitor undesired behaviour providing both  adaptation to a dynamic environment and early response to potentially dangerous  situations. In previous work we have presented COAALAS, an intelligent social and  norm-aware device for elderly people that is able to autonomously organize,  reorganize and interact with the different actors involved in elderly-care,  either human actors or other devices. In this paper we put our work into context,  by first examining what are the desirable properties of such a system, analysing  the state-of-the-art on the relevant topics, and verifying the validity of our  proposal in a larger context that we call AVICENA. AVICENA's aim is develop a  semi-autonomous (collaborative) tool to promote monitored, intensive, extended  and personalized therapeutic regime adherence at home based on adaptation  techniques.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Resources for home care rehabilitation are limited, and many home care clients who could benefit do not receive rehabilitation therapy. The  interRAI Contact Assessment (CA) is a new screening instrument comprised of a  subset of interRAI Home Care (HC) items, designed to be used as a preliminary  assessment to identify which potential home care clients should be referred for a  full assessment, or for services such as rehabilitation. We investigated which  client characteristics are most relevant in predicting rehabilitation use in the  full interRAI HC assessment. METHODS: We applied two algorithms from machine  learning and data mining - the LASSO and the random forest - to frequency matched  interRAI HC and service utilization data for home care clients in Ontario,  Canada. RESULTS: Analyses confirmed the importance of functional decline and  mobility variables in targeting rehabilitation services, but suggested that other  items in use as potential predictors may be less relevant. Six of the most highly  ranked items related to ambulation. Diagnosis of cancer was highly associated  with decreased rehabilitation use; however, cognitive status was not.  CONCLUSIONS: Inconsistencies between variables considered important for  classifying clients who need rehabilitation and those identified in this study  based on use may indicate a discrepancy in the client characteristics considered  relevant in theory versus actual practice.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Assistive and robotic training devices are increasingly used for rehabilitation of the hemiparetic arm after stroke, although applications for the  wrist and hand are trailing behind. Furthermore, applying a training device in  domestic settings may enable an increased training dose of functional arm and  hand training. The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility and  potential clinical changes associated with a technology-supported arm and hand  training system at home for patients with chronic stroke. METHODS: A dynamic  wrist and hand orthosis was combined with a remotely monitored user interface  with motivational gaming environment for self-administered training at home.  Twenty-four chronic stroke patients with impaired arm/hand function were  recruited to use the training system at home for six weeks. Evaluation of  feasibility involved training duration, usability and motivation. Clinical  outcomes on arm/hand function, activity and participation were assessed before  and after six weeks of training and at two-month follow-up. RESULTS: Mean System  Usability Scale score was 69 % (SD 17 %), mean Intrinsic Motivation Inventory  score was 5.2 (SD 0.9) points, and mean training duration per week was 105 (SD  66) minutes. Median Fugl-Meyer score improved from 37 (IQR 30) pre-training to 41  (IQR 32) post-training and was sustained at two-month follow-up (40 (IQR 32)).  The Stroke Impact Scale improved from 56.3 (SD 13.2) pre-training to 60.0 (SD  13.9) post-training, with a trend at follow-up (59.8 (SD 15.2)). No significant  improvements were found on the Action Research Arm Test and Motor Activity Log.  CONCLUSIONS: Remotely monitored post-stroke training at home applying gaming  exercises while physically supporting the wrist and hand showed to be feasible:  participants were able and motivated to use the training system independently at  home. Usability shows potential, although several usability issues need further  attention. Upper extremity function and quality of life improved after training,  although dexterity did not. These findings indicate that home-based arm and hand  training with physical support from a dynamic orthosis is a feasible tool to  enable self-administered practice at home. Such an approach enables practice  without dependence on therapist availability, allowing an increase in training  dose with respect to treatment in supervised settings. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This  study has been registered at the Netherlands Trial Registry (NTR): NTR3669 .

AB  - Finding appropriate evidence to support clinical practices is always challenging, and the construction of a query to retrieve such evidence is a fundamental step.  Typically, evidence is found using manual or semi-automatic methods, which are  time-consuming and sometimes make it difficult to construct knowledge-based  complex queries. To overcome the difficulty in constructing knowledge-based  complex queries, we utilized the knowledge base (KB) of the clinical decision  support system (CDSS), which has the potential to provide sufficient contextual  information. To automatically construct knowledge-based complex queries, we  designed methods to parse rule structure in KB of CDSS in order to determine an  executable path and extract the terms by parsing the control structures and logic  connectives used in the logic. The automatically constructed knowledge-based  complex queries were executed on the PubMed search service to evaluate the  results on the reduction of retrieved citations with high relevance. The average  number of citations was reduced from 56,249 citations to 330 citations with the  knowledge-based query construction approach, and relevance increased from 1 term  to 6 terms on average. The ability to automatically retrieve relevant evidence  maximizes efficiency for clinicians in terms of time, based on feedback collected  from clinicians. This approach is generally useful in evidence-based medicine,  especially in ambient assisted living environments where automation is highly  important.

TI  - Tele-care robot for assisting independent senior citizens who live at home.
AU  - Katz, Reuven
T2  - Studies in health technology and informatics
AB  - In the last twenty years most developed countries face dramatic demographic changes, and predominantly the rapid aging of their population. As the share of  elderly people is climbing while the number of care providers is declining, the  aging problem is becoming an increasingly important social and economic  challenge. The supply of care at home, utilizing affordable tele-care systems and  smart home technologies, is one of the promising strategies to cope with  challenges posed by these demographic changes. The goal of this paper is to  present a tele-care robot (TCR) aimed to assist Senior citizens who live  independently at their home, that need assistance in daily life activities. The  idea of the proposed system is that a caregiver, operating from a central  location, will be able to service between 10 to 20 patients living at their home,  by using the tele-care robot. The robot will possess motion control capabilities  to move inside the house of each patient and alert in case that emergency events  occur. The robot will allow the care provider to communicate remotely with the  patient using audio and video equipment installed on the robot. By using the  robot, the caregiver will be able to examine several times during the day the  well-being of the patient, his medication consumption, and his overall  functionality.

AB  - Smart home technologies offer potential benefits for assisting clinicians by automating health monitoring and well-being assessment. In this paper, we examine  the actual benefits of smart home-based analysis by monitoring daily behavior in  the home and predicting clinical scores of the residents. To accomplish this  goal, we propose a clinical assessment using activity behavior (CAAB) approach to  model a smart home resident's daily behavior and predict the corresponding  clinical scores. CAAB uses statistical features that describe characteristics of  a resident's daily activity performance to train machine learning algorithms that  predict the clinical scores. We evaluate the performance of CAAB utilizing smart  home sensor data collected from 18 smart homes over two years. We obtain a  statistically significant correlation ( r=0.72) between CAAB-predicted and  clinician-provided cognitive scores and a statistically significant correlation (  r=0.45) between CAAB-predicted and clinician-provided mobility scores. These  prediction results suggest that it is feasible to predict clinical scores using  smart home sensor data and learning-based data analysis.

TI  - A Context-Aware Interactive Health Care System Based on Ontology and Fuzzy Inference.
AU  - Chiang, Tzu-Chiang

T2  - Journal of medical systems
AB  - In the present society, most families are double-income families, and as the long-term care is seriously short of manpower, it contributes to the rapid  development of tele-homecare equipment, and the smart home care system gradually  emerges, which assists the elderly or patients with chronic diseases in daily  life. This study aims at interaction between persons under care and the system in  various living spaces, as based on motion-sensing interaction, and the  context-aware smart home care system is proposed. The system stores the required  contexts in knowledge ontology, including the physiological information and  environmental information of the person under care, as the database of decision.  The motion-sensing device enables the person under care to interact with the  system through gestures. By the inference mechanism of fuzzy theory, the system  can offer advice and rapidly execute service, thus, implementing the EHA. In  addition, the system is integrated with the functions of smart phone, tablet PC,  and PC, in order that users can implement remote operation and share information  regarding the person under care. The health care system constructed in this study  enables the decision making system to probe into the health risk of each person  under care; then, from the view of preventive medicine, and through a composing  system and simulation experimentation, tracks the physiological trend of the  person under care, and provides early warning service, thus, promoting smart home  care.

AB  - Home monitoring of chronically ill or elderly patient can reduce frequent hospitalisations and hence provide improved quality of care at a reduced cost to  the community, therefore reducing the burden on the healthcare system. Activity  recognition of such patients is of high importance in such a design. In this  work, a system for automatic human physical activity recognition from smart-phone  inertial sensors data is proposed. An ensemble of decision trees framework is  adopted to train and predict the multi-class human activity system. A comparison  of our proposed method with a multi-class traditional support vector machine  shows significant improvement in activity recognition accuracies.

AB  - PURPOSE: The present study reports on a robotic stroke therapy delivery and monitoring system intervention. The aims of this pilot implementation project  were to determine participants' general impressions about the benefits and  barriers of using robotic therapy devices for in-home rehabilitation. METHODS: We  used a qualitative study design employing ethnographic-based anthropological  methods including direct observation of the in-home environment and in-depth  semi-structured interviews with 10 users of the hand or foot robotic devices.  Thematic analysis was conducted using an inductive approach. RESULTS:  Participants reported positive experiences with the robotic stroke therapy  delivery and monitoring system. Benefits included convenience, self-reported  increased mobility, improved mood and an outlet for physical and mental tension  and anxiety. Barriers to use were few and included difficulties with placing the  device on the body, bulkiness of the monitor and modem connection problems.  CONCLUSIONS: Telerehabilitation robotic devices can be used as a tool to extend  effective, evidence-based and specialized rehabilitation services for upper and  lower limb rehabilitation to rural Veterans with poor access to care.  Implications for Rehabilitation Participants whose formal therapy services had  ended either because they had exhausted their benefits or because traveling to  outpatient therapy was too cumbersome due to distance were able to perform  therapeutic activities in the home daily (or at least multiple times per week).  Participants who were still receiving formal therapy services either in-home or  in the clinic were able to perform therapeutic activities in the home on the days  they were not attending/receiving formal therapy. Based on the feedback from  these veterans and their caregivers, the manufacturing company is working on  modifying the devices to be less cumbersome and more user-friendly  (lighter-weight, more mobile, changing software, etc.), as well as more adaptable  to participants' homes. Removing these specific barriers will potentially allow  participants to utilize the device more easily and more frequently. Since  participants expressed that they wished they could have the device in their homes  longer than the 3-month usage period required for this pilot project, the project  team is working on a proposal to extend this project to a wider area and the new  paradigm would extend the usage period until the patient reaches a plateau in  progress or no longer wants to use the device.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the effects of home-based robot-assisted rehabilitation coupled with a home exercise program compared with  a home exercise program alone on depression and quality of life in people after  stroke. METHOD: A multisite randomized controlled clinical trial was completed  with 99 people<6 mo after stroke who had limited access to formal therapy.  Participants were randomized into one of two groups, (1) a home exercise program  or (2) a robot-assisted therapy+home exercise program, and participated in an  8-wk home intervention. RESULTS: We observed statistically significant changes in  all but one domain on the Stroke Impact Scale and the Center for Epidemiologic  Studies Depression Scale for both groups. CONCLUSION: A robot-assisted  intervention coupled with a home exercise program and a home exercise program  alone administered using a telerehabilitation model may be valuable approaches to  improving quality of life and depression in people after stroke.

AB  - A globally ageing population is resulting in an increased prevalence of chronic conditions which affect older adults. Such conditions require long-term care and  management to maximize quality of life, placing an increasing strain on  healthcare resources. Intelligent environments such as smart homes facilitate  long-term monitoring of activities in the home through the use of sensor  technology. Access to sensor datasets is necessary for the development of novel  activity monitoring and recognition approaches. Access to such datasets is  limited due to issues such as sensor cost, availability and deployment time. The  use of simulated environments and sensors may address these issues and facilitate  the generation of comprehensive datasets. This paper provides a review of  existing approaches for the generation of simulated smart home activity datasets,  including model-based approaches and interactive approaches which implement  virtual sensors, environments and avatars. The paper also provides recommendation  for future work in intelligent environment simulation.

T2  - Journal of biomedical informatics
AB  - As healthcare shifts from the hospital to the home, it is becoming increasingly important to understand how patients interact with home medical devices, to  inform the safe and patient-friendly design of these devices. Distributed  Cognition (DCog) has been a useful theoretical framework for understanding  situated interactions in the healthcare domain. However, it has not previously  been applied to study interactions with home medical devices. In this study, DCog  was applied to understand renal patients' interactions with Home Hemodialysis  Technology (HHT), as an example of a home medical device. Data was gathered  through ethnographic observations and interviews with 19 renal patients and  interviews with seven professionals. Data was analyzed through the principles  summarized in the Distributed Cognition for Teamwork methodology. In this paper  we focus on the analysis of system activities, information flows, social  structures, physical layouts, and artefacts. By explicitly considering different  ways in which cognitive processes are distributed, the DCog approach helped to  understand patients' interaction strategies, and pointed to design opportunities  that could improve patients' experiences of using HHT. The findings highlight the  need to design HHT taking into consideration likely scenarios of use in the home  and of the broader home context. A setting such as home hemodialysis has the  characteristics of a complex and safety-critical socio-technical system, and a  DCog approach effectively helps to understand how safety is achieved or  compromised in such a system.

The method outlined in this paper for developing a Danish  national homecare nursing SNOMED CT subsets is a pragmatic approach to build new  SNOMED CT subsets drawing on existing and available SNOMED CT subsets. Combining  this approach with awareness of hierarchical coherency in SNOMED CT subsets makes  effective retrieval of data possible.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The compact Motorized orthosis for home rehabilitation of Gait (MoreGait) was developed for continuation of locomotion training at home.  MoreGait generates afferent stimuli of walking with the user in a semi-supine  position and provides feedback about deviations from the reference walking  pattern. OBJECTIVE: Prospective, pre-post intervention, proof-of-concept study to  test the feasibility of an unsupervised home-based application of five MoreGait  prototypes in subjects with incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI). METHODS:  Twenty-five (5 tetraplegia, 20 paraplegia) participants with chronic (mean time  since injury: 5.8 ± 5.4 (standard deviation, SD) years) sensorimotor iSCI (7 ASIA  Impairment Scale (AIS) C, 18 AIS D; Walking Index for Spinal Cord Injury (WISCI  II): Interquartile range 9 to 16) completed the training (45 minutes / day, at  least 4 days / week, 8 weeks). Baseline status was documented 4 and 2 weeks  before and at training onset. Training effects were assessed after 4 and 8 weeks  of therapy. RESULTS: After therapy, 9 of 25 study participants improved with  respect to the dependency on walking aids assessed by the WISCI II. For all  individuals, the short-distance walking velocity measured by the 10-Meter Walk  Test showed significant improvements compared to baseline (100%) for both  self-selected (Mean 139.4% ± 35.5% (SD)) and maximum (Mean 143.1% ± 40.6% (SD))  speed conditions as well as the endurance estimated with the six-minute walk test  (Mean 166.6% ± 72.1% (SD)). One device-related adverse event (pressure sore on  the big toe) occurred in over 800 training sessions. CONCLUSIONS: Home-based  robotic locomotion training with MoreGait is feasible and safe. The magnitude of  functional improvements achieved by MoreGait in individuals with iSCI is well  within the range of complex locomotion robots used in hospitals. Thus,  unsupervised MoreGait training potentially represents an option to prolong  effective training aiming at recovery of locomotor function beyond in-patient  rehabilitation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Socially assistive robotics (SAR) has been a major field of investigation during the last decade and, as it develops, the groups the  technology can be applied to and all ways in which these can be assisted are  rapidly increasing. OBJECTIVE: The main objective is to design and develop a  complete robotic agent, so that it performs physical and mental activities for  elderly people to maintain their healthy life habits and, as a final result,  improve their quality of life. METHODS: LEGO Mindstorms NXT® robot's unique  capacity for adaptability and engaging its users to develop coaching activities  and assistive rehabilitation for the elderly. Such activities will aim to enhance  healthy habits and provide training in physical and mental rehabilitation. The  robot is attached to an iPod Touch that acts as its interface. RESULTS: The robot  has been tested by a voluntary group of residents, also from that retirement  home. Results in the variables of the questionnaire show scores above 4 points  out of 5 for all the categories. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the tests, an easy to use  Robot is prepared to deliver basic coaching for physical activities as proposed  by the client, the staff of La Misericordia, who confirmed their satisfaction  regarding this aspect.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to quantify associations between hemoglobin A1C (A1C) and diabetes knowledge score using an assessment tool developed to evaluate  the level of diabetes knowledge in young adults with Type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and  their parent/primary caregiver. Seventy-five participants with T1DM, ages 15-22  years, completed questionnaires. Two 25-item questionnaires were developed: one  for patient and one for caregiver. Linear regression quantified associations  between correct items on the tools and participant A1C and demographic  characteristics. Mean age of participants was 16.7 ± 1.7 years, diabetes duration  5.9 ± 4.2 years, 46.7% male, 74.7% Caucasian, 69.3% on multiple daily injections,  and 30.7% on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion therapy; 78.7% of  parents/caregivers completed the questionnaire. A significant interaction was  observed between patient and caregiver scores with A1C by diabetes duration.  Among patients with diabetes <6 years, higher patient and caregiver scores were  associated with lower A1C (-0.25 ± 0.11, p = .03 and -0.59 ± 0.19, p = .005,  respectively) accounting for age, gender, race, therapy, and insurance. Neither  patient nor caregiver score was associated with A1C in patients with diabetes  duration ≥6 years. Better performance on a diabetes knowledge assessment (for  both patient and the caregiver) was found to be associated with more favorable  levels of glycemic control among young adults with diabetes <6 years. Additional  evaluation of these questionnaires and novel interventions to enhance knowledge  in this population are needed.

AB  - Commercially available devices for Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)-controlled robotic stroke rehabilitation are prohibitively expensive for many researchers  who are interested in the topic and physicians who would utilize such a device.  Additionally, they are cumbersome and require a technician to operate, increasing  the inaccessibility of such devices for home-based robotic stroke rehabilitation  therapy. Presented here is the design, implementation and test of an inexpensive,  portable and adaptable BCI-controlled hand therapy device. The system utilizes a  soft, flexible, pneumatic glove which can be used to deflect the subject's wrist  and fingers. Operation is provided by a custom-designed pneumatic circuit. Air  flow is controlled by an embedded system, which receives serial port instruction  from a PC running real-time BCI software. System tests demonstrate that glove  control can be successfully driven by a real-time BCI. A system such as the one  described here may be used to explore closed loop neurofeedback rehabilitation in  stroke relatively inexpensively and potentially in home environments.

AB  - While frailty and other multi-scale factors have to be correlated during a geriatric assessment, few prototype robots have already been developed in order  to measure and provide real-time information, concerning elderly daily  activities. Cognitive impairment and alterations on daily functions should be  immediate recognized from caregivers, in order to be prevented and probably  treated. In this chapter we recognize the necessity of artificial robots during  the personal service of the elderly population, not only as a mobile  laboratory-geriatrician, but mainly as a socialized digital humanoid able to  develop social behavior and activate memories and emotions.

AB  - PURPOSE: Demographic change has resulted in an increase of elderly people, while at the same time the number of active working people is falling. In the future,  there will be less caretaking, which is necessary to support the aging  population. In order to enable the aged population to live in dignity, they  should be able to perform activities of daily living (ADLs) as independently as  possible. The aim of this paper is to describe several solutions and concepts  that can support elderly people in their ADLs in a way that allows them to stay  self-sufficient for as long as possible. METHOD: To reach this goal, the Building  Realization and Robotics Lab is researching in the field of ambient assisted  living. The idea is to implement robots and sensors in the home environment so as  to efficiently support the inhabitants in their ADLs and eventually increase  their independence. Through embedding vital sensors into furniture and using ICT  technologies, the health status of elderly people can be remotely evaluated by a  physician or family members. By investigating ergonomic aspects specific to  elderly people (e.g. via an age-simulation suit), it is possible to develop and  test new concepts and novel applications, which will offer innovative solutions.  Via the introduction of mechatronics and robotics, the home environment can be  made able to seamlessly interact with the inhabitant through gestures, vocal  commands, and visual recognition algorithms. Meanwhile, several solutions have  been developed that address how to build a smart home environment in order to  create an ambient assisted environment. This article describes how these concepts  were developed. The approach for each concept, proposed in this article, was  performed as follows: (1) research of needs, (2) creating definitions of  requirements, (3) identification of necessary technology and processes, (4)  building initial concepts, (5) experiments in a real environment, and (6)  development of the final concepts. To keep these concepts cost-effective, the  suggested solutions are modular. Therefore, it will be possible to  straightforwardly install the proposed devices in an existing home environment in  a 'plug and play' manner once the terminals can be prefabricated off-site.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: This article shows a variety of concepts that have been  developed to support elderly people in their ADLs. The prototypes of the proposed  concepts in this paper have been tested with elderly people. The results of the  tests show that robots embedded in furniture, walls, ceiling, etc. offer enhanced  support, properly addressing elderly as well as disabled people to individually  and independently manage their ADLs. In order to make the concepts realizable in  terms of cost, it will be necessary to standardize and modularize these concepts  for industrial fabrication.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This research identifies specific care coordination activities used by Aging in Place (AIP) nurse care coordinators and home healthcare (HHC) nurses  when coordinating care for older community-dwelling adults and suggests a method  to quantify care coordination. METHODS: A care coordination ontology was built  based on activities extracted from 11,038 notes labeled with the Omaha Case  management category. From the parsed narrative notes of every patient, we mapped  the extracted activities to the ontology, from which we computed problem profiles  and quantified care coordination for all patients. RESULTS: We compared two  groups of patients: AIP who received enhanced care coordination (n=217) and HHC  who received traditional care (n=691) using 128,135 narratives notes. Patients  were tracked from the time they were admitted to AIP or HHC until they were  discharged. We found that patients in AIP received a higher dose of care  coordination than HHC in most Omaha problems, with larger doses being given in  AIP than in HHC in all four Omaha categories. CONCLUSIONS: 'Communicate' and  'manage' activities are widely used in care coordination. This confirmed the  expert hypothesis that nurse care coordinators spent most of their time  communicating about their patients and managing problems. Overall, nurses  performed care coordination in both AIP and HHC, but the aggregated dose across  Omaha problems and categories is larger in AIP.

TI  - The determinants of home healthcare robots adoption: an empirical investigation.
AU  - Alaiad, Ahmad
AU  - Zhou, Lina
T2  - International journal of medical informatics
AB  - BACKGROUND: Home healthcare robots promise to make clinical information available at the right place and time, thereby reducing error and increasing safety and  quality. However, it has been frequently reported that more than 40% of previous  information technology (IT) developments have failed or been abandoned due to the  lack of understanding of the sociotechnical aspects of IT. OBJECTIVE: Previous  home healthcare robots research has focused on technology development and  clinical applications. There has been little discussion of associated social,  technical and managerial issues that are arguably of equal importance for robot  success. To fill this knowledge gap, this research aims to understand the  determinants of home healthcare robots adoption from these aspects by applying  technology acceptance theories. METHODS: We employed both qualitative and  quantitative methods. The participants were recruited from home healthcare  agencies located in the U.S. (n=108), which included both patients and healthcare  professionals. We collected data via a survey study to test a research model.  RESULTS: The usage intention of home healthcare robots is a function of social  influence, performance expectancy, trust, privacy concerns, ethical concerns and  facilitating conditions. Among them, social influence is the strongest predictor.  Monitoring vital signs and facilitating communication with family and medication  reminders are the most preferable tasks and applications for robots. CONCLUSION:  Sociotechnical factors play a powerful role in explaining the adoption intention  for home healthcare robots. The findings provide insights on how home healthcare  service providers and robot designers may improve the success of robot  technologies.

AB  - RATIONALE: More than a million polysomnograms (PSGs) are performed annually in the United States to diagnose obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Third-party payers  now advocate a home sleep test (HST), rather than an in-laboratory PSG, as the  diagnostic study for OSA regardless of clinical probability, but the economic  benefit of this approach is not known. OBJECTIVES: We determined the diagnostic  performance of OSA prediction tools including the newly developed OSUNet, based  on an artificial neural network, and performed a cost-minimization analysis when  the prediction tools are used to identify patients who should undergo HST.  METHODS: The OSUNet was trained to predict the presence of OSA in a derivation  group of patients who underwent an in-laboratory PSG (n = 383). Validation group  1 consisted of in-laboratory PSG patients (n = 149). The network was trained  further in 33 patients who underwent HST and then was validated in a separate  group of 100 HST patients (validation group 2). Likelihood ratios (LRs) were  compared with two previously published prediction tools. The total costs from the  use of the three prediction tools and the third-party approach within a clinical  algorithm were compared. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The OSUNet had a higher  +LR in all groups compared with the STOP-BANG and the modified neck circumference  (MNC) prediction tools. The +LRs for STOP-BANG, MNC, and OSUNet in validation  group 1 were 1.1 (1.0-1.2), 1.3 (1.1-1.5), and 2.1 (1.4-3.1); and in validation  group 2 they were 1.4 (1.1-1.7), 1.7 (1.3-2.2), and 3.4 (1.8-6.1), respectively.  With an OSA prevalence less than 52%, the use of all three clinical prediction  tools resulted in cost savings compared with the third-party approach.  CONCLUSIONS: The routine requirement of an HST to diagnose OSA regardless of  clinical probability is more costly compared with the use of OSA clinical  prediction tools that identify patients who should undergo this procedure when  OSA is expected to be present in less than half of the population. With OSA  prevalence less than 40%, the OSUNet offers the greatest savings, which are  substantial when the number of sleep studies done annually is considered.

T2  - Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)
AB  - Recent advancements in depth video sensors technologies have made human activity recognition (HAR) realizable for elderly monitoring applications. Although  conventional HAR utilizes RGB video sensors, HAR could be greatly improved with  depth video sensors which produce depth or distance information. In this paper, a  depth-based life logging HAR system is designed to recognize the daily activities  of elderly people and turn these environments into an intelligent living space.  Initially, a depth imaging sensor is used to capture depth silhouettes. Based on  these silhouettes, human skeletons with joint information are produced which are  further used for activity recognition and generating their life logs. The  life-logging system is divided into two processes. Firstly, the training system  includes data collection using a depth camera, feature extraction and training  for each activity via Hidden Markov Models. Secondly, after training, the  recognition engine starts to recognize the learned activities and produces life  logs. The system was evaluated using life logging features against principal  component and independent component features and achieved satisfactory  recognition rates against the conventional approaches. Experiments conducted on  the smart indoor activity datasets and the MSRDailyActivity3D dataset show  promising results. The proposed system is directly applicable to any elderly  monitoring system, such as monitoring healthcare problems for elderly people, or  examining the indoor activities of people at home, office or hospital.

TI  - Home care technology through an ability expectation lens.
AU  - Wolbring, Gregor

T2  - Journal of medical Internet research
AB  - Home care is on the rise, and its delivery is increasingly reliant on an expanding variety of health technologies ranging from computers to telephone  "health apps" to social robots. These technologies are most often predicated on  expectations that people in their homes (1) can actively interact with these  technologies and (2) are willing to submit to the action of the technology in  their home. Our purpose is to use an "ability expectations" lens to bring  together, and provide some synthesis of, the types of utility and disadvantages  that can arise for people with disabilities in relation to home care technology  development and use. We searched the academic databases Scopus, Web of Science,  EBSCO ALL, IEEE Xplore, and Compendex to collect articles that had the term "home  care technology" in the abstract or as a topic (in the case of Web of Science).  We also used our background knowledge and related academic literature pertaining  to self-diagnosis, health monitoring, companionship, health information  gathering, and care. We examined background articles and articles collected  through our home care technology search in terms of ability expectations assumed  in the presentation of home care technologies, or discussed in relation to home  care technologies. While advances in health care support are made possible  through emerging technologies, we urge critical examination of such technologies  in terms of implications for the rights and dignity of people with diverse  abilities. Specifically, we see potential for technologies to result in new forms  of exclusion and powerlessness. Ableism influences choices made by funders,  policy makers, and the public in the development and use of home health  technologies and impacts how people with disabilities are served and how useful  health support technologies will be for them. We urge continued critical  examination of technology development and use according to ability expectations,  and we recommend increasing incorporation of participatory design processes to  counteract potential for health support technology to render people with  disabilities technologically excluded and powerless.

AB  - Even though there is a constant and accelerating growth of the aging population worldwide, such a rapid rise is negatively impacting available home and community  services not able to encompass the necessities associated with the increased  number of older people. In particular, there are increasing demands on e-health  care services and smart technologies needed for frail elders with chronic  diseases and also for those experiencing active aging. Advanced Technology Care  Innovation for older persons encompasses all sectors (assistive technology,  robotics, home automation, and home care- and institution-based healthcare  monitoring, telemedicine) dedicated to promoting health and wellbeing in all  types of living environments. Considering that there is a large concern and  demand by older persons to remain in familiar social living surroundings, study  projects joined with industries have been currently initiated, especially across  Europe to improve health and wellbeing. This article will highlight the latest  updates in Europe and, in particular in Italy, regarding scientific projects  dedicated to unraveling how diverse needs can be translated into an up-to-date  technology innovation for the growing elder population. We will provide  information regarding advanced technology designed for those with specific  geriatric-correlated conditions in familiar living settings and for individuals  aging actively. This is an important action because numerous emerging  developments are based on user needs identified by geriatricians, thus,  underlining the indispensable role of geriatric medicine toward future guidelines  on specific technology.

AB  - This paper presents the sensor network infrastructure for a home care system that allows long-term monitoring of physiological data and everyday activities. The  aim of the proposed system is to allow the elderly to live longer in their home  without compromising safety and ensuring the detection of health problems. The  system offers the possibility of a virtual visit via a teleoperated robot. During  the visit, physiological data and activities occurring during a period of time  can be discussed. These data are collected from physiological sensors (e.g.,  temperature, blood pressure, glucose) and environmental sensors (e.g., motion,  bed/chair occupancy, electrical usage). The system can also give alarms if sudden  problems occur, like a fall, and warnings based on more long-term trends, such as  the deterioration of health being detected. It has been implemented and tested in  a test environment and has been deployed in six real homes for a year-long  evaluation. The key contribution of the paper is the presentation of an  implemented system for ambient assisted living (AAL) tested in a real  environment, combining the acquisition of sensor data, a flexible and adaptable  middleware compliant with the OSGistandard and a context recognition application.  The system has been developed in a European project called GiraffPlus.

AB  - Collision avoidance technology has the capacity to facilitate safer mobility among older power mobility users with physical, sensory, and cognitive  impairments, thus enabling independence for more users. Little is known about  consumers' perceptions of collision avoidance. This article draws on interviews  (29 users, 5 caregivers, and 10 prescribers) to examine views on design and  utilization of this technology. Data analysis identified three themes: "useful  situations or contexts," "technology design issues and real-life application,"  and "appropriateness of collision avoidance technology for a variety of users."  Findings support ongoing development of collision avoidance for older adult  users. The majority of participants supported the technology and felt that it  might benefit current users and users with visual impairments, but might be  unsuitable for people with significant cognitive impairments. Some participants  voiced concerns regarding the risk for injury with power mobility use and some  identified situations where collision avoidance might be beneficial (driving  backward, avoiding dynamic obstacles, negotiating outdoor barriers, and learning  power mobility use). Design issues include the need for context awareness,  reliability, and user interface specifications. User desire to maintain driving  autonomy supports development of collaboratively controlled systems. This  research lays the groundwork for future development by illustrating consumer  requirements for this technology.

AB  - We present an approach for personalizing nonpharmacological interventions for people with dementia (PwD) using ontologies. We conducted two case studies to  derive an ontological model to personalize the planning and execution of  interventions to address problematic behaviors. The paper describes how the  ontology was derived, and illustrates how it is used to tailor an  ambient-assisted intervention system (AAIS) at two stages: first, to decide on  the services that the AAIS will offer the PwD, and then to adapt these services  at runtime using contextual information. The results of a deployment of an AAIS  during 2 months in the home of a PwD, indicate that the AAIS successfully  addressed some of the problematic behaviors exhibited by the PwD, helping to  reduce the burden of the caregiver.

AB  - The growing number of elderly individuals presents new challenges for society. Many elderly individuals have physical or cognitive impairments and require  support from caregivers. An attempt to overcome the limitations caused by the  lack of human caregivers is the inclusion of assistive technology such as  socially active robots. The Domeo-project of the Ambient Assisted Living Joint  Programme of the European Union aims to develop a new companion robotic system  that would allow assistance to the elderly. The requirements and attitude of the  potential users and caregivers have been assessed in Austria, France and Hungary.  The robot functions were demonstrated to the participants. Three focus groups  were formed: potential end users, older caregivers and younger caregivers. The  discussions were recorded and processed according to six aspects: (i)  acceptability and privacy, (ii) pertinence of services, (iii) possible obstacles,  (iv) motivation level to use the proposed services, (v) organizational issues and  (vi) recommendations. Minor differences were observed between the countries, but  there were considerable differences regarding the age of the participants. The  younger caregivers want to be assured of the safety of their client and to  receive immediate notification in case of an emergency. As for the elderly, the  most important aspect is to gain a companion and a physical helper. Many of the  recommendations can be taken into consideration during robot development, but  some of them are not realistic at present.

AB  - Home oxygen therapy (HOT) is a medical treatment for the patients suffering from severe lung diseases. Although walking outdoors is recommended for the patients  to maintain physical strength, the patients always have to carry a portable  oxygen supplier which is not sufficiently light weight for this purpose. Our  ultimate goal is to develop a mobile robot to carry an oxygen tank and follow a  patient in an urban outdoor environment. We have proposed a mobile robot with a  tether interface to detect the relative position of the foregoing patient. In  this paper, we report the questionnaire-based evaluation about the two developed  prototypes by the HOT patients. We conduct maneuvering experiments, and then  obtained questionnaire-based evaluations from the 20 patients. The results show  that the basic following performance is sufficient and the pulling force of the  tether is sufficiently small for the patients. Moreover, the patients prefer the  small-sized prototype for compactness and light weight to the middle-sized  prototype which can carry larger payload. We also obtained detailed requests to  improve the robots. Finally the results show the general concept of the robot is  favorably received by the patients.

AB  - The most common injuries in healthcare are related to transfers. The Strong Arm system assists caregivers in providing fully dependent transfers from an electric  power wheelchair to a bed, shower bench, toilet or other surface. However, this  system currently controlled by buttons could be more successful with a more  intuitive method during use. This paper presents the initial development of  direct interaction for a robotic transfer system called Strong Arm. Direct  interaction was used to make a transfer system more intuitive to operate using a  three-axis load cell. To move Strong Arm, the user must apply intentional force  on any of the given axes by surpassing the axis threshold. Unintentional movement  could lead to injury. The results indicate that the thresholds for each axis were  at least 3.5 N in X, 16.9 N in Y and 5.3N in Z in order to prevent unintentional  forces from a human hand that would cause the robot to move.

T2  - IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics
AB  - This paper presents the design and implementation of an architecture based on the combination of ontologies, rules, web services, and the autonomic computing  paradigm to manage data in home-based telemonitoring scenarios. The architecture  includes two layers: 1) a conceptual layer and 2) a data and communication layer.  On the one hand, the conceptual layer based on ontologies is proposed to unify  the management procedure and integrate incoming data from all the sources  involved in the telemonitoring process. On the other hand, the data and  communication layer based on REST web service (WS) technologies is proposed to  provide practical backup to the use of the ontology, to provide a real  implementation of the tasks it describes and thus to provide a means of  exchanging data (support communication tasks). A case study regarding chronic  obstructive pulmonary disease data management is presented in order to evaluate  the efficiency of the architecture. This proposed ontology-based solution defines  a flexible and scalable architecture in order to address main challenges  presented in home-based telemonitoring scenarios and thus provide a means to  integrate, unify, and transfer data supporting both clinical and technical  management tasks.

AB  - PURPOSE: In light of the increasing elderly population and the growing demand for home care, the potential of robot support is given increasing attention. In this  paper, an inventory of activities was made that threaten independent living of  elderly when becoming problematic. Results will guide the further development of  an existing service robot, the Care-O-bot®. METHOD: A systematic literature  search of PubMed was performed, focused on the risk factors for  institutionalization. Additionally, focus group sessions were conducted in the  Netherlands, United Kingdom and France. In these focus group sessions,  problematic activities threatening the independence of elderly people were  discussed. Three separate target groups were included in the focus group  sessions: (1) elderly persons (n = 41), (2) formal caregivers (n = 40) and (3)  informal caregivers (n = 32). RESULTS: Activities within the International  Classification of Functioning domains mobility, self-care, and interpersonal  interaction and relationships were found to be the most problematic. CONCLUSIONS:  A distinct set of daily activities was identified that may threaten independent  living, but no single activity could be selected as the main activity causing a  loss of independence as it is often a combination of problematic activities that  is person-specific. Supporting the problematic activities need not involve a  robotic solution.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate whether the rehabilitation outcomes with robotic-aided gait therapy may be affected by patients' and  caregivers' psychologic features after subacute stroke. DESIGN: This is a  controlled, longitudinal, observational pilot study conducted on 42 patients  divided in robotic-assisted gait training plus conventional physical therapy  group, robotic-assisted gait training dropout group, and conventional physical  therapy group. The outcome measures were walking ability (Functional Ambulation  Category) and independency in activities of daily living (Barthel Index) measured  before and after intervention. Psychologic features were measured before  intervention using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Eysenck  Personality Questionnaire, and recovery locus of control in the patients and the  State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and the Beck Depression Inventory in the  caregivers. RESULTS: Patient anxiety was significantly higher in those who  refused/abandoned robotic therapy (P = 0.002). In the subjects allocated to the  robotic group, the recovery of walking ability was significantly affected by the  perceived recovery locus of control (P = 0.039, odds ratio = 14); and the  recovery of independency in activities of daily living, by anxiety (P = 0.018,  odds ratio = 0.042). Conversely, psychologic factors did not significantly affect  the outcomes of conventional rehabilitation. CONCLUSIONS: Psychologic features,  particularly recovery locus of control and anxiety, affected the rehabilitative  outcomes of the patients involved in robotic treatment more than those in  conventional rehabilitation.

T2  - Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Expert systems have been widely used in medical and healthcare practice for various purposes. In addition to vital sign data, important concerns  in telehealthcare include the compliance with the measurement prescription, the  accuracy of vital sign measurements, and the functioning of vital sign meters and  home gateways. However, few expert system applications are found in the  telehealthcare domain to address these issues. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This  article presents an expert system application for one of the largest  commercialized telehealthcare practices in Taiwan by Min-Sheng General Hospital.  The main function of the Telehealthcare Expert System (TES) developed in this  research is to detect and classify events based on the measurement data  transmitted to the database at the call center, including abnormality of vital  signs, violation of vital sign measurement prescriptions, and malfunction of  hardware devices (home gateway and vital sign meter). When the expert system  detects an abnormal event, it assigns an "urgent degree" and alerts the nursing  team in the call center to take action, such as phoning the patient for  counseling or to urge the patient to return to the hospital for further tests.  RESULTS: During 2 years of clinical practice, from 2009 to 2011, 19,182 patients  were served by the expert system. The expert system detected 41,755 events, of  which 22.9% indicated abnormality of vital signs, 75.2% indicated violation of  measurement prescription, and 1.9% indicated malfunction of devices. On average,  the expert system reduced by 76.5% the time that the nursing team in the call  center spent in handling the events. CONCLUSIONS: The expert system helped to  reduce cost and improve quality of the telehealthcare service.

AB  - System for Autonomy and Care for Dependency (Spanish acronym SAAD) was created to provide a framework for the protection of dependent people. The priority  established by law on benefits in kind over cash benefits, together with the  efficient management of public resources provided economic returns for the SAAD,  such as employment generation. The variables that influence the implementation of  the SAAD are extremely complex and dynamic, and there are multiple relationships  between them. The aim of this paper is to analyze the problem of satisfying a  growing demand for protection, at minimum cost, and reaps the economic returns  using fuzzy logic (fuzzy cognitive map). This technique is designed as a tool for  decision-making in this area, to analyze the evolution of causal variables to a  state of equilibrium. To do this, we have developed 4 scenarios (E1: Ageing, E2:  Ageing and benefits in kind, E3: Ageing and cash benefits, E4: Ageing and cash  benefit for care in the family), to analyze the evolution of variables,  especially public expenditure and employment. Among the main results are: ageing  is critical for the increased spending in all scenarios, but only in E1 and E2 is  generated employment, residential care is not altered, even in E2; Telecare  increases in all scenarios, and the cash benefit for personal attendant increases  in E1 and E2.

AB  - Currently, healthcare costs associated with aging at home can be prohibitive if individuals require continual/periodical supervision and assistance because of  Alzheimer's disease. Open-source tools and videoconferencing tools are attracting  more significant organizations; it has been observed that another way to reduce  medical care costs is to reduce the length of the patient's hospitalization and  reinforce home sanitary support by medical professionals with family care givers.  Videoconferencing has been around for a while and presently this technology is  the leading way in reducing healthcare costs, thus making medical care more  available and convenient for both doctors and patients. This article portrays how  the videoconferencing tool can be utilized to improve communication practices for  patient monitoring using a Robot Companion. SWOT analysis method is also  presented in a form of a summary and was utilized to evaluate the user's point of  view.

AB  - This study develops and integrates an efficient knowledge-based system and a component-based framework to design an intelligent and flexible home health care  system. The proposed knowledge-based system integrates an efficient rule-based  reasoning model and flexible knowledge rules for determining efficiently and  rapidly the necessary physiological and medication treatment procedures based on  software modules, video camera sensors, communication devices, and physiological  sensor information. This knowledge-based system offers high flexibility for  improving and extending the system further to meet the monitoring demands of new  patient and caregiver health care by updating the knowledge rules in the  inference mechanism. All of the proposed functional components in this study are  reusable, configurable, and extensible for system developers. Based on the  experimental results, the proposed intelligent homecare system demonstrates that  it can accomplish the extensible, customizable, and configurable demands of the  ubiquitous healthcare systems to meet the different demands of patients and  caregivers under various rehabilitation and nursing conditions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Remote telepresence provided by tele-operated robotics represents a new means for obtaining important health information, improving older adults'  social and daily functioning and providing peace of mind to family members and  caregivers who live remotely. In this study we tested the feasibility of use and  acceptance of a remotely controlled robot with video-communication capability in  independently living, cognitively intact older adults. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A  mobile remotely controlled robot with video-communication ability was placed in  the homes of eight seniors. The attitudes and preferences of these volunteers and  those of family or friends who communicated with them remotely via the device  were assessed through survey instruments. RESULTS: Overall experiences were  consistently positive, with the exception of one user who subsequently progressed  to a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment. Responses from our participants  indicated that in general they appreciated the potential of this technology to  enhance their physical health and well-being, social connectedness, and ability  to live independently at home. Remote users, who were friends or adult children  of the participants, were more likely to test the mobility features and had  several suggestions for additional useful applications. CONCLUSIONS: Results from  the present study showed that a small sample of independently living, cognitively  intact older adults and their remote collaterals responded positively to a remote  controlled robot with video-communication capabilities. Research is needed to  further explore the feasibility and acceptance of this type of technology with a  variety of patients and their care contacts.

AB  - This secondary data analysis used data mining methods to develop predictive models of child risk for distress during a healthcare procedure. Data used came  from a study that predicted factors associated with children's responses to an  intravenous catheter insertion while parents provided distraction coaching. From  the 255 items used in the primary study, 44 predictive items were identified  through automatic feature selection and used to build support vector machine  regression models. Models were validated using multiple cross-validation tests  and by comparing variables identified as explanatory in the traditional versus  support vector machine regression. Rule-based approaches were applied to the  model outputs to identify overall risk for distress. A decision tree was then  applied to evidence-based instructions for tailoring distraction to  characteristics and preferences of the parent and child. The resulting decision  support computer application, titled Children, Parents and Distraction, is being  used in research. Future use will support practitioners in deciding the level and  type of distraction intervention needed by a child undergoing a healthcare  procedure.

AB  - AIM: This study investigated the attitudes and preferences of staff, residents and relatives of residents in a retirement village towards a health-care robot.  METHODS: Focus groups were conducted with residents, managers and caregivers, and  questionnaires were collected from 32 residents, 30 staff and 27 relatives of  residents. RESULTS: The most popular robot tasks were detection of falls and  calling for help, lifting, and monitoring location. Robot functionality was more  important than appearance. Concerns included the loss of jobs and personal care,  while perceived benefits included allowing staff to spend quality time with  residents, and helping residents with self-care. Residents showed a more positive  attitude towards robots than both staff and relatives. CONCLUSIONS: These results  provide an initial guide for the tasks and appearance appropriate for a robot to  provide assistance in aged care facilities and highlight concerns.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases are the most popular cause of death in the world recently. For postoperatives, cardiac rehabilitation is still asked to maintain  at home (phase II) to improve cardiac function. However, only one third of  outpatients do the exercise regularly, reflecting the difficulty for home-based  healthcare: lacking of monitoring and motivation. Hence, a cardio-pulmonary  rehabilitation system was proposed in this research to improve rehabilitation  efficiency for better prognosis. The proposed system was built on mobile phone  and receiving electrocardiograph (ECG) signal from a wireless ECG holter via  Bluetooth connection. Apart from heart rate (HR) monitor, an ECG derived  respiration (EDR) technique is also included to provide respiration rate (RR).  Both HR and RR are the most important vital signs during exercise but only used  one physiological signal recorder in this system. In clinical test, there were 15  subjects affording Bruce Task (treadmill) to simulate rehabilitation procedure.  Correlation between this system and commercial product (Custo-Med) was up to 98%  in HR and 81% in RR. Considering the prevention of sudden heart attack, an  arrhythmia detection expert system and healthcare server at the backend were also  integrated to this system for comprehensive cardio-pulmonary monitoring whenever  and wherever doing the exercise.

AB  - In this article, the authors examine whether and how robot caregivers can contribute to the welfare of children with various cognitive and physical  impairments by expanding recreational opportunities for these children. The  capabilities approach is used as a basis for informing the relevant discussion.  Though important in its own right, having the opportunity to play is essential to  the development of other capabilities central to human flourishing. Drawing from  empirical studies, the authors show that the use of various types of robots has  already helped some children with impairments. Recognizing the potential ethical  pitfalls of robot caregiver intervention, however, the authors examine these  concerns and conclude that an appropriately designed robot caregiver has the  potential to contribute positively to the development of the capability to play  while also enhancing the ability of human caregivers to understand and interact  with care recipients.

AB  - Computer-based approaches can add great value to the traditional paper-based approaches for cognitive rehabilitation. The management of a big amount of  stimuli and the use of multimedia features permits to improve the patient's  involvement and to reuse and recombine them to create new exercises, whose  difficulty level should be adapted to the patient's performance. This work  proposes an ontological organization of the stimuli, to support the automatic  generation of new exercises, tailored on the patient's preferences and skills,  and its integration into a commercial cognitive rehabilitation tool. The  possibilities offered by this approach are presented with the help of real  examples.

AB  - This study introduces the concept design and analysis of a robotic system for the assistance and rehabilitation of disabled people. Based on the statistical data  of the most common types of disabilities in Spain and other industrialized  countries, the different tasks that the device must be able to perform have been  determined. In this study, different robots for rehabilitation and assistance  previously introduced have been reviewed. This survey is focused on those robots  that assist with gait, balance and standing up. The structure of the ROAD robot  presents various advantages over these robots, we discuss some of them. The  performance of the proposed architecture is analyzed when it performs the sit to  stand activity.

AB  - Strokes affect thousands of people worldwide leaving sufferers with severe disabilities affecting their daily activities. In recent years, new  rehabilitation techniques have emerged such as constraint-induced therapy,  biofeedback therapy and robot-aided therapy. In particular, robotic techniques  allow precise recording of movements and application of forces to the affected  limb, making it a valuable tool for motor rehabilitation. In addition,  robot-aided therapy can utilise visual cues conveyed on a computer screen to  convert repetitive movement practice into an engaging task such as a game. Visual  cues can also be used to control the information sent to the patient about  exercise performance and to potentially address psychosomatic variables  influencing therapy. This paper overviews the current state-of-the-art on upper  limb robot-mediated therapy with a focal point on the technical requirements of  robotic therapy devices leading to the development of upper limb rehabilitation  techniques that facilitate reach-to-touch, fine motor control, whole-arm  movements and promote rehabilitation beyond hospital stay. The reviewed  literature suggest that while there is evidence supporting the use of this  technology to reduce functional impairment, besides the technological push, the  challenge ahead lies on provision of effective assessment of outcome and  modalities that have a stronger impact transferring functional gains into  functional independence.

AB  - The increasing number of people suffering from Alzheimer's disease raises the question of their caring at home, especially when the disease causes disability  and negative consequences in daily life such as isolation, falls, wandering,  errors in drug taking. Furthermore, caregivers bear a substantial burden that can  have adverse effects on their physical and mental health. New technologies of  information could play an additional role as care providers without substituting  family or professional caregivers help. A review of literature focused on the  different technological solutions conceived for patients suffering from  Alzheimer's disease and their carers shows that these appliances could help to  provide reminders in daily life (drugs, tasks and appointments, meals cooking),  to activate residual cognitive resources by computerized cognitive stimulation  intervention, to reduce stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms in patients by  visual contact with families and professionals (webconference), to contribute to  patients safety by detecting falls and wandering, and to help families in the  caring of patients with computerized information and counselling interventions.  We also discuss the current limitations for a widespread use of these  technologies and outline future research avenues. True needs of end-users are  still poorly known and should be more clearly defined. Simplicity of the use of  these appliances should be further improved. Demonstration of medical and social  benefits for elderly people should be carried out in randomized, controlled  studies. Ethical reflexion should be developed in conjunction with the use of  these gerontechnologies. Finally, the economical model which would enable the  providing of these appliances to the largest number of patients and caregivers  should be implemented. Although these gerontechnologies are promising, research  is still needed to tailor them properly to the needs of end-users, assess their  benefit in ecological context of people with Alzheimer's disease in order to  provide them with appropriate tools in daily life.

AB  - Stroke is a common, serious, and disabling global health-care problem, and rehabilitation is a major part of patient care. There is evidence to support  rehabilitation in well coordinated multidisciplinary stroke units or through  provision of early supported provision of discharge teams. Potentially beneficial  treatment options for motor recovery of the arm include constraint-induced  movement therapy and robotics. Promising interventions that could be beneficial  to improve aspects of gait include fitness training, high-intensity therapy, and  repetitive-task training. Repetitive-task training might also improve transfer  functions. Occupational therapy can improve activities of daily living; however,  information about the clinical effect of various strategies of cognitive  rehabilitation and strategies for aphasia and dysarthria is scarce. Several large  trials of rehabilitation practice and of novel therapies (eg, stem-cell therapy,  repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, virtual reality, robotic therapies,  and drug augmentation) are underway to inform future practice.

AB  - Web-based personal health records (PHRs) are under massive deployment. To improve PHR's capability and usability, we previously proposed the concept of intelligent  PHR (iPHR). By introducing and extending expert system technology and Web search  technology into the PHR domain, iPHR can automatically provide users with  personalized healthcare information to facilitate their daily activities of  living. Our iPHR system currently provides three functions: guided search for  disease information, recommendation of home nursing activities, and  recommendation of home medical products. This paper discusses our experience with  iPHR as well as the open issues, including both enhancements to the existing  functions and potential new functions. We outline some preliminary solutions,  whereas a main purpose of this paper is to stimulate future research work in the  area of consumer health informatics.

AB  - In incomplete spinal cord injured subjects, task-oriented training regimes are applied for enhancement of neuroplasticity to improve gait capacity. However, a  sufficient training intensity can only be achieved during the inpatient phase,  which is getting shorter and shorter due to economic restrictions. In the  clinical environment, complex and expensive robotic devices have been introduced  to maintain the duration and the intensity of the training, but up to now only a  few exist for continuation of automated locomotion training at home. For  continuation of the automated locomotion training at home prototypes of the  compact, pneumatically driven orthosis MoreGait have been realized, which  generate the key afferent stimuli for activation of the spinal gait pattern  generator. Artificial pneumatic muscles with excellent weight-to-force ratio and  safety characteristics have been integrated as joint actuators. Additionally, a  Stimulative Shoe for generation of the appropriate foot loading pattern has been  developed without the need for verticalization of the user. The first results of  the pilot study in eight chronic incomplete spinal cord injured subjects indicate  that the home-based therapy is safe and feasible. The therapy related  improvements of the walking capacity are in the range of locomotion robots used  in clinical settings.

AB  - Continuous care models for chronic diseases pose several technology-oriented challenges for home-based care, where assistance services rely on a close  collaboration among different stakeholders, such as health operators, patient  relatives, and social community members. This paper describes an ontology-based  context model and a related context management system providing a configurable  and extensible service-oriented framework to ease the development of applications  for monitoring and handling patient chronic conditions. The system has been  developed in a prototypal version, and integrated with a service platform for  supporting operators of home-based care networks in cooperating and sharing  patient-related information and coordinating mutual interventions for handling  critical and alarm situations. Finally, we discuss experimentation results and  possible further research directions.

Our vision assessment study aims for more distinguished and more informed visions  on future robots. Surprisingly, our experiment also led to some promising  co-designed robot concepts in which jointly articulated moral guidelines are  embedded. With our model, we think to have designed an interesting response on a  recent call for a less speculative ethics of technology by encouraging  discussions about the quality of positive and negative visions on the future of  robotics.

T2  - Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society
AB  - How does an infant learn through visual experience to imitate actions of adult teachers, despite the fact that the infant and adult view one another and the  world from different perspectives? To accomplish this, an infant needs to learn  how to share joint attention with adult teachers and to follow their gaze towards  valued goal objects. The infant also needs to be capable of view-invariant object  learning and recognition whereby it can carry out goal-directed behaviors, such  as the use of tools, using different object views than the ones that its teachers  use. Such capabilities are often attributed to "mirror neurons". This attribution  does not, however, explain the brain processes whereby these competences arise.  This article describes the CRIB (Circular Reactions for Imitative Behavior)  neural model of how the brain achieves these goals through inter-personal  circular reactions. Inter-personal circular reactions generalize the  intra-personal circular reactions of Piaget, which clarify how infants learn from  their own babbled arm movements and reactive eye movements how to carry out  volitional reaches, with or without tools, towards valued goal objects. The  article proposes how intra-personal circular reactions create a foundation for  inter-personal circular reactions when infants and other learners interact with  external teachers in space. Both types of circular reactions involve learned  coordinate transformations between body-centered arm movement commands and  retinotopic visual feedback, and coordination of processes within and between the  What and Where cortical processing streams. Specific breakdowns of model  processes generate formal symptoms similar to clinical symptoms of autism.

In this paper, we use automatic home medical product recommendation as a  concrete application to demonstrate the benefits of introducing intelligence into  PHRs. In this new application domain, we develop several techniques to address  the emerging challenges. Our approach uses treatment knowledge and nursing  knowledge, and extends the language modeling method to (1) construct a  topic-selection input interface for recommending home medical products, (2)  produce a global ranking of Web pages retrieved by multiple queries, and (3)  provide diverse search results.

We use a method based on color and shape to  detect the body parts and the medication bottles. Color is used for skin  detection, and the shape is used to distinguish the face from the hands and to  differentiate bottles of medicine. To track these objects, we use a method based  on color histograms, Hu moments, and edges. For the recognition of medication  intake, we use a Petri network and event recognition. Our method has an accuracy  of more than 75% and allows the detection of the medication intake in various  scenarios where the user is cooperative.

T2  - International journal of medical informatics
AB  - PURPOSE: Information Technologies and Knowledge-based Systems can significantly improve the management of complex distributed health systems, where supporting  multidisciplinarity is crucial and communication and synchronization between the  different professionals and tasks becomes essential. This work proposes the use  of the ontological paradigm to describe the organizational knowledge of such  complex healthcare institutions as a basis to support their management. The  ontology engineering process is detailed, as well as the way to maintain the  ontology updated in front of changes. The paper also analyzes how such an  ontology can be exploited in a real healthcare application and the role of the  ontology in the customization of the system. The particular case of senior Home  Care assistance is addressed, as this is a highly distributed field as well as a  strategic goal in an ageing Europe. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The proposed ontology  design is based on a Home Care medical model defined by an European consortium of  Home Care professionals, framed in the scope of the K4Care European project  (FP6). Due to the complexity of the model and the knowledge gap existing between  the - textual - medical model and the strict formalization of an ontology, an  ontology engineering methodology (On-To-Knowledge) has been followed. RESULTS:  After applying the On-To-Knowledge steps, the following results were obtained:  the feasibility study concluded that the ontological paradigm and the  expressiveness of modern ontology languages were enough to describe the required  medical knowledge; after the kick-off and refinement stages, a complete and  non-ambiguous definition of the Home Care model, including its main components  and interrelations, was obtained; the formalization stage expressed HC medical  entities in the form of ontological classes, which are interrelated by means of  hierarchies, properties and semantically rich class restrictions; the evaluation,  carried out by exploiting the ontology into a knowledge-driven e-health  application running on a real scenario, showed that the ontology design and its  exploitation brought several benefits with regards to flexibility, adaptability  and work efficiency from the end-user point of view; for the maintenance stage,  two software tools are presented, aimed to address the incorporation and  modification of healthcare units and the personalization of ontological profiles.  CONCLUSIONS: The paper shows that the ontological paradigm and the expressiveness  of modern ontology languages can be exploited not only to represent terminology  in a non-ambiguous way, but also to formalize the interrelations and  organizational structures involved in a real and distributed healthcare  environment. This kind of ontologies facilitates the adaptation in front of  changes in the healthcare organization or Care Units, supports the creation of  profile-based interaction models in a transparent and seamless way, and increases  the reusability and generality of the developed software components. As a  conclusion of the exploitation of the developed ontology in a real medical  scenario, we can say that an ontology formalizing organizational interrelations  is a key component for building effective distributed knowledge-driven e-health  systems.

Yet the data derived from these  technologies do not directly address the clinical aims of health care providers.  We conducted focus groups with health care providers who work with older adults  to elicit their perspectives on monitoring technologies. Identified themes  centered around the benefits and risks of technologies, patient needs, the  clinical utility of information, and specific monitoring domains that might  improve the health care of older adults. Providers highlighted the primary  importance of involving families and caregivers, and of sustaining human  interactions. They explored the difficulties with how to use information for  clinical ends, and challenged the notion that more objective information would  automatically improve their heath care. Designers, developers, and researchers  might improve the utility and uptake of health-related technologies for older  adults and their families by eliciting the viewpoints of clinical providers.

T2  - Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society. IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society. Annual International  Conference
AB  - Two distinct approaches to smart home design, namely Distributed Direct Sensing (DDS) and Infrastructure Mediated Sensing (IMS), have distinguishing features and  implications resulting from their implementation. These two distinct smart home  approaches have not been directly compared pertaining to their technical  performance or their acceptance by the end users. It is also unclear what the  perceived privacy and obtrusiveness concerns are when it comes to the  implementation of these two different approaches in homes. The study presented  here aimed to evaluate acceptance of these two sensing approaches by older adults  and assess the perceived privacy and obtrusiveness concerns and ultimately define  their social implications.

TI  - Passive in-home health and wellness monitoring: overview, value and examples.
AU  - Alwan, Majd
T2  - Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society. IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society. Annual International  Conference
AB  - Modern sensor and communication technology, coupled with advances in data analysis and artificial intelligence techniques, is causing a paradigm shift in  remote management and monitoring of chronic disease. In-home monitoring  technology brings the added benefit of measuring individualized health status and  reporting it to the care provider and caregivers alike, allowing timely and  targeted preventive interventions, even in home and community based settings.  This paper presents a paradigm for geriatric care based on monitoring older  adults passively in their own living settings through placing sensors in their  living environments or the objects they use. Activity and physiological data can  be analyzed, archived and mined to detect indicators of early disease onset or  changes in health conditions at various levels. Examples of monitoring systems  are discussed and results from field evaluation pilot studies are summarized. The  approach has shown great promise for a significant value proposition to all the  stakeholders involved in caring for older adults. The paradigm would allow care  providers to extend their services into the communities they serve.

AB  - With the obvious eldercare capabilities of smart environments it is a question of "when", rather than "if", these technologies will be routinely integrated into  the design of future houses. In the meantime, health monitoring applications must  be integrated into already complete home environments. However, there is  significant effort involved in installing the hardware necessary to monitor the  movements of an elder throughout an environment. Our work seeks to address the  high infrastructure requirements of traditional location-based smart home systems  by developing an extremely low infrastructure localisation technique. A study of  the most efficient method of obtaining calibration data for an environment is  conducted and different mobile devices are compared for localisation accuracy and  cost trade-off. It is believed that these developments will contribute towards  more efficiently deployed location-based smart home systems.

AB  - This paper outlines an approach that we are taking for elder-care applications in the smart home, involving cognitive errors and their compensation. Our approach  involves high level modeling of daily activities of the elderly by breaking down  these activities into smaller units, which can then be automatically recognized  at a low level by collections of sensors placed in the homes of the elderly. This  separation allows us to employ plan recognition algorithms and systems at a high  level, while developing stand-alone activity recognition algorithms and systems  at a low level. It also allows the mixing and matching of multi-modality sensors  of various kinds that go to support the same high level requirement. Currently  our plan recognition algorithms are still at a conceptual stage, whereas a number  of low level activity recognition algorithms and systems have been developed.  Herein we present our model for plan recognition, providing a brief survey of the  background literature. We also present some concrete results that we have  achieved for activity recognition, emphasizing how these results are incorporated  into the overall plan recognition system.

AB  - To address an aging population, we have been investigating sensor networks for monitoring older adults in their homes. In this paper, we report ongoing work in  which passive sensor networks have been installed in 17 apartments in an aging in  place eldercare facility. The network under development includes simple motion  sensors, video sensors, and a bed sensor that captures sleep restlessness and  pulse and respiration levels. Data collection has been ongoing for over two years  in some apartments. This longevity in sensor data collection is allowing us to  study the data and develop algorithms for identifying alert conditions such as  falls, as well as extracting typical daily activity patterns for an individual.  The goal is to capture patterns representing physical and cognitive health  conditions and then recognize when activity patterns begin to deviate from the  norm. In doing so, we strive to provide early detection of potential problems  which may lead to serious health events if left unattended. We describe the  components of the network and show examples of logged sensor data with correlated  references to health events. A summary is also included on the challenges  encountered and the lessons learned as a result of our experiences in monitoring  aging adults in their homes.

AB  - Smart Homes offer potential solutions for various forms of independent living for the elderly. The assistive and protective environment afforded by smart homes  offer a safe, relatively inexpensive, dependable and viable alternative to  vulnerable inhabitants. Nevertheless, the success of a smart home rests upon the  quality of information its decision support system receives and this in turn  places great importance on the issue of correct sensor deployment. In this  article we present a software tool that has been developed to address the elusive  issue of sensor distribution within smart homes. Details of the tool will be  presented and it will be shown how it can be used to emulate any real world  environment whereby virtual sensor distributions can be rapidly implemented and  assessed without the requirement for physical deployment for evaluation. As such,  this approach offers the potential of tailoring sensor distributions to the  specific needs of a patient in a non-evasive manner. The heuristics based tool  presented here has been developed as the first part of a three stage project.

AB  - The pervasive sensing technologies found in smart homes offer unprecedented opportunities for providing health monitoring and assistance to individuals  experiencing difficulties living independently at home. In order to monitor the  functional health of smart home residents, we need to design technologies that  recognize and track the activities that people perform at home. Machine learning  techniques can perform this task, but the software algorithms rely upon large  amounts of sample data that is correctly labeled with the corresponding activity.  Labeling, or annotating, sensor data with the corresponding activity can be time  consuming, may require input from the smart home resident, and is often  inaccurate. Therefore, in this paper we investigate four alternative mechanisms  for annotating sensor data with a corresponding activity label. We evaluate the  alternative methods along the dimensions of annotation time, resident burden, and  accuracy using sensor data collected in a real smart apartment.

AB  - A pilot study was done to address the efficacy of a General Packet Radio Service mobile phone-based telemedicine system used to improve follow-up after ambulatory  surgery. The method involves sending images of surgical wounds or other areas  from the patient's home, to assess local complications and avoid unnecessary  hospital visits. Ninety-six (N = 96) patients were enrolled in the study. The  phone used was a Nokia 6600, which provides images in Joint Photographic Experts  Group format. These images were sent via e-mail and visualized on a standard  17-inch screen of a personal computer. After the follow-up period, self-reported  patient satisfaction was assessed by analyzing the replies to a 9-item  questionnaire. Thirty of the 96 patients (31.3%) reported local problems  including: hematoma in 20 (66.7%) patients, surgical bandage blood-stained in 7  (23.3%), exudates in 1 (3.3%), allergic skin reactions in 1 (3.3%), and bandage  too tight in 1 (3.3%). In total, 225 photographs were evaluated by 3 physicians.  In all cases, it was possible to identify and assess the postoperative problem  with consensus among the 3 physicians. Images served to resolve patients'  concerns in 20 individuals (66.7%). In 10 patients (33.3%), concerns were  satisfied but it was suggested that follow-up images be sent in the following  days. Only 1 patient (3.3%) was asked to visit the hospital. The telemedicine  system proposed increases the efficiency of home follow-up to ambulatory surgery,  avoids unnecessary hospital visits, and clearly improves patient satisfaction.

AB  - Older people are an important and growing sector of the population. This demographic change raises the profile of frailty and disability within the  world's population. In such conditions, many old people need aides to perform  daily activities. Most of the support is given by family members who are now a  new target in the therapeutic approach. With advances in technology, robotics  becomes increasingly important as a means of supporting older people at home. In  order to ensure appropriate technology, 30 caregivers filled out a  self-administered questionnaire including questions on needs to support their  proxy and requirements concerning the robotic agent's functions and modes of  action. This paper points out the functions to be integrated into the robot in  order to support caregivers in the care of their proxy. The results also show  that caregivers have a positive attitude towards robotic agents.

AB  - Robot assisted therapy is a new and promising area in stroke rehabilitation and has shown to be effective in reducing motor impairment, but is a costly solution  for home rehabilitation. High medical costs could be reduced if we could improve  rehabilitation exercise in unsupervised environments such as the home. Hence,  there is an augmented need for a cost effective rehabilitation system that can be  used outside the clinic. This paper presents the design concept for an autonomous  robotic assistant that is low-cost and effective in engaging the users while  assisting them with therapy in any under-supervised area. We investigated how the  robot assistant can support TheraDrive, our low-cost therapy system. We present  the design methods and a case study demonstrating the arm and video collection  system.

AB  - Falls are among the leading causes for morbidity, mortality and lasting functional disability in the elderly population. Several studies have shown the  applicability of accelerometry to detect persons with a high fall risk. Most of  these studies have been conducted under laboratory settings and without clear  definition of 'fall risk' reference measures. The aim of our work is to provide a  simple unsupervised method to assess the fall risk of elderly persons as measured  by reference clinical fall risk assessment scores. Our method uses parameters  computed by spectral analysis on triaxial accelerometer data recorded in a  clinical setting, and is evaluated using simple logistic regression classifier  models with reference to three clinical reference scores. The overall prediction  accuracy of the models ranges from 65.5-89.1%, with sensitivity and specificity  between 78.5-99% and 15.4-60.4%, respectively. Our results show that our simple  method can be used to detect persons with a high fall risk with a fair to good  predictive accuracy when tested against common clinical reference scores. Our  parameters are independent of specific test procedures and therefore are suited  for use in an unsupervised setting. Our future research will include the  evaluation of our method in a large prospective study.

AB  - By its very nature, telehealth relies on technology. Throughout history, as new technologies emerged and afforded people the ability to send information across  distances, it was not long before this capability was applied to the most basic  need of all: maintaining health. While much of the early work in telehealth was  driven by technology (e.g., making opportunistic use of the systems and devices  that were available at the time), recent trends are beginning to push the demand  for and the development of new technologies specific to the individual needs of  telehealth applications. The future of telehealth will benefit greatly from this  technology innovation, in particular, in areas such as home telehealth and remote  monitoring, e-health and patient portal applications, personal health records,  interactive Internet technologies, and robotics. Telehealth, while not a panacea  for all of the challenges facing modern healthcare systems, has a substantial and  ever-expanding potential to revolutionize the ways in which people receive  medical care while offering the possibility to contain costs, manage chronic  diseases, and prevent secondary complications. By demanding innovative solutions  and speaking out in support of the field, the telehealth community can and should  be leading the charge for greater attention to human factors in technology  development, interoperable medical records, staff training and competencies,  standards and guidelines, and support for expanded telehealth coverage at the  national, state, and local levels.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many older adults with dementia require constant assistance from a caregiver when completing activities of daily living (ADL). This study examines  the efficacy of a computerized device intended to assist people with dementia  through ADL, while reducing caregiver burden. The device, called COACH, uses  artificial intelligence to autonomously guide an older adult with dementia  through the ADL using audio and/or audio-video prompts. METHODS: Six older adults  with moderate-to-severe dementia participated in this study. Handwashing was  chosen as the target ADL. A single subject research design was used with two  alternating baseline (COACH not used) and intervention (COACH used) phases. The  data were analyzed to investigate the impact of COACH on the participants'  independence and caregiver burden as well as COACH's overall performance for the  activity of handwashing. RESULTS: Participants with moderate-level dementia were  able to complete an average of 11% more handwashing steps independently and  required 60% fewer interactions with a human caregiver when COACH was in use.  Four of the participants achieved complete or very close to complete  independence. Interestingly, participants' MMSE scores did not appear to robustly  coincide with handwashing performance and/or responsiveness to COACH; other  idiosyncrasies of each individual seem to play a stronger role. While the  majority (78%) of COACH's actions were considered clinically correct, areas for  improvement were identified. CONCLUSION: The COACH system shows promise as a tool  to help support older adults with moderate-levels of dementia and their  caregivers. These findings reinforce the need for flexibility and dynamic  personalization in devices designed to assist older adults with dementia. After  addressing identified improvements, the authors plan to run clinical trials with  a sample of community-dwelling older adults and caregivers.

T2  - Journal of telemedicine and telecare
AB  - We have developed a prototype home robot to improve drug compliance. The robot is a small mobile device, capable of autonomous behaviour, as well as remotely  controlled operation via a wireless datalink. The robot is capable of face  detection and also has a display screen to provide facial feedback to help  motivate patients and thus increase their level of compliance. An RFID reader can  identify tags attached to different objects, such as bottles, for fluid intake  monitoring. A tablet dispenser allows drug compliance monitoring. Despite some  limitations, experience with the prototype suggests that simple and low-cost  robots may soon become feasible for care of people living alone or in isolation.

T2  - Yearbook of medical informatics
AB  - OBJECTIVES: A "smart home" is a residence wired with technology features that monitor the well-being and activities of their residents to improve overall  quality of life, increase independence and prevent emergencies. This type of  informatics applications targeting older adults, people with disabilities or the  general population is increasingly becoming the focus of research worldwide. The  aim of this study was to provide a comprehensive review of health related smart  home projects and discuss human factors and other challenges. METHODS: To cover  not only the medical but also the social sciences and electronics literature, we  conducted extensive searches across disciplines (e.g., Medline, Embase, CINAHL,  PsycINFO, Electronics and Communications Abstracts, Web of Science etc.). In  order to be inclusive of all new initiatives and efforts in this area given the  innovativeness of the concept, we manually searched for relevant references in  the retrieved articles as well as published books on smart homes and  gerontechnology. RESULTS: A total of 114 publications (including papers,  abstracts and web pages) were identified and reviewed to identify the overarching  projects. Twenty one smart home projects were identified (71% of the projects  include technologies for functional monitoring, 67% for safety monitoring, 47%  for physiological monitoring, 43% for cognitive support or sensory aids, 19% for  monitoring security and 19% to increase social interaction). Evidence for their  impact on clinical outcomes is lacking. CONCLUSIONS: The field of smart homes is  a growing informatics domain. Several challenges including not only technical but  also ethical ones need to be addressed.

T2  - Journal of pain and symptom management
AB  - Many family caregivers are unprepared for the death of their loved one and may suffer from worse mental health as a result. We therefore sought to determine the  factors that family caregivers believe are important to preparing for death and  bereavement. Focus groups and ethnographic interviews were conducted with 33  family caregivers (bereaved or current) of terminally ill patients. The  interviews were audiotaped, transcribed, and analyzed using the constant  comparative method. Life experiences such as the duration of caregiving/illness,  advance care planning, previous experiences with caregiving or death, and medical  sophistication all impacted preparedness, or the degree to which a caregiver is  ready for the death and bereavement. Regardless of life experiences, however, all  caregivers reported medical, practical, psychosocial, and religious/spiritual  uncertainty. Because uncertainty was multidimensional, caregivers often needed  more than prognostic information in order to prepare. Communication was the  primary mechanism used to manage uncertainty. Good communication included clear,  reliable information, combined with relationship-centered care from health care  providers. Finally, preparedness had cognitive, affective, and behavioral  dimensions. To prepare, some caregivers needed information tailored to their  uncertainty (cognitive), others needed to "mentally" or "emotionally" prepare  (affective), and still others had important tasks to complete (behavioral). In  order to better prepare family caregivers for the death of a loved one, health  care providers must develop a trusting relationship with caregivers, provide them  with reliable information tailored to their uncertainty, and allow time for  caregivers to process the information and complete important tasks.

AB  - Industrial countries are faced with a growing elderly population. Homecare systems with assistive smart house technology enable elderly to live  independently at home. Development of such smart home care systems is complex and  expensive and there is no common reference model that can facilitate service  reuse. This paper proposes reusable actor and service models based on a  model-driven development process where end user organizations and domain  healthcare experts from four European countries have been involved. The models,  specified using UML can be reused actively as assets in the system design and  development process and can reduce development costs, and improve  interoperability and sustainability of systems. The models are being evaluated in  the European IST project MPOWER.

AU  - Jakkula, V.

T2  - Methods of information in medicine
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To many people, home is a sanctuary. With the maturing of smart home technologies, many people with cognitive and physical disabilities can lead  independent lives in their own homes for extended periods of time. In this paper,  we investigate the design of machine learning algorithms that support this goal.  We hypothesize that machine learning algorithms can be designed to automatically  learn models of resident behavior in a smart home, and that the results can be  used to perform automated health monitoring and to detect anomalies. METHODS:  Specifically, our algorithms draw upon the temporal nature of sensor data  collected in a smart home to build a model of expected activities and to detect  unexpected, and possibly health-critical, events in the home. RESULTS: We  validate our algorithms using synthetic data and real activity data collected  from volunteers in an automated smart environment. CONCLUSIONS: The results from  our experiments support our hypothesis that a model can be learned from observed  smart home data and used to report anomalies, as they occur, in a smart home.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The authors' aim was to investigate the representations, wishes, and fears of family caregivers (FCs) regarding 14 innovative technologies (IT) for  care aiding and burden alleviation, given the severe physical and psychological  stress induced by dementia care, and the very slow uptake of these technologies  in our society. METHODS: A cluster sample survey based on a self-administered  questionnaire was carried out on data collected from 270 families of patients  with Alzheimer's disease or related disorders, located in the greater Paris area.  Multiple Correspondence Analysis was used in addition to usual statistical tests  to identify homogenous FCs clusters concerning the appreciation or rejection of  the considered technologies. RESULTS: Two opposite clusters were clearly defined:  FCs in favor of a substantial use of technology, and those rather or totally  hostile. Furthermore the distributions of almost all the answers of appreciations  were U-shaped. Significant relations were demonstrated between IT appreciation  and FC's family or gender statuses (e.g., female FCs appreciated a tracking  device for quick recovering of wandering patients more than male FCs: p = 0.0025,  N = 195). CONCLUSIONS: The study provides further evidence of the contrasted  perception of technology in dementia care at home, and suggests the development  of public debates based on rigorous assessment of practices and a strict ethical  aim to protect against misuse.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To understand whether home health technology in the market and in development can satisfy the needs of patients and their non-professional  caregivers for proactive support in managing health and chronic conditions in the  home. METHODS: A panel of clinical providers and technology researchers was  assembled to examine whether home health technology addresses consumer-defined  requirements for self-care devices. A lexicon of home care and self-care  technology terms was then created. A global survey of home health technology for  patients with heart disease and dementia was conducted. The 254 items identified  were categorized by conditions treated, primary user, function, and purpose. A  focus group of patients and caregivers was convened to describe their  expectations of self-care technology. Items identified in the database were then  assessed for these attributes. RESULTS: Patients and family caregivers indicated  a need for intelligent self-care technology which supports early diagnosis of  health changes, intervention enablement, and improvement of communication quality  among patients and the health care system. Of these, only intervention enablement  was commonly found in the home health technology items identified. CONCLUSIONS:  An opportunity exists to meet consumer self-care needs through increased research  and development in intelligent self-care technology.

T2  - BMC medical informatics and decision making
AB  - BACKGROUND: Targeting older clients for rehabilitation is a clinical challenge and a research priority. We investigate the potential of machine learning  algorithms - Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) - to  guide rehabilitation planning for home care clients. METHODS: This study is a  secondary analysis of data on 24,724 longer-term clients from eight home care  programs in Ontario. Data were collected with the RAI-HC assessment system, in  which the Activities of Daily Living Clinical Assessment Protocol (ADLCAP) is  used to identify clients with rehabilitation potential. For study purposes, a  client is defined as having rehabilitation potential if there was: i) improvement  in ADL functioning, or ii) discharge home. SVM and KNN results are compared with  those obtained using the ADLCAP. For comparison, the machine learning algorithms  use the same functional and health status indicators as the ADLCAP. RESULTS: The  KNN and SVM algorithms achieved similar substantially improved performance over  the ADLCAP, although false positive and false negative rates were still fairly  high (FP > .18, FN > .34 versus FP > .29, FN. > .58 for ADLCAP). Results are used  to suggest potential revisions to the ADLCAP. CONCLUSION: Machine learning  algorithms achieved superior predictions than the current protocol. Machine  learning results are less readily interpretable, but can also be used to guide  development of improved clinical protocols.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: There may be great potential for using computer-modeling techniques and machine-learning algorithms in clinical decision making, if these can be  shown to produce results superior to clinical protocols currently in use. We aim  to explore the potential to use an automatic, data-driven, machine-learning  algorithm in clinical decision making. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Using a database  containing comprehensive health assessment information (the interRAI-HC) on home  care clients (N=24,724) from eight community-care regions in Ontario, Canada, we  compare the performance of the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm and a Clinical  Assessment Protocol (the "ADLCAP") currently used to predict rehabilitation  potential. For our purposes, we define a patient as having rehabilitation  potential if the patient had functional improvement or remained at home over a  follow-up period of approximately 1 year. RESULTS: The KNN algorithm has a lower  false positive rate in all but one of the eight regions in the sample, and lower  false negative rates in all regions. Compared using likelihood ratio statistics,  KNN is uniformly more informative than the ADLCAP. CONCLUSION: This article  illustrates the potential for a machine-learning algorithm to enhance clinical  decision making.

AB  - "Telepresence" is an interesting field that includes virtual reality implementations with human-system interfaces, communication technologies, and  robotics. This paper describes the development of a telepresence robot called  Telepresence Robot for Interpersonal Communication (TRIC) for the purpose of  interpersonal communication with the elderly in a home environment. The main aim  behind TRIC's development is to allow elderly populations to remain in their home  environments, while loved ones and caregivers are able to maintain a higher level  of communication and monitoring than via traditional methods. TRIC aims to be a  low-cost, lightweight robot, which can be easily implemented in the home  environment. Under this goal, decisions on the design elements included are  discussed. In particular, the implementation of key autonomous behaviors in TRIC  to increase the user's capability of projection of self and operation of the  telepresence robot, in addition to increasing the interactive capability of the  participant as a dialogist are emphasized. The technical development and  integration of the modules in TRIC, as well as human factors considerations are  then described. Preliminary functional tests show that new users were able to  effectively navigate TRIC and easily locate visual targets. Finally the future  developments of TRIC, especially the possibility of using TRIC for home  tele-health monitoring and tele-homecare visits are discussed.

AB  - We examined the requirements for robots in home telecare using two focus groups. The first comprised six healthcare professionals involved in geriatric care and  the second comprised six elderly people with disabilities living in the  community. The concept of an in-home telepresence robot was illustrated using a  photograph of a mobile robot, and participants were then asked to suggest  potential health care applications. Interview data derived from the transcript of  each group discussion were analyzed using qualitative induction based on content  analysis. The analyses yielded statements that were categorized under three  themes: potential applications, usability issues and user requirements.  Teleoperated mobile robotic systems in the home were thought to be useful in  assisting multidisciplinary patient care through improved communication between  patients and healthcare professionals, and offering respite and support to  caregivers under certain conditions. The shift from a traditional  hospital-centred model of care in geriatrics to a home-based model creates  opportunities for using telepresence with mobile robotic systems in home  telecare.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a need to improve semi-autonomous stroke therapy in home environments often characterized by low supervision of clinical experts and low  extrinsic motivation. Our distributed device approach to this problem consists of  an integrated suite of low-cost robotic/computer-assistive technologies driven by  a novel universal access software framework called UniTherapy. Our design  strategy for personalizing the therapy, providing extrinsic motivation and  outcome assessment is presented and evaluated. METHODS: Three studies were  conducted to evaluate the potential of the suite. A conventional force-reflecting  joystick, a modified joystick therapy platform (TheraJoy), and a steering wheel  platform (TheraDrive) were tested separately with the UniTherapy software. Stroke  subjects with hemiparesis and able-bodied subjects completed tracking activities  with the devices in different positions. We quantify motor performance across  subject groups and across device platforms and muscle activation across devices  at two positions in the arm workspace. RESULTS: Trends in the assessment metrics  were consistent across devices with able-bodied and high functioning strokes  subjects being significantly more accurate and quicker in their motor performance  than low functioning subjects. Muscle activation patterns were different for  shoulder and elbow across different devices and locations. CONCLUSION: The  Robot/CAMR suite has potential for stroke rehabilitation. By manipulating  hardware and software variables, we can create personalized therapy environments  that engage patients, address their therapy need, and track their progress. A  larger longitudinal study is still needed to evaluate these systems in  under-supervised environments such as the home.

T2  - AMIA ... Annual Symposium proceedings. AMIA Symposium
AB  - Spoken medical dialogue is a valuable source of information, and it forms a foundation for diagnosis, prevention and therapeutic management. However,  understanding even a perfect transcript of spoken dialogue is challenging for  humans because of the lack of structure and the verbosity of dialogues. This work  presents a first step towards automatic analysis of spoken medical dialogue. The  backbone of our approach is an abstraction of a dialogue into a sequence of  semantic categories. This abstraction uncovers structure in informal, verbose  conversation between a caregiver and a patient, thereby facilitating automatic  processing of dialogue content. Our method induces this structure based on a  range of linguistic and contextual features that are integrated in a supervised  machine-learning framework. Our model has a classification accuracy of 73%,  compared to 33% achieved by a majority baseline (p<0.01). This work demonstrates  the feasibility of automatically processing spoken medical dialogue.

AB  - In many medical fields the recovery of muscular activity or its improvement up to the level of the optimal parameters is required. Apart from the classical  solution for rehabilitation (physical exercises) the use of electrical  stimulation has become quite frequent of late. The paper presents an interface  that detects the electromyographic (EMG) activity, assesses it, and generates  appropriate electrical stimuli, by means of a specific type of fuzzy control  system, in order to control the dynamics of the EMG. The proposed interface will  detect the motion and muscular activity, it will evaluate and generate the  electrical stimulus using a fuzzy system tuned by dynamic of motion. The  application will transmit e-Health information to the physician via Internet,  synthetic, at request using TCP/IP stack and SMS services for wireless  communication.

T2  - Journal of biomedical informatics
AB  - Spoken medical dialogue is a valuable source of information for patients and caregivers. This work presents a first step towards automatic analysis and  summarization of spoken medical dialogue. We first abstract a dialogue into a  sequence of semantic categories using linguistic and contextual features  integrated in a supervised machine-learning framework. Our model has a  classification accuracy of 73%, compared to 33% achieved by a majority baseline  (p<0.01). We then describe and implement a summarizer that utilizes this  automatically induced structure. Our evaluation results indicate that  automatically generated summaries exhibit high resemblance to summaries written  by humans. In addition, task-based evaluation shows that physicians can  reasonably answer questions related to patient care by looking at the  automatically generated summaries alone, in contrast to the physicians'  performance when they were given summaries from a naïve summarizer (p<0.05). This  work demonstrates the feasibility of automatically structuring and summarizing  spoken medical dialogue.

T2  - IEEE transactions on information technology in biomedicine : a publication of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society
AB  - In this paper, a multiagent system (MAS) is presented, aiming to enhance monitoring, surveillance, and educational services of a generic medical contact  center (MCC) for chronic disease management. In such a home-care scenario, a  persistent need arises for efficiently monitoring the patient contacts and the  MCC's functionality, in order to effectively manage and interpret the large  volume of medical data collected during the patient sessions with the system, and  to assess the use of MCC resources. Software agents were adopted to provide the  means to accomplish such real-time information-processing tasks, due to their  autonomous, reactive and/or proactive nature, and their effectiveness in dynamic  environments by incorporating coordination strategies. Specifically, the  objective of the MAS is to monitor the MCC environment, detect important cases,  and inform the healthcare and administrative personnel via alert messages,  notifications, recommendations, and reports, prompting them for actions. The main  aim of this paper is to present the overall design and implementation of a  proposed MAS, emphasizing its functional model and architecture, as well as on  the agent interactions and the knowledge-sharing mechanism incorporated, in the  context of a generic MCC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Treating multiple health behavior risks on a population basis is one of the most promising approaches to enhancing health and reducing health care  costs. Previous research demonstrated the efficacy of expert system interventions  for three behaviors in a population of parents. The interventions provide  individualized feedback that guides participants through the stages of change for  each of their risk behaviors. This study extended that research to a more  representative population of patients from primary care practice and to targeting  of four rather than three behaviors. METHODS: Stage-based expert systems were  applied to reduce smoking, improve diet, decrease sun exposure, and prevent  relapse from regular mammography. A randomized clinical controlled trial  recruited 69.2% of primary care patients (N = 5407) at home via telephone. Three  intervention contacts were delivered for each risk factor at 0, 6, and 12 months.  The primary outcome measures were the percentages of at-risk patients at baseline  who progressed to the action or maintenance stages at 24-month follow-up for each  of the risk behaviors. RESULTS: Significant treatment effects were found for each  of the four behaviors, with 25.4% of intervention patients in action or  maintenance for smoking, 28.8% for diet, and 23.4% for sun exposure. The  treatment group had less relapse from regular mammography than the control group  (6% vs. 10%). CONCLUSION: Proactive, home-based, and stage-matched expert systems  can produce relatively high population impacts on multiple behavior risks for  cancer and other chronic diseases.

T2  - Studies in health technology and informatics
AB  - The Body Area Network (BAN) extends the range of existing wireless network technologies by an ultra-low range, ultra-low power network solution optimised  for long-term or continuous healthcare applications. It enables wireless radio  communication between several miniaturised, intelligent Body Sensor (or actor)  Units (BSU) and a single Body Central Unit (BCU) worn at the human body. A  separate wireless transmission link from the BCU to a network access point--using  different technology--provides for online access to BAN components via usual  network infrastructure. The BAN network protocol maintains dynamic ad-hoc network  configuration scenarios and co-existence of multiple networks.BAN is expected to  become a basic infrastructure element for electronic health services: By  integrating patient-attached sensors and mobile actor units, distributed  information and data processing systems, the range of medical workflow can be  extended to include applications like wireless multi-parameter patient monitoring  and therapy support. Beyond clinical use and professional disease management  environments, private personal health assistance scenarios (without financial  reimbursement by health agencies / insurance companies) enable a wide range of  applications and services in future pervasive computing and networking  environments.

TI  - The medical appointment scheduler.
AU  - Lacson, Ronilda
T2  - Studies in health technology and informatics
AB  - In order to enhance our understanding of how to best improve patient care, it was necessary to initially identify key questions that patients ask most frequently  by recording actual calls made by home hemodialysis patients to a dialysis clinic  over a three-month period. From an initial analysis of the recorded  conversations, one of the most frequent reasons for patient calls was for  scheduling concerns. Since the use of automated systems often enable a quicker  response to patients' needs and alleviate time demands on the personnel that have  to answer these calls, an automated scheduling system was designed and  implemented to address this concern. The SCHEDULER is a mixed-initiative spoken  dialogue system that allows a patient to schedule an appointment with a provider  over the telephone. The system was implemented using SPEECHBUILDER, a utility  developed by the Spoken Language System group at M.I.T. that helps automatically  configure human language technology servers to create a new conversational  system. We describe the system architecture, general considerations in the  design, and a preliminary evaluation of the system.

AU  - Koch, S.
T2  - Advances in dental research
AB  - Despite promising results in medical informatics research and the development of a large number of different systems, few systems get beyond a prototype state and  are really used in practice. Among other factors, the lack of explicit user focus  is one main reason. The research projects presented in this paper follow a  user-centered system development approach based on extensive work analyses in  interdisciplinary working groups, taking into account human cognitive  performance. Different medical and health-care specialists, together with  researchers in human-computer interaction and medical informatics, specify future  clinical work scenarios. Special focus is put on analysis and design of the  information and communication flow and on exploration of intuitive visualization  and interaction techniques for clinical information. Adequate choice of the  technical access device is made depending on the user's work situation. It is the  purpose of this paper to apply this method in two different research projects and  thereby to show its potential for designing clinically useful systems that do  support and not hamper clinical work. These research projects cover IT support  for chairside work in dentistry  (http://www.dis.uu.se/mdi/research/projects/orquest) and ICT support for home  health care of elderly citizens (http://www.medsci.uu.se/mie/project/closecare).

HIS2 is an experimental platform for the  evaluation and the development of technologies in order to ensure the security  and quality of life for patients who need home based medical monitoring. Location  sensors are placed in each room of the HIS2, allowing the monitoring of patient's  successive activity phases within the patient's home environment. We proceeded  with a sampling in an hourly schedule to detect weak rhythmic variations. Based  on numerous measurements, we established a mean value with confidence limits.  These also allowed us to define a zone within which the patient's activity is  qualified to be "predictable." Alerts are set off if the patient's activity  deviates from this zone.

AU  - Abidi, S. S.
T2  - Studies in health technology and informatics
AB  - The 21st century promises to usher in an era of Internet based healthcare services--Tele-Healthcare. Such services augur well with the on-going paradigm  shift in healthcare delivery patterns, i.e. patient centred services as opposed  to provider centred services and wellness maintenance as opposed to illness  management. This paper presents a Tele-Healthcare info-structure TIDE--an  'intelligent' wellness-oriented healthcare delivery environment. TIDE  incorporates two WWW-based healthcare systems: (1) AIMS (Automated Health  Monitoring System) for wellness maintenance and (2) IDEAS (Illness Diagnostic &  Advisory System) for illness management. Our proposal comes from an attempt to  rethink the sources of possible leverage in improving healthcare; vis-à-vis the  provision of a continuum of personalised home-based healthcare services that  emphasise the role of the individual in self health maintenance.

AB  - Knowledge-based monitoring and therapy planning systems were mainly built for the convenience of health care providers. They neglected the consumers of health  care, namely, the patients. Our approach is concentrated on the individual  patients' demands and needs. We are designing, building, and demonstrating a  cooperative agent to support patients' management of their own health-related  behavior on a day-to-day basis at home. Clinical treatment protocols are  represented in an intention-based time-oriented representation language to  overcome the drawbacks of vague or ill-structured problem definitions (e.g.,  missing functional dependencies). These representations are used to guide the  patients, to provide necessary explanations, and to observe and critique whether  the patients obey the instructions of the health-care providers. We will present  a prototype which supports women with gestational diabetes mellitus.

AB  - The use of health diaries to monitor patients with chronic diseases has often been complicated by difficulties encountered in data quality assurance and  interpretation. An expert system, Monitor, has been developed to predict the  health status of cystic fibrosis patients based on daily home measurements of  pulse, respiratory rate, weight, inspired vital capacity, and a check list of  symptoms of acute illness. This system ensures data reliability beyond what can  be achieved in most current automatic error detection procedures by validating  inputs against patient-specific expectations. Its explicit representation of the  time dimension and the hierarchical structure of its knowledge base facilitate  the abstraction of trends and relationships among the time-dependent data.  Dynamically imposed expectations also lend flexibility to the interpretation  process by allowing the processing of partial (incomplete) data. Monitor  correctly classified 86 percent (three-category classification) and 94 percent  (two-category classification) of 111 cases. This demonstrates that expert systems  can be a feasible approach in building more robust diary monitoring systems.

AB  - Informal caregivers often complain about missing knowledge. A knowledge-based personalized educational system is developed, which provides caregiving relatives  with the information needed. Yet, evaluation against domain experts indicated,  that parts of the knowledge-base are incorrect. To overcome these problems the  system can be extended by a learning capacity and then be trained further  utilizing feedback from real informal caregivers. To extend the existing system  an artificial neural network was trained to represent a large part of the  knowledge-based approach. This paper describes the found artificial neural  network's structure and the training process. The found neural network structure  is not deep but very wide. The training terminated after 374.700 epochs with a  mean squared error of 7.731 ∗ 10-8 for the end validation set. The neural network  represents the parts of the knowledge-based approach and can now be retrained  with user feedback, which will be collected during a system test in April and May  2019.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Speech and language cues are considered significant data sources that can reveal insights into one's behavior and well-being. The goal of this study is  to evaluate how different machine learning (ML) classifiers trained both on the  spoken word and acoustic features during live conversations between family  caregivers and a therapist, correlate to anxiety and quality of life (QoL) as  assessed by validated instruments. METHODS: The dataset comprised of 124  audio-recorded and professionally transcribed discussions between family  caregivers of hospice patients and a therapist, of challenges they faced in their  caregiving role, and standardized assessments of self-reported QoL and anxiety.  We custom-built and trained an Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) system on older  adult voices and created a logistic regression-based classifier that incorporated  audio-based features. The classification process automated the QoL scoring and  display of the score in real time, replacing hand-coding for self-reported  assessments with a machine learning identified classifier. FINDINGS: Of the 124  audio files and their transcripts, 87 of these transcripts (70%) were selected to  serve as the training set, holding the remaining 30% of the data for evaluation.  For anxiety, the results of adding the dimension of sound and an automated  speech-to-text transcription outperformed the prior classifier trained only on  human-rendered transcriptions. Specifically, precision improved from 86% to 92%,  accuracy from 81% to 89%, and recall from 78% to 88%. INTERPRETATION: Classifiers  can be developed through ML techniques which can indicate improvements in QoL  measures with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Examining the content, sound of  the voice and context of the conversation provides insights into additional  factors affecting anxiety and QoL that could be addressed in tailored therapy and  the design of conversational agents serving as therapy chatbots.

AB  - Due to the demographic aging of society, the demand for skilled caregiving is increasing. However, the already existing shortage of professional caregivers  will exacerbate in the future. As a result, family caregivers must shoulder a  heavier share of the care burden. To ease the burden and promote a better  work-life balance, we developed the Digital Case Manager. This tool uses machine  learning algorithms to learn the relationship between a care situation and the  next care steps and helps family caregivers balance their professional and  private lives so that they are able to continue caring for their family members  without sacrificing their own jobs and personal ambitions. The data for the  machine learning model are generated by means of a questionnaire based on  professional assessment instruments. We implemented a proof-of-concept of the  Digital Case Manager and initial tests show promising results. It offers a quick  and easy-to-use tool for family caregivers in the early stages of a care  situation.
