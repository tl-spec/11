AB  - AIMS: To assess patients' and nurses' perceptions and experiences of subepidermal moisture scanning acceptability. DESIGN: Descriptive, qualitative, sub-study,  embedded within a pilot randomized control trial. METHODS: Ten patients who were  in the intervention arm of the pilot trial and 10 registered nurses providing  care for these patients on medical-surgical units participated in individual  semi-structured interviews. Data were collected from October 2021 to January  2022. Interviews were analysed using inductive qualitative content analysis, and  perspectives (patient and nurse), were triangulated. RESULTS: Four categories  were found. The first category 'Subepidermal moisture scanning is acceptable as  part of care' showed that patients and nurses were willing to use subepidermal  moisture scanning and viewed subepidermal moisture scanning as non-burdensome.  The category 'Subepidermal moisture scanning may improve pressure injury  outcomes' demonstrated that although subepidermal moisture scanning was believed  to prevent pressure injuries, more research evidence about its benefits was  required. 'Subepidermal moisture scanning augments existing pressure injury  prevention practices', the third category, highlighted that subepidermal moisture  scanning aligns with current pressure injury prevention practices while making  these practices more patient-centred. In the final category, 'Important  considerations when making subepidermal moisture scanning routine practice',  practical issues were raised relating to training, guidelines, infection control,  device availability and patient modesty. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that  using subepidermal moisture scanning is acceptable for patients and nurses.  Building the evidence base for subepidermal moisture scanning and then addressing  practical issues prior to implementation, are important next steps. Our research  suggests that subepidermal moisture scanning enhances individualized and  patient-centred care, persuasive reasons to continue investigating subepidermal  moisture scanning. IMPACT: For an intervention to be successfully implemented it  must be both effective and acceptable, however, there is limited evidence of  patients' and nurses' views of SEMS acceptability. SEM scanners are acceptable to  use in practice for patients and nurses. There are many procedural aspects that  need to be considered when using SEMS such as frequency of measurements. This  research may have benefit for patients, as SEMS may promote a more individualized  and patient-centred approach to pressure injury prevention. Further, these  findings can assist researchers, providing justification to proceed with  effectiveness research. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: A consumer advisor was  involved in study design, interpretation of data and preparation of manuscript.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Subepidermal moisture (SEM) changes may detect early tissue injury and enhance pressure injury risk assessments. However, little is known how  modifiable factors, like head of bed elevation (HOBE), affect SEM. AIM: This  study investigated the influence of HOBE on sacral and heel SEM, using the  Provizio ® SEM Scanner. METHOD: A 2 × 2 randomised crossover study compared the  effects of 30-min of 30⁰ versus 60⁰ HOBE on sacral and heel SEM in healthy  adults. RESULTS: 48 participants were randomly allocated to 30⁰ or 60⁰ HOBE and  crossed over after a 60-min washout period. The mean age was 40.6 years  (SD = 18.3). The study found the sacral and heel SEM values were not  statistically different at 30⁰ versus 60⁰ HOBE. No clinically relevant  association between SEM and characteristics of age, sex, body mass index and skin  type were found. Baseline sacral and heel SEM values recovered after a 60-min  washout period. Notably, half of the initial baseline measures suggested pressure  injury risk. CONCLUSION: The HOBE may not influence SEM at the sacrum and heels,  in healthy adults after 30 min of loading. Standard operating procedures for  measuring SEM for pressure injury risk assessment require a stronger body of  evidence in varied populations and timeframes before this technology is widely  adopted.

T2  - Journal of clinical nursing
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To map current literature on bedside clinicians' use of point-of-care subepidermal moisture devices to identify increased pressure injury  risk. BACKGROUND: Pressure injuries are a substantial healthcare burden.  Localised oedema occurs before visible or palpable changes, and therefore is a  biomarker of increased pressure injury risk. Novel bedside technologies that  detect localised oedema may aid early pressure injury preventative practices.  DESIGN: A scoping review. METHODS: Arksey and O'Malley's six-step framework and  the PRISMA-ScR guidelines guided this scoping review. CINAHL Complete, Embase,  SCOPUS, Cochrane (wounds) and PubMed databases were searched for primary research  and quality improvement projects published in English between 2008-2022. Included  studies focused on clinicians' bedside use of subepidermal moisture devices to  quantify localised oedema and pressure injury risk. The PAGER framework supported  narrative synthesis of the extracted data. RESULTS: Nine studies were selected  from 1676 sources. Two point-of-care subepidermal moisture devices were  identified in clinical use, largely by nurses. Inconsistent use and  interpretations revealed significant knowledge gaps in clinical practice.  Additionally, no included studies engaged patients or the public in their design.  CONCLUSIONS: Nurses recognise the value of objective measures in determining the  risk of pressure injury and are the primary end-users of point-of-care  subepidermal moisture devices. However, standardising procedural instructions and  interpretive criteria to guide preventative measures requires further research.  RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: International pressure injury clinical practice  guidelines advocate for subepidermal moisture devices as an adjunct to routine  clinical skin assessment, although little is known about bedside use. This  scoping review reveals low adoption of such devices and the need to develop  standardised procedures in their use and interpretation.

TI  - Feasibility of Skin Water Content Imaging Using CMOS Sensors.
AU  - Saiko, Gennadi
T2  - Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)
AB  - Pressure injuries (PI) result from pressure-induced damage to the skin and underlying tissues. Currently, Stage I PI are detected using visual skin  assessments. However, this visual method is unable to detect skin color changes  in persons with darkly pigmented skin, which results in a higher Stage II-IV PI  incidence and PI-associated mortality in persons with a darker complexion. Thus,  a more objective method of early-stage PI detection is of great importance.  Optical spectroscopy is a promising modality for the noncontact diagnosis and  monitoring of skin water content, capable of detecting edema and Stage I PI. The  scope of the current study is to assess the feasibility of imaging the water  content of the skin using Si-based sensors. We have considered two primary cases:  the elevated bulk water content (edema) and localized water pool (e.g., blood  vessels). These two cases were analyzed using analytical models. We found that  detecting the watercontent contrast associated with edema in tissues is within  the reach of Si-based sensors. However, although the effect is expected to be  detectable even with consumer-grade cameras, with the current state of  technologies, their use in real-world conditions faces numerous technical  challenges, mainly due to the narrow dynamic range.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the impact of sub epidermal moisture (SEM) measurement and targeted pressure ulcer (PU) prevention, versus visual skin  assessment and usual care, on mean SEM delta scores and early pressure ulcer  development in acute hospital patients. A quantitative quasi-experimental  observational approach was used. A total of 149 at risk acute hospital patients  took part, 78 treatment, and 71 control. SEM deltas were recorded daily for a  maximum of 5 days using the SEM Scanner (Bruin Biometrics LLC, Los Angeles,  California), on three sites: the sacrum, the right heel, and the left heel, with  enhanced and targeted PU prevention interventions occurring in those with an  elevated SEM delta scores in the treatment group. Intention to treat analysis was  used to guide the final composition of results. SEM PU represents PU development  as identified by 2 days of sustained abnormal SEM delta scores, ≥0.5, after day  one. The mean number of days completed by participants was just under 4 days,  participants had many different comorbidities, with the most common being:  hypertension, cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Results showed  that following the introduction of SEM guided targeted treatments, participants  in the treatment group yielded a statistically significant reduction in mean SEM  delta scores (MD: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.59, 0.39; P < .0001), and in the odds of  developing a SEM PU (OR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.24 to 1.00; P = .05). In the treatment  group, none of the participants developed a visual PU, whereas, in the control  group, 1.41% (n = 1/71) developed a visual PU. Based on all the results, the  following is concluded, (1). There was a greater reduction in mean SEM delta  scores among those cared for using SEM measurement and targeted PU prevention,  versus those cared for using visual skin assessment and usual care, and (2). the  mean SEM delta scores was statistically significantly lower at the study end for  those who received targeted treatments based on abnormal SEM scores. More  research is now needed in other and larger at-risk groups to further validate  what was found in this study.

AB  - Nurses, as the largest forces in the health system, are always challenged with various work responsibilities such as long working hours, lack of manpower and  death of patients. This study aimed at providing a model of the relationship  between workload and physical and mental health, sleep disorders, and individual  and family problems by the mediation role of job stress. The present study is a  cross-sectional study that was conducted on 300 nurses in a specialty and  sub-specialty hospital in Tehran. For this reason, various questionnaires  including demographic, survey of shift workers (SOS) and job stress  questionnaires were used to collect the desired data. The proposed model was  presented using structural equation modeling method based on Smart-PLS and  SPSS-20 software. The results show that workload has an effect on job stress  (β=0.747), mental health (β=-0.291), Physical health (β=-0.253), sleep quality  (β=-0.234) and personal and family problems (β=-0.206). Also the results of this  study show that job stress has an effect on mental health (β=-0.295), Physical  health (β=-0.349), sleep quality (β=-0.295) and Personal and family problems  (β=-0.441). In conclusion, results showed that the data fitted well with the  model and that workload is associated with physical and mental problems, sleep  disorders and individual and family problems both directly and indirectly through  job stress mediation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Subepidermal moisture (SEM) scanning is a novel technology that measures changes in localised oedema. Accumulation of subepidermal oedema is  associated with early tissue damage that may lead to a pressure injury. AIM: The  primary study objective was to observe the variations in sacral subepidermal  oedema levels over a continuous period of 60-degree head of bed elevation  positioning. METHODS: Healthy adult participants were recruited in this  prospective observational study. Participants were positioned at 60-degree head  of bed elevation for 120 min and sacral SEM measurements were collected at  baseline and in 20 min increments. RESULTS: A total of 20 participants with a  mean age of 39.3 years (SD = 14.7) were recruited. The mean SEM delta value  increased 6.3% from 0.46 SEM delta at baseline to 0.49 SEM delta after 120 min,  however these differences are not statistically significant (p = .21). There were  also no significant findings between SEM delta variations and demographic  factors. CONCLUSION: In a sample of healthy individuals, 120 min of continuous  loading with a 60-degree head of bed elevation did not lead to a significant  change in sacral subepidermal oedema levels. Further research on the response of  healthy adult tissue under external forces associated with different angles of  head of bed positioning may further contribute to our understanding pressure  injury prevention.

AB  - Pressure ulcer (PU) prevention in the intensive care unit (ICU) is an important clinical issue as critically unwell patients are at high risk of developing PUs.  However, current methods of PU detection are limited, especially for early  detection. This study aimed to establish the correlation between Interleukin-1α  (IL-1α)/total protein (TP) and sub-epidermal moisture (SEM) measurements in the  early identification of PUs in ICU patients. This study employed an observational  research design using the STROBE guidelines. Following ethical approval, 53  participants were recruited and sebum was obtained using Sebutape from  weight-bearing areas (sacrum, heels and a control site). SEM measurements were  taken from the same anatomical sites. Both measures were taken at the same time  and participants were followed up for 5 days, or until discharge or death.  Correlations between SEM delta measurements, IL-1α, TP and PU incidence and other  demographic information were explored using Spearman's correlation for data not  normally distributed, and Pearson's R correlation coefficient for normally  distributed data. Mean baseline SEM delta measurements indicate abnormal readings  for all anatomical sites except the control site, consistent with previous  studies. Mean baseline IL-1α/TP readings were higher for the sacrum versus both  heels and, on average, readings were higher for the control site versus all other  anatomical locations. This is conflicting, given that the control site was  non-weight bearing. There were very weak or weak correlations between SEM delta  measurements and IL-1α/TP readings. SEM measurements are quick and easy to obtain  and results are instant, however Sebutape sampling takes significantly longer and  is challenging to conduct among haemodynamically unstable patients. Obtaining SEM  measurements is more practical and feasible than Sebutape sampling to assess for  the presence of inflammation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim was to assess evidence related to the measuring of subepidermal moisture (SEM) to detect early, nonvisible development of pressure  ulcers (PUs). METHOD: Using systematic review methodology, all quantitative  animal and human research studies written in English were considered. In January  2021, PubMed, CINAHL, SCOPUS, Cochrane and EMBASE databases were searched. The  primary outcome of interest was the validity of SEM measurement to detect early  PU development. The secondary outcome was time to PU detection, sensitivity and  specificity of SEM measurement, and the impact of SEM measurements on PU  prevention. Data analysis was undertaken using RevMan and narrative synthesis.  RESULTS: A total of 17 articles met the inclusion criteria. In all studies, a  consistent abnormal deviation in SEM measurements corresponded with evidence of  visual PU development. Time to PU development, explored in four studies, showed  earlier detection of PU development using SEM measurement. RevMan analysis  identified the mean difference in time to PU development (SEM measurement versus  visual skin assessment, VSA) was 4.61 days (95% confidence interval: 3.94-5.28;  p=0.0001) in favour of SEM measurements. The sensitivity of SEM measurements was  reported in four studies, and scores varied from 48.3% to 100.0%. Specificity was  also reported in four studies and scores ranged from 24.4% to 83.0%. The impact  of the detection of abnormal SEM measurements on PU prevention was explored by  one study. Results showed a 93% decrease in PU rates when staff acted on the  results of the SEM readings. CONCLUSION: The findings of this review identified  that SEM measurement detects PU development earlier than VSA. Furthermore, when  staff responded to abnormal SEM measurements, prevention strategies were  enhanced, with a subsequent reduction in visible PU development. SEM measurement  may therefore be a useful addition to PU prevention strategies. DECLARATION OF  INTEREST: The School of Nursing & Midwifery, RCSI has a research agreement with  Bruin Biometrics. Funding for the study was through an Irish Research Council PhD  Enterprise Partnership Scheme with Bruin Biometrics. The authors have no other  conflicts of interest.

AB  - AIM: Sub-epidermal moisture scanning (SEMS) is a novel point-of-care technology that measures localised oedema and detects early tissue damage that may develop  into a pressure injury (PI). It provides objective data that may assist PI  prevention (PIP) decision making. This study aimed to determine the feasibility  of undertaking a definitive randomised controlled trial (RCT) to test the  effectiveness of SEMS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This pilot RCT recruited medical  and surgical patients at risk of developing a PI in one Australian hospital. All  participants received routine PIP care and daily visual skin assessment to  determine the presence of a PI. The intervention group also received daily SEMS.  Clinical staff were told if the sub-epidermal moisture (SEM) value was abnormal  but were not given advice for PIP. Blinding of patients, care staff and outcome  assessors was not practical. Feasibility outcomes included recruitment,  retention, intervention fidelity, and patient outcomes. RESULTS: Of 1185 patients  screened prior to eligibility, 950 were excluded (80%); 235 were then assessed  for eligibility and 160 met the inclusion criteria (68.1%); 100 were recruited  (70.0%) and randomised and 99 completed the trial (intervention n = 50; control  n = 49) with one person withdrawn due to inappropriate recruitment (100%  retention). Of the 657 expected SEMS observations, 598 were completed (91%  intervention fidelity). Only 34 of 454 (7.4%) patient outcome data points were  missing. CONCLUSIONS: Most feasibility criteria were met, indicating a definitive  trial to assess the effectiveness of SEMS in a medical-surgical patient  population is realistic. However, recruitment may be resource intensive and  require specific strategies.

T2  - Journal of wound care
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study assesses anonymous patient-level data on the use of sub-epidermal moisture (SEM) assessment technology as a tool in the prevention of  pressure ulceration in at-risk hospital patients. METHOD: The relationship  between technology-generated prompts for clinical action (patient turning,  application of pressure redistributing equipment, heel protection or cream) and  consequent clinical action was evaluated using data cross-tabulations (using data  aggregated over multiple anatomical sites); in a multilevel model with patients  clustered within wards, clustered in turn within hospitals, and controlling for  additional patient- and institution-level factors; and using receiver operating  characteristic (ROC) analyses of anatomy-specific data. The ability of the SEM  assessment technology to detect deep and early-stage pressure ulcers/injuries on  specific anatomical areas of a patient's body on admission, earlier than visual  and tactile skin tissue assessments (STA), was assessed. RESULTS: A total of  15,574 patient assessments ('cases') were reported on 1995 patients. Most  incidences of nurse action were in response to a prompt from SEM assessments  (4944/5494; 90.0%). An SEM delta (Δ)≥0.6 resulted in nurse action in 4944/13,071  cases (37.8%). The multilevel model revealed strong evidence that SEM Δ prompts  were significantly associated with nurse action (p<0.001; adjusted odds ratio:  1.99). CONCLUSION: In this study, SEM assessment technology effectively prompted  nurse action moreso than skin reddening diagnosed via trained clinician judgement  and STAs. While baseline responses of nurses' actions remained low, with or  without SEM Δ prompts, findings verified the 'clinical utility' of SEM assessment  technology as an objective prompt for early clinical action over and above  existing mechanisms.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Oedema measurement, also termed sub-epidermal moisture measurement is recommended as an adjunct pressure injury prevention intervention in  international guidelines because it indicates early tissue damage. OBJECTIVE: To  determine the prognostic value of oedema measurement in predicting future  pressure injury in adults in any care setting. DESIGN: Systematic review and  meta-analysis. SETTING: Participants were recruited from nursing homes or aged  care facilities, hospitals, or post-acute facilities. PARTICIPANTS: Adults.  METHODS: A modified 2-week systematic review was undertaken. Study designs  included cohort (prospective and retrospective), case-control, case series if  relevant comparisons were reported, randomised controlled trials if the  association between oedema measurement and pressure injury was reported, and  registry data. Databases searched included: Medical Literature Analysis and  Retrieval System Online, The Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health  Literature, Excerpta Medica and the Cochrane Library from inception to 13 July  2021 with no language restrictions. Screening, data extraction using Checklist  for Critical Appraisal and Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews of Prediction  Modelling Studies - Prognostic Factors (CHARMS-PF) and quality assessment using  Quality in Prognostic Factor Studies (QUIPS) were undertaken independently by ≥2  authors and adjudicated by another if required. Meta-analyses and meta-regression  were undertaken. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the Grading of  Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. RESULTS:  Six studies (n = 483 total) were included. Two studies were set in nursing homes  and four in either hospitals or post-acute facilities. Fives studies were  prospective cohorts, and one was a randomised control trial. Two studies were  assessed as low risk and four studies as moderate risk of bias. The pooled risk  ratio in four studies (n = 388) for the relationship between oedema and pressure  injury cumulative incidence was 18.87 (95% CI 2.13-38.29) and for time to  pressure injury was 4.08 days (95% CI 1.64-6.52). Using GRADE, the certainty of  the body of evidence was low for all outcomes. Meta-regression indicated that  age, gender, and sample size were poor predictors for the association between  oedema and pressure injury. CONCLUSIONS: Measuring oedema as a predictor for  pressure injury development is showing promise but a stronger body of evidence  that takes into consideration other prognostic factors is needed to better  understand its benefit. REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42021267834. TWEETABLE  ABSTRACT: Measuring oedema is a promising strategy to prevent pressure injuries  but the certainty of evidence for this claim is low.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of sub-epidermal moisture (SEM) assessment technology as an adjunct to visual assessment to reduce pressure ulcer (PU)  incidence alongside standard PU care pathways. METHOD: Data were obtained from  wards located within 28 institutions in the UK, Canada, Belgium, Spain and  Ireland. At each ward, the proportion of patients scanned who were observed to  have one or more PUs of Category 2 or above during a pre-Pressure Ulcer Reduction  Programme (PURP) implementation period starting between November 2017 and July  2018 was recorded. The proportion of patients scanned who were observed to have  one or more PUs of Category 2 or above during a post-PURP implementation period  starting between November 2018 and July 2019 was also recorded. A meta-analysis  was conducted on the data using wards as the unit of analysis, to facilitate  overall estimate of the PURP. A sensitivity study was also conducted to assess  the sensitivity of results to data from specific institutions. RESULTS: A  synthesised estimate of the overall relative risk (RR) was calculated to be 0.38  (95% confidence interval 0.26 to 0.56). Hence the risk of PU in the post-PURP  cohort was about one-third that of the corresponding risk in the pre-PURP cohort.  The sensitivity analysis revealed no evidence that any individual ward exerted  excessive influence on the findings. CONCLUSION: The analysis has revealed strong  evidence that implementation of the PURP was associated with reduction in  incidence of Category 2 or above PUs across a wide range of clinical settings.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the predictive ability of subepidermal moisture (SEM) measurement versus traditional risk assessment and visual skin assessment (VSA)  as means of detecting early pressure ulcer (PU) damage development among adults  undergoing surgery. METHOD: A non-experimental, comparative, descriptive cohort  study design was used. Following ethical approval, participants who had given  their informed written consent had their skin assessed over the areas that were  weight-bearing during surgery, using VSA and the SEM measurement. Visual PUs were  graded according to the European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel and National  Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel ulcer grading system. Assessments took place  preoperatively, then daily on the ward, beginning on day one postoperatively and  continuing for three days or until discharge. RESULTS: Of the 231 participants,  who had a mean age of 57.50 years, 55.8% (n=129) were male. The most common  comorbidity was cardiology/vascular (n=42; 18.2%). Just over half (52.4%; n=121)  underwent orthopaedic surgery and 47.6% (n=110) underwent non-orthopaedic  surgery; 70% (n=163) received a general anaesthetic and 43% (n=100) were in the  supine decubitus position during surgery. PU incidence was 51% (n=116), according  to SEM measurement, and 3% (n=7) according to VSA. Among the seven participants  who developed a visual PU, 10 PUs at stage 1 developed (31%); some patients  developed more than one PU. Of the participants who had assessments for three  days postoperatively, 94% (n=61) had a persistently high SEM delta on day three.  The variables that emerged as statistically significantly related to abnormal SEM  measurement deltas among these participants were: surgery duration (p=0.038);  having orthopaedic surgery (p=0.020); supine surgical position (p=0.003); spinal  anaesthetic type (p=0.0001); and Waterlow and Braden mobility subscale day one  postoperatively (p=0.0001). None of the variables had a statistically significant  influence on abnormal VSA. CONCLUSION: Surgical patients, because of immobility,  are vulnerable to the action of compression and shear forces. These forces cause  changes at a cellular level that trigger inflammation, which is a precursor to  early tissue damage. SEM measurement can detect this tissue damage from the  increase in the underlying tissue water content that results from inflammation.  From the findings of this study, SEM measurement is very promising in the  detection of early tissue damage in those at risk of PU development among the  surgical population.

AB  - Coronavirus disease is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The virus first appeared in Wuhan (China) in December 2019 and has spread globally. Till now, it affected  269 million people with 5.3 million deaths in 224 countries and territories. With  the emergence of variants like Omicron, the COVID-19 cases grew exponentially,  with thousands of deaths. The general symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, sore  throat, cough, lung infections, and, in severe cases, acute respiratory distress  syndrome, sepsis, and death. SARS-CoV-2 predominantly affects the lung, but it  can also affect other organs such as the brain, heart, and gastrointestinal  system. It is observed that 75 % of hospitalized COVID-19 patients have at least  one COVID-19 associated comorbidity. The most common reported comorbidities are  hypertension, NDs, diabetes, cancer, endothelial dysfunction, and CVDs. Moreover,  older and pre-existing polypharmacy patients have worsened COVID-19 associated  complications. SARS-CoV-2 also results in the hypercoagulability issues like  gangrene, stroke, pulmonary embolism, and other associated complications. This  review aims to provide the latest information on the impact of the COVID-19 on  pre-existing comorbidities such as CVDs, NDs, COPD, and other complications. This  review will help us to understand the current scenario of COVID-19 and  comorbidities; thus, it will play an important role in the management and  decision-making efforts to tackle such complications.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Non-compressible intra-abdominal hemorrhage (NCIAH) is a major cause of preventable death on the battlefield and in civilian trauma. Currently,  it can only be definitively managed with surgery, as there are limited strategies  for controlling ongoing NCIAH in the prehospital environment. We hypothesized  that a self-propelling thrombin-containing powder (SPTP) could increase survival  in a swine model of NCIAH when delivered percutaneously into the closed abdomen  using an engineered spray system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nineteen swine underwent  surgical laparotomy followed by a Grade V liver injury that created massive  hemorrhage, before closing the abdomen with sutures. Animals either received  treatment with standard of care fluid resuscitation (n=9) or the SPTP spray  system (n=10), which consisted of a spray device and a 14 Fr catheter. Using the  spray system, SPTP was delivered into a hemoperitoneum identified using a focused  assessment with sonography in trauma (FAST) exam. Lactated Ringer's solution was  administered to all animals to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of >50  mmHg. The primary outcome was percentage of animals surviving at three hours  following injury. RESULTS: In the swine model of NCIAH, a greater percentage of  animals receiving SPTP survived to three hours, although differences were not  significant. The SPTP spray system increased the median survival of animals from  1.6 hr in the fluid resuscitation group to 4.3 hr. The SPTP spray system  delivered a total mass of 18.5 ± 1.0 g of SPTP. The mean change in  intra-abdominal pressure following SPTP delivery was 5.2 ± 1.8 mmHg (mean ± SEM).  The intervention time was 6.7 ± 1.7 min. No adverse effects related to the SPTP  formulation or the spray system were observed. SPTP was especially beneficial in  animals that had either severely elevated lactate concentrations or low mean  arterial pressure of <35 mmHg shortly after injury. CONCLUSIONS: This  demonstrates proof-of-concept for use of a new minimally invasive procedure for  managing NCIAH, which could extend survival time to enable patients to reach  definitive surgical care.

AB  - AIM: Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a major cause of death worldwide with no approved treatment. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)  and diastolic dysfunction represent the structural and functional components of  HFpEF, respectively. Endothelial dysfunction is prevalent in HFpEF and predicts  cardiovascular events. We investigated if SAR247799, a G-protein-biased  sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1) agonist with endothelial-protective  properties, could improve cardiac and renal functions in a rat model of metabolic  syndrome LVH and diastolic function. METHODS: 31- and 65-week-old obese ZSF1  (Ob-ZSF1) rats, representing adult and aged animals with LVH and diastolic  dysfunction, were randomized to a chow diet containing 0.025% (w/w) of SAR247799,  or control (CTRL) chow for 4 weeks. Age-matched lean ZSF1 (Le-ZSF1) rats were fed  control chow. Echocardiography, telemetry, biochemical and histological analysis  were performed to evaluate the effect of SAR247799. RESULTS: Echocardiography  revealed that Ob-ZSF1 rats, in contrast to Le-ZSF1 rats, developed progressive  diastolic dysfunction and cardiac hypertrophy with age. SAR247799 blunted the  progression of diastolic dysfunction in adult and aged animals: in adult animals  E/e' was evaluated at 21.8 ± 1.4 for Ob-ZSF1-CTRL, 19.5 ± 1.2 for  Ob-ZSF1-SAR247799 p<0.01, and 19.5 ± 2.3 for Le-ZSF1-CTRL (median ± IQR). In aged  animals E/e' was evaluated at 23.15 ± 4.45 for Ob-ZSF1-CTRL, 19.5 ± 5 for  Ob-ZSF1-SAR247799 p<0.01, and 16.69 ± 1.7 for Le-ZSF1-CTRL, p<0.01 (median ±  IQR). In aged animals, SAR247799 reduced cardiac hypertrophy (g/mm mean ± SEM of  heart weight/tibia length 0.053 ± 0.001 for Ob-ZSF1-CTRL vs 0.046 ± 0.002 for  Ob-ZSF1-SAR247799 p<0.01, Le-ZSF1-CTRL 0.035 ± 0.001) and myocardial perivascular  collagen content (p<0.001), independently of any changes in microvascular  density. In adult animals, SAR247799 improved endothelial function as assessed by  the very low frequency bands of systolic blood pressure variability (mean ± SEM  67.8 ± 3.41 for Ob-ZSF1-CTRL 55.8 ± 4.27 or Ob-ZSF1-SAR247799, p<0.05 and 57.3 ±  1.82 Le-ZSF1-CTRL), independently of any modification of arterial blood pressure.  In aged animals, SAR247799 reduced urinary protein/creatinine ratio, an index of  glomerular injury, (10.3 ± 0.621 vs 8.17 ± 0.231 for Ob-ZSF1-CTRL vs  Ob-ZSF1-SAR247799, respectively, p<0.05 and 0.294 ± 0.029 for Le-ZSF1-CTRL, mean  ± SEM) and the fractional excretion of electrolytes. Circulating lymphocytes were  not decreased by SAR247799, confirming lack of S1P1 desensitization. CONCLUSIONS:  These experimental findings suggest that S1P1 activation with SAR247799 may be  considered as a new therapeutic approach for LVH and diastolic dysfunction, major  components of HFpEF.

AB  - Sub-epidermal moisture is an established biophysical marker of pressure ulcer formation based on biocapacitance changes in affected soft tissues, which has  been shown to facilitate early detection of these injuries. Artificial  intelligence shows great promise in wound prevention and care, including in  automated analyses of quantitative measures of tissue health such as  sub-epidermal moisture readings acquired over time for effective,  patient-specific, and anatomical-site-specific pressure ulcer prophylaxis. Here,  we developed a novel machine learning algorithm for early detection of heel deep  tissue injuries, which was trained using a database comprising six consecutive  daily sub-epidermal moisture measurements recorded from 173 patients in acute and  post-acute care settings. This algorithm was able to achieve strong predictive  power in forecasting heel deep tissue injury events the next day, with  sensitivity and specificity of 77% and 80%, respectively, revealing the clinical  potential of artificial intelligence-powered technology for hospital-acquired  pressure ulcer prevention. The current work forms the scientific basis for  clinical implementation of machine learning algorithms that provide effective,  early, and anatomy-specific preventive interventions to minimise the occurrence  of hospital-acquired pressure ulcers based on routine tissue health status  measurements.

AB  - High Hydrostatic Pressure (HHP) technology is considered an alternative method of food preservation. Nevertheless, the current dogma is that HHP might be  insufficient to preserve food lastingly against some pathogens. Incompletely  damaged cells can resuscitate under favorable conditions, and they may  proliferate in food during storage. This study was undertaken to characterize the  extent of sublethal injuries induced by HHP (300-500 MPa) on Escherichia coli and  Listeria inncua strains. The morphological changes were evaluated using  microscopy methods such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission  Electron Microscopy (TEM), and Epifluorescence Microscopy (EFM). The overall  assessment of the physiological state of tested bacteria through TEM and SEM  showed that the action of pressure on the structure of the bacterial membrane was  almost minor or unnoticeable, beyond the L. innocua wild-type strain. However,  alterations were observed in subcellular structures such as the cytoplasm and  nucleoid for both L. innocua and E. coli strains. More significant changes after  the HHP of internal structures were reported in the case of wild-type strains  isolated from raw juice. Extreme condensation of the cytoplasm was observed,  while the outline of cells was intact. The percentage ratio between alive and  injured cells in the population was assessed by fluorescent microscopy. The  results of HHP-treated samples showed a heterogeneous population, and red cell  aggregates were observed. The percentage ratio of live and dead cells (L/D) in  the L. innocua collection strain population was higher than in the case of the  wild-type strain (69%/31% and 55%/45%, respectively). In turn, E. coli  populations were characterized with a similar L/D ratio. Half of the cells in the  populations were distinguished as visibly fluorescing red. The results obtained  in this study confirmed sublethal HHP reaction on pathogens cells.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevention of pressure injuries/ulcers (PI/PUs) in patients at the end of life is achievable, albeit challenging. Objective diagnostic tools,  such as sub-epidermal moisture (SEM) scanning, support healthcare practitioners'  clinical judgment in preventing PI/PUs. AIM: A pragmatic study was conducted to  assess the feasibility of preventing PI/PUs using SEM technology as an adjunct to  routine care in a 22-bed inpatient hospice. METHODS: Daily SEM scanning was  introduced to support the device-trained practitioners' clinical judgment in  detecting developing, non-visible PI/PUs. Preventive interventions were initiated  by clinical judgment informed by Waterlow scores, visible, tactile skin and  tissue assessments and scanner readings. RESULTS: Prior to the study, the  incidence of PI/PUs was 9%. The 6 month study period reported a 4.8% PI/PU  incidence, 7/146 consenting patients developed a PI/PU, resulting in a 47%  reduction in incidence rates. CONCLUSION: Preventing the development of PI/PUs is  possible with clinical judgment aided by SEM data.

AB  - The main objective of this study was to investigate the effects of bacterial cellulose hydrogel (BCH) incorporated into montmorillonite (MMT) and its  underlying mechanisms of action on a skin wound healing mouse model following  pressure injury model. Komagataeibacter hansenii was used to obtain 5 cm in  diameter and 0.8 mm of thickness circular bacterial cellulose (BC) sheets, which  were incorporated with MMT by deposition ex-site using a 0.1% MMT suspension  (100 rpm for 24 h at 28 °C). Afterward, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy  (FT-IR) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) were used to characterize the  bacterial cellulose hydrogel incorporated into montmorillonite (BCH-MMT). The  pressure injury model was assessed by macroscopic and histological analysis in  male Swiss mice. Both, BC and BCH-MMT, showed a typical FTIR spectrum of  cellulosic substrates with pronounces bands around 3344, 2920, 1637, and  1041 cm(-1) while microparticles of MMT dispersed uniformly throughout BC were  revealed by SEM photographs. Animals treated with BCH-MMT showed significant  healing of pressure ulcers as demonstrated by reduced area of redness and  spontaneous hyperalgesia, lower amounts of in-site inflammatory cells (to the  same level as the positive control Dersani®) and ultimately, complete epidermis  re-epithelialization and tissue regeneration. Altogether, these findings suggest  that a modified BCH-MMT film could serve as scaffolding for skin tissue  engineering and potentially as a novel dressing material for pressure injury.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A pressure ulcer (PU) is a localized injury to the skin or underlying tissue usually over a bony prominence. The prevention PU per patient per day is  costly; therefore, the detection of a PU at its earliest stage is imperative to  afford timely interventions. Currently, there are very few clinically useful  tools to assist with early PU detection and prevention. AIM: There were two  primary aims of this study: (1) to investigate the relationship between activity,  mobility, and PU development; and (2) to ascertain the next steps for delineating  an algorithm based on activity and mobility for detecting PU risk among older  adult residents in long-term care. METHOD: This quantitative, prospective,  descriptive, non-experimental study was conducted between July 2019 and March  2020 among 53 older adult residents who were followed for 4 consecutive days.  Participants' Braden score, Elderly Mobility Scale (EMS) score, Movement Level,  and 6-item Cognitive Impairment Test score were assessed. Further, the sacrum and  heels were assessed daily using a non-invasive subepidermal moisture (SEM)  scanner and visual skin assessment (VSA). SEM values > 0.5 were considered as  indicative of the presence of an SEM-PU. RESULTS: The incidence rate of VSA-PU  was 15.1% (N = 8). There was an incidence of 87.5% (N = 42) of SEM-PU damage.  According to the Braden subscale, Mobility Braden, most of the participants  (62.2%, N = 33) were assessed as having no limitations/slightly limited mobility,  while the EMS indicated that most of the participants (67.9%, N = 36) were  classed in an independent category. From the 42 SEM-PUs observed, 62% (N = 26)  occurred among the low movers, and 38% (N = 16) occurred among the high movers.  LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION: Using traditional methods for the assessment of  movement does not provide insight into the protective nature of the movement.  Given that both low- and high-moving patients can develop tissue damage, it is  important to focus on the assessment of movement using more objective measures  and algorithms, which enable real-time assessment of the protective nature of the  movement. This would enable development of person-centered PU prevention  strategies to reduce the burden of this significant healthcare problem.

AB  - Compartment syndrome (CS) is a pathological event caused by elevated intracompartmental pressure (ICP); however, changes from the onset of inducing  atraumatic CS remained unclear. The study aimed to investigate the physiological  changes in a newly developed in vivo porcine acute atraumatic CS model. CS was  induced by ischemia-reperfusion injury in the left hind leg of fourteen pigs  divided into an echogenicity group (EG) and a shear wave elastography group  (SEG). Echogenicity was measured in EG, and shear elastic modulus (SEM) was  measured in SEG seven times before, at the onset of inducing CS, and every 30 min  after the onset over eight hours. Simultaneously, ICP, blood pressure, and muscle  perfusion pressure (MPP) were also measured in both groups. Our results indicate  that SEM of the experimental leg in SEG significantly increased as CS developed  compared to the control leg (p = 0.027), but no statistical difference in the  echogenicity in EG was found between the experimental leg and control leg. There  were also significant correlations between SEM and ICP (p < 0.001) and ICP and  MPP (p < 0.001). Our method and findings can be a basis to develop a non-invasive  diagnostic tool using a shear wave elastography for atraumatic CS.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to first fabricate an electrospun PVC nanofiber web and then assess its applicability in sampling and measuring the concentration  of airborne crystalline silica by comparing analysis results with a commercial  PVC membrane filter under different ranges of airborne silica concentration. A  filtration performance comparison was also made between an electrospun PVC web  with nano-sized fibers and a commercial PVC membrane filter. Overall, the  measured concentration of silica by the electrospun webs was 1.022 times higher  than that of the commercial PVC filter in all studied ranges of silica  concentration and the nanofiber media had higher filtration efficiency and lower  pressure drop compared to the PVC membrane filter. This can be considered to be  due to the lower fiber diameter and greater porosity (obtained from the 2D SEM  image) of the electrospun nanofiber webs. This makes them suited for air  pollutant sampling and determining its airborne concentration.

TI  - The benefits of using a first generation SEM scanner versus an equipment selection pathway in preventing HAPUs.
AU  - Ropper, Ruth
T2  - British journal of nursing (Mark Allen Publishing)
AB  - Several studies have demonstrated improved clinical outcomes in pressure ulcer prevention using the SEM scanner, but none have compared it with other methods.  In one of Scotland's health boards, 'hot spot' wards had been unable to reduce  the number of hospital-acquired pressure ulcers (HAPUs) after several years of  focused improvement work. In addition, other wards showed high use of dynamic  therapy systems with associated costs. This review compares the use of a first  generation SEM scanner versus a mattress and equipment selection pathway over a  6-week period. The findings show that the SEM scanner wards had zero HAPU while  the equipment pathway wards developed a total of 4 HAPU. The two SEM scanner  wards showed a 11% and 33% reduction in dynamic therapy use, while the pathway  wards showed an average 40% increase. Consideration should be given to using SEM  scanners to support staff decision-making to reduce HAPU development and dynamic  therapy usage.

AB  - AIMS: In vivo experiments were performed to establish and validate a rat model of urethral sphincter injury and to develop a method for leak point pressure (LPP)  measurements performed repeatedly in the same animal. METHODS: Twenty-four  Sprague-Dawley female rats underwent bladder and epidural catheter implantation.  Five days later, cystometry was performed using continuous infusion. Anesthesia  with isoflurane, ketamine-xylazine (KX) or fentanyl-fluanisone-midazolam (FFM)  was used. After three micturition cycles, intrathecal bupivacaine was  administered leading to the suppression of reflex bladder contractions. LPP  measurements were performed using vertical tilt. After the initial LPP  measurement, animals underwent partial resection of the striated urethral  sphincter. The effect was evaluated 6 weeks after surgery, by repeating the LPP  measurement in the same animal. RESULTS: Ten out of 19 animals showed full  micturition cycles under isoflurane, and all 9 animals under KX anesthesia. No  significant difference in micturition pressures (Mean ± SEM; 30.1 ± 2.3 vs.  26.8 ± 1.6 mmHg) and LPP (31.0 ± 2.4 vs. 28.0 ± 0.9 mmHg) was observed between  isoflurane and KX groups, respectively. Reflex micturition was suppressed with  FFM. Bupivacaine led to overflow incontinence in all cases. Sphincter injury  caused fibrotic changes and a significant increase in LPP (26.4 ± 2.3 before vs.  46.9 ± 4.6 mmHg after injury, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: KX anesthesia preserves  bladder contractions. Intrathecal bupivacaine eliminates reflex micturition,  allowing for repeated LPP measurements in the same animal. Resection of striated  sphincter resulted in increased LPP 6 weeks post injury. The site of urethral  sphincter resection healed with fibrosis.

T2  - Expert review of medical devices
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Pressure injuries (PIs) are a global health concern. Current PI care standards, including skin tissue assessments (STA) and health care  professional (HCP) clinical judgment, diagnose visibly manifested PIs on the  skin's surface, i.e. after the damage has already occurred. However, objective  assessment of early-stage, non-visible, pressure-induced tissue damage is  clinically impossible within the current standard of care. The SEM Scanner is the  first device authorized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that addresses  this unmet clinical need. AREAS COVERED: This review describes the novel  sub-epidermal moisture (SEM) scanning technology of the device and summarizes the  clinical safety and efficacy data that support the use of the scanner in routine  PI care practice. EXPERT OPINION: The clinical strategy for developing the SEM  Scanner is noteworthy. SEM technology using anatomy-specific data enables HCPs to  provide early PI prevention interventions before visible signs of tissue damage  develop while the damage is still reversible. When adopted into routine practice,  the device identifies an increased risk of developing PIs 5 days (median) earlier  than STA. FDA clearance was based on bench studies and data from three  foundational trials that demonstrate the diagnostic accuracy of the device  algorithm significantly exceeding clinical judgment (p < 0.001).

AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence of pressure injury/ulcers is persistent despite multiple prevention strategies in hospitals across the globe. Current standard of  pressure injury/ulcer care supported by subjective skin tissue assessments, risk  assessment tools and clinical judgement is ineffective in consistent pressure  injury/ulcer prevention. AIM: A pragmatic study, aligning with SQUIRE guidelines,  was conducted at Chelsea and Westminster hospitals to measure the impact of  adding scanning technology to the prevailing standard of care pathway on the  incidence of category 2-4 hospital-acquired pressure injury/ulcers. METHODS: Six  hundred and ninety-seven mixed-population patients at risk for pressure  injuries/ulcers with a Waterlow score of ≥10 and a mean age ≥65 years were  enrolled across four wards over a 6-month period. Scanning technology was added  to the prevailing standard of care as a device adjunctive to clinical judgement  for the detection of deep and early-stage pressure-induced tissue damage. Ward  staff completed comprehensive device training by the device manufacturer.  Clinical interventions were initiated by clinical judgement informed by  injury/ulcer risk assessments, skin and tissue assessments and scanner readings.  Incidence of reportable category 2-4 pressure injuries/ulcers from the prior  12-month period from the same wards were used as a control comparator population.  All diagnosed category 2-4 pressure injuries/ulcers, unstageable and deep-tissue  injuries were recorded. RESULTS: Prior study 12-month pressure injury/ulcer  incidence was 0.6% (5/892 patients) in ward A, 4.4% (9/206 patients) in Ward B,  1.1% (12/1,123 patients) in Ward C and 2.6% (16/625 patients) in Ward D. Two  pressure injury/ulcers in Ward B were recorded during the study. Zero pressure  injuries/ulcers were recorded in the remaining three wards resulting in an 81%  incidence reduction across all four wards. Improved clinical decisions from  clinical judgement based on Sub-Epidermal Moisture (SEM) Scanner data were  reported in 83% patients (n=578/697). CONCLUSION: Implementing scanning  technology into routine clinical practice achieves consistent reductions in  pressure injury/ulcer incidence.

AB  - The mechanical behavior of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) affects the interaction between vehicle occupants and restraint systems in motor vehicle  crashes (MVCs). To enhance future restraints, injury countermeasures, and other  vehicle safety systems, computational simulations are often used to augment  experiments because of their relative efficiency for parametric analysis. How  well finite element human body models (FE-HBMs), which are often used in such  simulations, predict human response has been limited by the absence of material  models for human SAT that are applicable to the MVC environment. In this study,  for the first time, dynamic multidirectional unconfined compression and simple  shear loading tests were performed on human abdominal SAT specimens under  conditions similar to MVCs. We also performed multiple ramp-hold tests to  evaluate the quasilinear viscoelasticity (QLV) assumption and capture the stress  relaxation behavior under both compression and shear. Our mechanical  characterization was supplemented with scanning electron microscopy (SEM)  performed in different orientations to investigate whether the macrostructural  response can be related to the underlying microstructure. While the overall  structure was shown to be visually different in different anatomical planes, a  preferred orientation of any fibrous structures could not be identified. We  showed that the nonlinear, viscoelastic, and direction-dependent responses under  compression and shear tests could be captured by incorporating QLV in an  Ogden-type hyperelastic model. Our comprehensive approach will lead to more  accurate computational simulations and support the collective effort on the  research of future occupant protection systems. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: There  is an urgent need to characterize the mechanical behavior of human adipose tissue  under multiple dynamic loading conditions, and to identify constitutive models  that are able to capture the tissue response under these conditions. We performed  the first series of experiments on human adipose tissue specimens to characterize  the multi-directional compression and shear behavior at impact loading rates and  obtained scanning electron microscope images to investigate whether the  macrostructural response can be related to the underlying microstructure. The  results showed that human adipose tissue is nonlinear, viscoelastic and direction  dependent, and its mechanical response under compression and shear tests at  different loading rates can be captured by incorporating quasi-linear  viscoelasticity in an Ogden-type hyperelastic model.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of lower extremity intermittent negative pressure (INP) treatment for 1 hour twice daily for 12  weeks, on circulating vascular biomarkers in patients with intermittent  claudication. Patients were randomized to treatment with -40 mmHg INP (treatment  group), or -10 mmHg INP (sham control group). Venous blood samples were collected  at baseline and after 12 weeks, and concentrations of vascular adhesion  molecule-1 (VCAM-1), intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), E-selectin,  P-selectin, von Willebrand factor (vWF), l-arginine, asymmetric dimethylarginine  (ADMA), and symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) were analyzed. A larger proportion  of the patients in the treatment group (25/31) had a reduction in vWF levels  after 12 weeks, compared to the sham control group (17/30) (p = 0.043). Within  the treatment group there was a significant mean (SEM) reduction in the  concentration of vWF of -11% (4) (p = 0.019), whereas there was no significant  change in the levels of vWF in the sham control group (1% (6); p = 0.85). There  were no significant differences in the change of any of the biomarker levels  between the groups after 12 weeks of treatment. In conclusion, there were no  differences in the change of the circulating levels of the measured biomarkers  between the treatment group and the sham control group after 12 weeks of INP  treatment. However, the observed changes in vWF might indicate a beneficial  effect of INP treatment on endothelial activation and endothelial injury.  Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT03640676.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The renal medulla is susceptible to hypoxia during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), which may contribute to the development of acute kidney injury. But  the speed of onset of renal medullary hypoxia remains unknown. METHODS: We  continuously measured renal medullary oxygen tension (MPO(2)) in 24 sheep, and  urinary PO(2) (UPO(2)) as an index of MPO(2) in 92 patients, before and after  induction of CPB. RESULTS: In laterally recumbent sheep with a right thoracotomy  (n = 20), even before CPB commenced MPO(2) fell from (mean ± SEM) 52 ± 4 to  41 ±5 mmHg simultaneously with reduced arterial pressure (from 108 ± 5 to  88 ± 5 mmHg). In dorsally recumbent sheep with a medial sternotomy (n = 4),  MPO(2) was even more severely reduced (to 12 ± 12 mmHg) before CPB. In laterally  recumbent sheep in which a crystalloid prime was used (n = 7), after commencing  CPB, MPO(2) fell abruptly to 24 ±6 mmHg within 20-30 minutes. MPO(2) during CPB  was not improved by adding donor blood to the prime (n = 13). In patients  undergoing cardiac surgery, UPO(2) fell by 4 ± 1 mmHg and mean arterial pressure  fell by 7 ± 1 mmHg during the 30 minutes before CPB. UPO(2) then fell by a  further 12 ± 2 mmHg during the first 30 minutes of CPB but remained relatively  stable for the remaining 24 minutes of observation. CONCLUSIONS: Renal medullary  hypoxia is an early event during CPB. It starts to develop even before CPB,  presumably due to a pressure-dependent decrease in renal blood flow. Medullary  hypoxia during CPB appears to be promoted by hypotension and is not ameliorated  by increasing blood hemoglobin concentration.

AB  - Medical device-related pressure ulcers (MDRPUs) were traditionally associated with skin-contacting medical devices applied to patients, eventually causing  tissue damage. The coronavirus-2019 pandemic has brought a new variant of MDRPUs:  facial skin irritation or damage associated with extended use of protective  personal equipment (PPE), e.g. facemasks and respirators. In this context, we  report here a comprehensive experimental evaluation including facial contact  forces, skin temperatures and sub-epidermal moisture (SEM) measurements  pre/post-PPE usage, to determine how these physiological parameters change under  the effects of surgical facemasks and KN95 respirators and whether such potential  changes can explain the commonly reported skin irritation or damage. We found  that a surgical mask is potentially less irritating to facial skin than the KN95  respirator, as it applies lower forces and facilitates faster return of facial  temperatures to their basal levels. Further, we demonstrated that use of dressing  cuts for padding under a KN95 respirator considerably reduced localized forces  and did not worsen the thermal and SEM readings at the skin-device contact sites.  This study provides a basis for improvement of PPE designs, as it describes  physiological measurement methodologies for quantitative comparisons of the  effects of different PPE types on facial skin status.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Skin is constantly exposed to mechanical and chemical insults, in the form of prolonged loading, overhydration or exposure to irritants. An array of  non-invasive biophysical tools has been adopted to monitor the changes in skin  response. The present study aims to identify a set of robust parameters sensitive  to mechanical and chemical challenges to skin integrity. MATERIALS AND METHODS:  Eleven healthy participants were recruited to evaluate the skin response  following mechanical loading, tape stripping, overhydration and chemical  irritation. Forearm skin responses were recorded at baseline and at three time  points following the insult. Measurements included transepidermal water loss,  sub-epidermal moisture, erythema and laser Doppler imaging. Thresholds were  informed by basal values, and the sensitivity of parameters to detect skin  changes was evaluated. RESULTS: High degree of variability in skin response was  observed with selected biophysical parameters, such as sub-epidermal moisture,  laser Doppler imaging and erythema, even in the absence of an applied insult.  Temporal skin response revealed distinct response profiles during each evoked  insult. Indeed, the sensitivity of the biophysical parameters was influenced by  the threshold values and time point of measurement. Some statistically  significant correlations were determined between the biophysical parameters.  CONCLUSION: The study revealed that thresholds derived from single biophysical  parameters were limited in detecting skin changes following insults. A  complementary evaluation using combined parameters has the potential to provide a  more sensitive assessment. Further research is required to identify robust  biophysical parameters, to aid the early detection of skin damage in clinical  settings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Technologies have been developed to monitor changes in dermal oedema, indicative of the early signs of pressure ulcers. However, there is limited  information on the effects of regional differences in tissue morphology on these  sub-epidermal moisture (SEM) parameters. This study was designed to investigate  the absolute SEM readings across different anatomical sites using a commercial  device. METHODS: Twenty-four healthy participants were recruited to evaluate  basal SEM values at different bony prominences, sampled by an experienced  operator. RESULTS: Distinct differences were observed in unloaded SEM values  across different anatomical sites, notably between the upper and lower  extremities. A high degree of variability was observed in particular sites, such  as the heels. Moreover, SEM values at certain locations revealed significant  relationships with age, BMI and gender (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The study revealed  a high level of variability between and within anatomical sites in a healthy  cohort of participants. Determining the changes in local skin and sub-dermal  tissue status using SEM may require consideration of both site specific and  individual demographic factors, with further research needed in cohorts at risk  of pressure ulcers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is an unmet need for suitable ex vivo large animal models in experimental gastroenterology and intestinal transplantation. This study details  a reliable and effective technique for ex vivo normothermic perfusion (EVNP) of  segmental porcine small intestine. METHODS: Segments of small intestine, 1.5-3.0  m in length, were retrieved from terminally anaesthetized pigs. After a period of  cold ischaemia, EVNP was performed for 2 h at 37°C with a mean pressure of 80  mmHg using oxygenated autologous blood diluted with Ringer's solution. The  duration of EVNP was extended to 4 h for a second set of experiments in which two  segments of proximal to mid-ileum (1.5-3.0 m) were retrieved from each animal and  reperfused with whole blood (control) or leucocyte-depleted blood to examine the  impact of leucocyte depletion on reperfusion injury. RESULTS: After a mean cold  ischaemia time of 5 h and 20 min, EVNP was performed in an initial group of four  pigs. In the second set of experiments, five pigs were used in each group. In all  experiments bowel segments were well perfused and exhibited peristalsis during  EVNP. Venous glucose levels significantly increased following luminal glucose  stimulation (mean(s.e.m.) basal level 1.8(0.6) mmol/l versus peak 15.5(5.8)  mmol/l; P < 0.001) and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) levels increased in all  experiments, demonstrating intact absorptive and secretory intestinal functions.  There were no significant differences between control and leucocyte-depleted  animals regarding blood flow, venous glucose, GLP-1 levels or histopathology at  the end of 4 h of EVNP. CONCLUSIONS: This novel model is suitable for the  investigation of gastrointestinal physiology, pathology and ischaemia reperfusion  injury, along with evaluation of potential therapeutic interventions.

T2  - Journal of wound care
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The presence of sub-epidermal moisture (SEM) over a bony prominence is indicative of incipient pressure ulcer (pressure injury/decubitus/bedsore) (PU).  Early identification of patients at increased risk of PU can prompt interventions  that reduce the incidence and severity of hospital (or community)-acquired PUs  (HAPUs). This study evaluated the clinical utility of a SEM Scanner device in  HAPU management. METHOD: The study used a pragmatic 'real-world' approach. HAPU  data before and during SEM Scanner use were obtained through routine audit.  Patients had regular visual and daily SEM Scanner skin assessments over the  sacrum and heels. Nursing care otherwise followed standard of care according to  the established protocols of individual participating sites. HAPU incidence rates  were determined and feedback gathered from health professionals on how the device  influenced HAPU-related clinical decision-making. RESULTS: There were 15  participating sites: 13 acute care, one palliative care and one community care  setting. The sample size was 1478 patients. All sites reported a substantial  reduction in mean HAPU incidence: 87.2% in acute care settings; 46.7% in the  palliative care setting and 26.7% in the community care setting. A 100% incidence  reduction was reported in 10 (66.7%) sites. In the palliative care setting, SEM  Scanner results changed HAPU-related clinical decision-making for 40% of patients  scanned. The community care site demonstrated a 82% change in clinical  decision-making. CONCLUSION: In this study, SEM analysis fitted seamlessly into  routine skin assessment and enabled early identification of increased risk of  tissue damage, with clinically important reductions in the incidence of HAPU  across all participating sites.

T2  - Journal of wound care
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the pathophysiological cascade of pressure ulcer (PU) development consisting of tissue deformation, inflammation and hypoxia. METHOD:  In this crossover study, deformation was measured with computerised tomography  (CT) linked with contact area reflecting immersion and envelopment. Inflammation  and hypoxia were measured using subepidermal moisture (SEM), skin temperature and  tissue perfusion with positron emission tomography. These variables were  investigated under 90 minutes of pressure exposure caused by two functionally  different support surfaces-a regular foam mattress and a minimum pressure air  (MPA) mattress. RESULTS: A total of eight healthy volunteers took part in the  study. There was major tissue deformation when the participants lay on a foam  mattress while the tissues retained their original shape on the MPA mattress  (p<0.0001). During the pressure exposure, the skin temperature increased  significantly on both support surfaces but the final temperature on the foam  mattress was about 1oC higher than on the MPA mattress (p<0.0001). SEM increased  on both support surfaces compared with an unexposed reference site, but the cause  may be different between the two support surfaces. Tissue perfusion was lowest in  the skin followed by subcutaneous tissues and highest in the muscles. The  pressure exposure did not cause any substantial changes in perfusion. The results  showed that tissue deformation was more pronounced, the support surface contact  area (envelopment), was smaller and the skin temperature higher on the foam  mattress than on the MPA mattress, without significant differences in tissue  perfusion. CONCLUSION: In this study, the MPA mattress support surface had  mechanobiological properties that counteracted tissue deformation and thereby may  prevent PUs.

T2  - Journal of wound care
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sub-epidermal moisture (SEM) is a measurable biomarker detecting early pressure damage in order to objectively support current 'gold standard'  skin tissue assessments (STA) for the detection of deep and early-stage  pressure-induced injuries or ulcers (PI/PUs). OBJECTIVE: A multi-site, dual arm,  cross sectional, retrospective study was conducted to evaluate the sensitivity,  specificity and clinical utility of spatial variation in SEM readings between  healthy and damaged skin tissue. METHOD: The study enrolled 175 subjects: 125  with confirmed PI/PUs or suspected deep tissue injury (sDTI), and 50 confirmed  healthy subjects. Expert principal investigators and PI/PU healthcare  practitioners (HCPs) evaluating all subjects were trained in SEM measurements but  blinded to clinical interpretation of SEM readings. Sequential and spatial SEM  readings of the sacrum and heels, subjects' demographic data, STAs, risk  assessment tool scores (RATS), pain assessment and potential confounders were  recorded. Independent statistical analyses were performed. RESULTS: Mean spatial  SEM measures within subjects with healthy tissue and within subjects with damaged  tissue were statistically similar. Mean spatial SEM measures within anatomies of  subjects with damaged tissue were significantly different (p<0.05). There was no  significant difference between spatial readings in healthy subjects. Algorithms  computing a range of SEM delta thresholds indicated a sensitivity of 82-87% and a  specificity of 51-88% at an SEM delta ≥0.6. Receiver operating characteristic  (ROC) curves computed areas under the curve (AUC) of 0.7809-0.9181 (95% CI:  0.7221-0.8817, 0.8397-0.9545, p<0.0001) exceeding clinical judgement. CONCLUSION:  These SEM data augment clinical decision-making for developing intact skin PI/PUs  including sDTIs and Stage I PI/PUs. Informing HCPs of this subclinical,  non-visible skin and tissue damage and providing opportunities for alternative  PI/PU care pathways is an exciting prospect.

AB  - PURPOSE: To describe relationships between subepidermal moisture (SEM) and visual skin assessment of pressure injury (PI) in children. DESIGN: Prospective  descriptive study. SUBJECTS AND SETTING: Twenty-four participants aged 8 to 16  years recruited from a pediatric orthopedic unit in a children's hospital in  Ireland. METHODS: Subepidermal moisture measured with the SEM scanner (Bruin  Biometrics, Los Angeles, California) ranged from 0 to 7 picoFarads [pF], and  visual observation of trunk and heels occurred daily for 3 days after admission  to the unit and/or after surgery. Skin was assessed for discoloration categorized  as blanchable erythema, stage 1 PI, or deep tissue injury (DTI). Any open wound  PI was classified as stage 2, 3, 4, or unstageable. Demographic, medical, and  pain data were collected. Chi-square test, t tests, analysis of variance, and  regression were used to describe data and examine relationships. RESULTS:  Participants were pediatric patients; 100% (n = 24) were white, 62% (n = 15) were  female, 8 to 16 years of age (mean = 12.5 ± 2.5 years), and 29% (n = 7) had  fractures and 71% (n = 17) surgery diagnoses. Blanchable erythema incidence was  21% (n = 5) and stage 1 PI incidence was 42% (n = 10); nearly all at heels. Deep  tissue injury incidence was 4% (one sacral DTI). Stage 2 or greater PI incidence  was 4% (one heel stage 2 PI). For skin that was assessed as normal in this  pediatric population, SEM for trunk was 2.65 to 2.76 pF and for heels 2.37 to  2.41 pF. Subepidermal moisture for blanchable erythema and stage 1 PI was higher  (range, 3.2-3.7 pF) and significant at trochanters and heels (left trochanter: P  = .003; right trochanter: P = .02; right and left heels: P = .000). Nominal  regression, controlling for participant and assessment day, showed SEM a  predictor of erythema and stage 1 PI at heels. We also found that SEM was higher  with pain (significant at sacrum and heels). CONCLUSIONS: In this pediatric  population, SEM values over skin assessed as normal are lower than SEM values  reported for normal skin in adults, 2.37 to 2.76 pF. Subepidermal moisture was  significantly higher for blanchable erythema and stage 1 PI at trochanters and  heels, and with the presence of pain at sacrum and heels. We recommend that SEM  should be examined for detecting PIs in pediatric populations; SEM and pain  should be explored in larger pediatric and adult populations.

AB  - Uncontrolled hemorrhage often causes death during traumatic injuries and halting exsanguination topically is a challenge. Here, an efficient multimodal topical  hemostat was developed by (i) ionically crosslinking chitosan and gelatin with  sodium tripolyphosphate for (ii) fabricating a robust, highly porous xerogel by  lyophilization having 86.7 % porosity, by micro-CT and large pores ∼30 μm by SEM  (iii) incorporating 0.5 mg synthesized silica nanoparticles (SiNPs, 120 nm size,  -22 mV charge) and 2.5 mM calcium in xerogel composite that was confirmed by FTIR  analysis with peaks at 3372, 986 and 788 cm(-1), respectively. XPS analysis  displayed the presence of SiNPs (Si2p peak for silicon) and calcium (Ca2p1, Ca2p3  transition peaks) in the composite. Interestingly, in silico percolation  simulation for composite revealed interlinked 800 μm long-conduits predicting  excellent absorption capacity and validated experimentally (640 % of composite  dry weight). The composite achieved >16-fold improved blood clotting in vitro  than commercial Celox and Gauze through multimodal interaction of its components  with RBCs and platelets. The composite displayed good platelet activation and  thrombin generation activities. It displayed high compressive strength (2.45 MPa)  and withstood pressure during application. Moreover, xerogel composite showed  high biocompatibility. In vivo application of xerogel composite to lethal femoral  artery injury in rats achieved hemostasis (2.5 min) significantly faster than  commercial Celox (3.3 min) and Gauze (4.6 min) and was easily removed from the  wound. The gamma irradiated composite was stable till 1.5 yr. Therefore, the  xerogel composite has potential for application as a rapid topical hemostatic  agent.

AB  - This research aimed to develop a direct-write near-field electrospinning system (DW-NFES) with three-axis positioning of controllable speed, torque and position  to produce sizable and high-quality piezoelectric fibers for sensing purposes.  Sensor devices with high electrical response signals were developed and tested.  To achieve DW-NFES purpose, a servo motor controller was designed to develop a  high response rate, accurate positioning, and stable mobile device through the  calculation of bandwidth and system time delay. With this retooled system of  DW-NFES, controllable and uniform size fibers in terms of diameters, stretching  force, and interspaces can be obtained. Sensor devices can be made selectively  without a complicated lithography process. The characteristics of this DW-NFES  platform were featured by high response rate, accurate positioning, and stable  movement to make fibers with high piezoelectric property. In this study,  polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) was used to explore and enhance their sensing  quality through the platform. The parametric study of the process factors on  piezoelectric sensing signals mainly included the concentration of  electrospinning PVDF solution, high voltage electric field, and collection speed.  Finally, the surface morphology and piezoelectric properties of the  as-electrospun PVDF fibers were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM)  and characterized by electrical response measurement techniques. The results  showed that the fiber spinning speed of the DW-NFES system could be increased to  ~125 from ~20 mm/s and the accuracy precision was improved to ~1 from ~50 μm,  compared to conventional step motor system. The fiber diameter reached ~10 μm,  and the electrospinning pitch reached to as small as ~10 μm. The piezoelectric  output voltage of the electrospun fibers was increased ~28.6% from ~97.2 to ~125  mV; the current was increased ~27.6% from ~163 to ~208 nA, suggesting that the  piezoelectric signals can be enhanced significantly by using this retooled  system. Finally, an external control module (Arduino-MAGE) was introduced to  control the PVDF piezoelectric fiber sensors integrated as a sensing array. The  behavior of long-term sedentary patients can be successfully detected by this  module system to prevent the patients from the bedsores.

AB  - Cardiopulmonary functions such as respiratory depression, severe irritation, inflamed respiratory tract, hyperventilation and, tachycardia are the most  affected ones when it comes to the riot control agent oleoresin capsicum (OC)  exposure. However, no studies have been done to elucidate the mechanism  underlying deterioration of the combined cardiopulmonary functions. Parameters  such as acute respiratory, cardiac, parameters and ultrasonography (USG)  measurements were investigated in an in vivo setup using Wistar rats at 1 h and  24 h post inhalation exposure to 2%, 6% and 10% OC, whereas, cell migration in  rat peritoneal mast cells (RPMCs), metabolomics and eosinophil peroxidase (EPO)  activity in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were investigated in an in vitro  setup. Results obtained from electrophysiological recording indicated that OC  exposure produces apnea and decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP) was obtained  from hemodynamic parameters whereas cardiac parameters assessment revealed  increase in the level of cardiac output (CO) and decrease in stroke volume (SV)  with recovery towards the post-exposure period. A decrease in the percentage area  of certain fatty acid pathway metabolites in BALF appropriately linked the lung  injury following OC exposure which was further cemented by increasing  concentration of EPO. Histopathology and SEM also proved to be favorable  techniques for the detection of OC induced physiological cardiac and pulmonary  modifications respectively. Furthermore, Boyden chamber experiment established  the chemoattractant property of OC. It may be concluded from the above studies  that these newly reported facets may be utilized pharmacologically to mitigate  cardiopulmonary adverse effects owing to OC exposure.

AB  - This paper aims to discuss the literature pertaining to early pressure-shear induced tissue damage detection, with emphasis on sub-epidermal moisture  measurement (SEM). The current method for pressure detection is visual skin  assessment (VSA); however, this method is fraught with challenges. Advances in  early detection of pressure ulcers are reported in the literature and mainly  involve measuring inflammation markers on weight-bearing anatomical areas in  order to capture the first signs of tissue damage. One novel technique currently  in use is SEM measurement. This biophysical marker is the product of plasma that  leaks as a response to local inflammation arising due to pressure-shear induced  damage over bony prominences. The early detection of tissue damage is beneficial  in two different ways. First, it enables early intervention when the damage is  still microscopic and reversible and, therefore, has the potential to prevent  further aggravation of healthy surrounding tissue. This arises by avoiding the  causation of the problem and stopping the knock-on effect of inflammation,  especially when the rapid pressure ulceration pathway of deformation is in place.  Second, when the slow ischaemic-reperfusion related mechanism is undergoing, cell  death can be avoided when the problem is identified before the cell reaches the  "death threshold," completely averting a pressure ulcer.

AB  - Traumatic injuries affect approximately 978 million people worldwide with 56.2 million requiring inpatient care. Quantitative sensory testing (QST) can be  useful in predicting outcome following trauma, however the reliability of  multiple QST including temporal summation (TS), heat and cold pain thresholds  (HPT, CPT) and pressure pain thresholds (PPT) is unknown. We assessed intra  (between day) and inter-rater (within day) reliability of QST in asymptomatic  participants (n = 21), and inter-rater (within day) reliability in participants  presenting with acute musculoskeletal trauma (n = 25). Intra-class correlations  with 95% confidence intervals (ICC 3,2), standard error of measurement (SEM) and  Bland Altman Plots for limits of agreement were calculated. For asymptomatic  participants, reliability was good to excellent for HPT (ICC range 0.76-0.95),  moderate to good for PPT (ICC range 0.52-0.93), with one site rated poor (ICC  0.41), and poor to excellent for TS scores (ICC range 0.20-0.91). For  musculoskeletal trauma participants reliability was good to excellent for HPT and  PPT (ICC range 0.76-0.86), and moderate to good reliability for TS (ICC range  0.69-0.91). SEM for HPT for both sets of participants was ~1°C and an average of  7N for asymptomatic participants and less than 8N for acute musculoskeletal  trauma participants for PPT. This study demonstrates moderate to excellent intra  and inter-rater reliability for HPT and PPT in asymptomatic participants and good  to excellent inter-rater reliability for acute musculoskeletal trauma  participants, with TS showing more variability for both sets of participants.  This study provides foundations for future work evaluating the sensory function  over time following acute musculoskeletal trauma.

AB  - AIM: To identify how activity and mobility lead to pressure ulcer development, using two objective assessments, one for mobility and one for early pressure  ulcer detection. METHODS: 150 older persons from long-term settings were followed  up for 20 days, using an observational, quantitative, prospective study design.  The study was conducted in accordance with the Strengthening the Reporting of  Observational Studies in Epidemiology statement. Visual skin assessment and  sub-epidermal moisture assessments were undertaken daily. Activity was measured  using the Braden subscale. Further, a mobility profile of the participants was  identified using a piezoelectric motion sensor which provided a "movement score"  (mean number of movements/hour). Movement scores from 22 healthy participants  were also measured to better understand the mobility profile in a healthy  population. RESULTS: Pressure ulcer incidence using visual skin assessment was  12.7% (low movers = 6.7%; high movers = 6%) and 78.7% using sub-epidermal  moisture assessment (low movers = 40.0%; high movers = 38.7%). Sub-epidermal  moisture assessment detected pressure ulcers on average 8.2 days before they  appeared visually on the skin's surface. Pressure ulcer detection was 25 times  greater using sub-epidermal moisture compared to visual skin assessment.  Considering the results of the "movement level" assessment using the motion  sensor technology, of all those who were determined to be immobile by Braden,  18.8% were assessed as high movers. DISCUSSION & CONCLUSION: Pressure ulcers  occurred both in low and high movers, which was unexpected as a similar finding  has not been previously reported in the literature. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL  PRACTICE: The traditional focus on low movers/immobile individuals may detract  from the identification of those making an abnormally high frequency of unsafe  movements. Pressure ulcer assessment can be enhanced through a combination of  sub-epidermal moisture assessment and visual skin assessment, and through the  identification of both individuals with impaired mobility and those abnormally  high movements, such as among those who are agitated.

AB  - In the natural environment, the horns of yak possess remarkable structural mechanical properties to protect the head from injury. In this paper,  quasi-static compression and dynamic impact tests were conducted on yak horn in  different regions under axial and lateral conditions to evaluate mechanical  properties such as elastic modulus, ultimate strength and energy absorption.  Meanwhile, the failure deformation mechanism under both low and high strain rates  is explored. Moreover, experimental analysis of the correlation among mechanical  properties, sampling position, strain rate and loading direction was conducted.  Fracture surface of horn was observed with the scanning electron microscope  (SEM). Research data demonstrate that specific energy absorption and mechanical  properties are correlated with sampling position. Under quasi-static compression  and dynamic impact, clear anisotropy behavior of horn was observed, which is  evidently reflected in the load-displacement curve. Mechanical properties such as  elastic modulus and ultimate strength are different under quasi-static  compression and dynamic impact. The failure mode of lamellar buckling and  delamination existed in the axial failure process. Brittle fracture and extrusion  densification occurred more frequently in the process of lateral failure.

TI  - Using Subepidermal Moisture Level as an Indicator of Early Pressure Damage to Local Skin and Tissue.
AU  - Gershon, Steve
T2  - Advances in skin & wound care
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Inflammation triggered by tissue injury increases blood flow to the injured area, resulting in fluid accumulation below the epidermis known as  subepidermal moisture (SEM). This accumulation can be assessed using an SEM  scanner. The primary aim of this study was to determine whether levels of SEM  from repeated measures at a localized area confirm the absence of a pressure  injury at that site in healthy participants. METHODS: Fifty patients attending a  specialized pain clinic who were at very low risk of or unaffected by pressure  injuries were enrolled. Subepidermal moisture readings were gathered at the  center and near-proximate to the bony prominences of the heel and sacrum. MAIN  RESULTS: Among the participants, repeated localized measurements did not differ  significantly at or around a single anatomic site. The heel had a slightly higher  variation than the sacrum, although the variance was less than 0.6 SEM units,  indicating that there is likely no inflammation at these sites in patients who  are not at risk of pressure injuries and who show no visual signs of localized  tissue inflammation. Demographic and other potential confounder data were  gathered, but no statistically significant findings emerged from these data.  CONCLUSIONS: The relatively flat pattern of SEM values around the bony  prominences of the heels and sacrum in healthy participants supports the  hypothesis that healthy tissue is not inflamed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hospital-acquired pressure injuries strain organizational resources and negatively impact the quality of life of affected patients. However, early  detection of pressure injuries is limited due to challenges with visual  assessment, particularly in individuals with dark skin. PURPOSE: The purpose of  this systematic review was to determine whether sufficient research evidence  exists to support the use of bedside technologies for early detection of pressure  injures, which is inclusive of pressure-related blanchable erythema (PrBE),  pressure-related nonblanchable erythema (PrNBE), and deep tissue pressure injury  (DTPI). SEARCH QUESTION: What available bedside technologies enhance the early  detection of pressure injuries? METHODS: A systematic search of Medline, CINAHL,  Web of Science, and Cochrane databases was executed. Quantitative studies were  included that examined whether accessible technologies could indicate the  presence of PrBE, PrNBE, and DTPI. The quality of the research was evaluated  using the Johns Hopkins Nursing Evidence-Based Practice Rating Scale. FINDINGS:  We identified 18 eligible studies that represented a variety of technologies,  including ultrasound (n = 5), thermography (n = 7), subepidermal moisture (SEM)  measurement (n = 5), reflectance spectrometry (n = 2), and laser Doppler (n = 1).  The methodological rigor in study quality was variable. Subepidermal moisture  measurement provided the most consistent findings in the early detection of  pressure injury. CONCLUSIONS: Objective methods that provide accurate and timely  assessment of DTPIs augment early implementation of optimal prevention and  treatment measures. Evidence identified in this systematic review supports the  use of SEM measurement devices as effective tools for early pressure injury  detection. However, more research in the field of technology-enhanced, pressure  injury detection is needed to support the use of existing and emerging devices.

TI  - The subepidermal moisture scanner: the technology explained.
AU  - Gefen, Amit
AU  - Ross, Graham
T2  - Journal of wound care
AB  - The objective of this article is to explain the biophysical principles underlying the design of the subepidermal moisture (SEM) scanner, commercially known as the  'SEM scanner'. We also describe the mode of operation of the SEM scanner in  monitoring tissue health and detecting subtle abnormal changes in tissue  physiology in patients and anatomical sites at a risk of a pressure ulcer (PU:  also known as a pressure injury). The technology of the SEM scanner was approved  last year for sales in the US by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The SEM  scanner detects changes in fluid contents of human skin and subdermal tissues, to  a tissue depth of several millimetres, by measuring 'capacitance', an electrical  property of the locally examined tissue site to store electric charge. The  capacitance of tissues, called 'biocapacitance', is strongly affected by the  amount of fluid (water) in the tissue. When the first cells die in a forming PU,  inflammatory signalling causes the permeability of blood vessel walls to increase  and oedema to develop. Simply, the scanner detects the early appearance of  oedema, which is called 'micro-oedema.' Calculation of a 'SEM-delta' value, which  compares biocapacitance measurements, acquired across several tissue sites, some  of which are healthy and others where the PU may evolve, eliminates potential  effects of systemic changes in tissue fluid contents and provides a consistent  quantitative measure of the tissue health conditions at the monitored anatomical  site. Here, we describe SEM scanner technology, how it operates and has been  laboratory tested (in computer simulations, in silico) before commercial launch.  We explain why targeting the physical biomarker of oedema leads to the documented  success of the SEM scanner in the multiple published clinical trials, proving its  ability to early detect PUs that form under intact skin.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The biodegradable and biocompatible nature of pectin-based films is of particular interest in wound dressing applications, due to its non-toxicity,  pH-sensitivity and gelling activity. An approach to improve the mechanical  properties, the release profile of bioactive compounds as well as the performance  in wet environments of pectin-based films is mixing with other biopolymers.  OBJECTIVE: To prepare hydrocolloid films based on crosslinked pectin / starch  blend loaded with bioactive extracts from leaves of G. tinctoria and U. molinae  with controlled release of bioactive compounds and healing property. METHODS: The  hydrocolloid films were characterized by FTIR, SEM, and TGA-FTIR techniques and  their tensile properties, water uptake, and polyphenolic release profile in  aqueous media were evaluated. The dermal anti inflammatory activity of the  hydrocolloid films was assessed by the mouse ear inflammation test. The wound  healing property of the loaded hydrocolloid films was explored in a rat model and  in a clinical trial (sacrum pressure ulcer). RESULTS: The films showed an  adequate water-uptake capacity between 100-160%. The release of active compounds  from the hydrocolloid films followed the Korsmeyer-Peppas equation. The  mechanical properties of hydrocolloid films were not affected by the plant  extracts within the concentration range used. The incorporation of the bioactive  extracts in the polysaccharide films inhibited the topical edematous response by  about 50%. The topical application of the loaded hydrocolloid film on the  pressure ulcer is completely closed after 17 days without showing any adverse  reaction. CONCLUSION: A novel hydrocolloid matrix was produced from crosslinked  starch-pectin, which exhibited suitable chemical-physical properties to be used  as a carrier of plant extracts with wound healing properties.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of subepidermal moisture (SEM), a biomarker employed for early detection of pressure injuries  (PI), compared to the "Gold Standard" of clinical skin and tissue assessment  (STA), and to characterize the timing of SEM changes relative to the diagnosis of  a PI. This blinded, longitudinal, prospective clinical study enrolled 189  patients (n = 182 in intent-to-treat [ITT]) at acute and post-acute sites (9 USA,  3 UK). Data were collected from patients' heels and sacrums using a  biocapacitance measurement device beginning at admission and continuing for a  minimum of 6 days to: (a) the patient developing a PI, (b) discharge from care,  or (c) a maximum of 21 days. Standard of care clinical interventions prevailed,  uninterrupted. Principal investigators oversaw the study at each site. Blinded  Generalists gathered SEM data, and blinded Specialists diagnosed the presence or  absence of PIs. Of the ITT population, 26.4% developed a PI during the study;  66.7% classified as Stage 1 injuries, 23% deep tissue injuries, the remaining  being Stage 2 or Unstageable. Sensitivity was 87.5% (95% CI: 74.8%-95.3%) and  specificity was 32.9% (95% CI: 28.3%-37.8%). Area under the receiver operating  characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.6713 (95% CI 0.5969-0.7457, P < .001). SEM  changes were observed 4.7 (± 2.4 days) earlier than diagnosis of a PI via STA  alone. Latency between the SEM biomarker and later onset of a PI, in combination  with standard of care interventions administered to at-risk patients, may have  confounded specificity. Aggregate SEM sensitivity and specificity and 67.13% AUC  exceeded that of clinical judgment alone. While acknowledging specificity  limitations, these data suggest that SEM biocapacitance measures can complement  STAs, facilitate earlier identification of the risk of specific anatomies  developing PIs, and inform earlier anatomy-specific intervention decisions than  STAs alone. Future work should include cost-consequence analyses of SEM informed  interventions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The anterolateral ligament (ALL) has been identified as a structure on the lateral side of the knee, but debate exists regarding whether it is a  capsular thickening or a ligament. HYPOTHESIS: A detailed ultrastructural  characterization of the ALL and its ultrastructure collagen arrangement will  reveal it more closely resembles ligamentous tissue than joint capsule. STUDY  DESIGN: Descriptive laboratory study. METHODS: Eight paired knee samples from 4  fresh-frozen male cadavers were used for this study. Samples were harvested from  the ALL, the joint capsule, and the medial collateral ligament (MCL). All samples  were evaluated with light microscopy (LM), transmission electron microscopy  (TEM), and variable pressure scanning electron microscopy (VP-SEM). With LM, the  3 tissues were analyzed and their morphology described. With TEM, the  ultrastructure and collagen characteristics were quantified and compared among  specimens. Then, the 3-dimensional characteristics were compared with VP-SEM.  RESULTS: Ultrastructure analysis demonstrated similar morphology between the ALL  and MCL, with significant differences in these 2 structures as compared with the  joint capsule. On LM, the ALL and MCL were characterized by the presence of a  dense collagen fiber oriented in the longitudinal and transversal directions of  the fiber bundles, while the joint capsule was found to have a more disorganized  architecture. On TEM, the collagen fibers of the ALL and MCL demonstrated similar  ultrastructural morphology, with both having collagen fibers in parallel,  longitudinal alignment. A quantitative analysis was also performed, with the mean  (± SD) diameter of fibrils in the ALL and MCL being 80 ± 2.66 nm and 150 ± 3.35  nm, respectively (all P < .001). The VP-SEM highlighted that ALL and MCL  morphology demonstrated arrangements of fiber bundles that are densely packed and  organized, in contrast to the disorganized fibers of the joint capsule.  CONCLUSION: The ALL and MCL have comparable ultrastructures that are distinctly  different from the joint capsule, as visualized on LM, TEM, and VP-SEM. CLINICAL  RELEVANCE: The ALL should be considered a distinctive structure of the knee,  although strictly connected to the surrounding capsule.

AB  - BACKGROUND: An acute traumatic coagulopathy (ATC) is observed in about one third of severely traumatized patients. This early, specific, and endogenous disorder  is triggered by the association of trauma and hemorrhage. The early phase of this  condition is characterized by the expression of a bleeding phenotype leading to  hemorrhagic shock and the late phase by a prothrombotic profile leading to  multiple organ failure. The physiopathology of this phenomenon is still poorly  understood. Hypotheses of disseminated intravascular coagulation, activated  protein C-mediated fibrinolysis, fibrinogen consumption, and platelet functional  impairment were developed by previous authors and continue to be debated. The  objective of this study was to observe general hemostasis disorders in case of  ATC to confront these hypotheses. METHOD: Four groups of 15 rats were compared:  C, control; T, trauma; H, hemorrhage; and TH, trauma and hemorrhage. Blood  samples were drawn at baseline and 90 min. Thrombin generation tests, platelet  aggregometry, and standard hemostasis tests were performed. RESULTS: Significant  differences were observed between the baseline and TH groups for aPTT (17.9 ±  0.8 s vs 24.3 ± 1.4 s, p < 0.001, mean ± SEM), MAP (79.7 ± 1.3 mmHg vs 43.8 ±  1.3 mmHg, p < 0.001, mean ± SEM), and hemoglobin (16.5 ± 0.1 g/dL vs 14.1 ±  0.3 g/dL, p < 0.001, mean ± SEM), indicating the presence of an hemorrhagic shock  due to ATC. Compared to all other groups, coagulation factor activities were  decreased in the TH group, but endogenous thrombin potential was (paradoxically)  higher than in group C (312 ± 17 nM/min vs. 228 ± 23 nM/min; p = 0.016; mean ±  SEM). We also observed a subtle decrease in platelet count and function in case  of ATC and retrieved an inversed linear relationship between fibrinogen  concentration and aPTT (intercept, 26.53 ± 3.16; coefficient, - 3.40 ± 1.26;  adjusted R(2): 0.1878; p = 0.0123). CONCLUSIONS: The clinical-biological profile  that we observed, combining normal thrombin generation, fibrinogen depletion, and  a hemorrhagic phenotype, reinforced the hypothesis of activated protein C  mediated-fibrinolysis. The key role of fibrinogen, but not of the platelets, was  confirmed in this study. The paradoxical preservation of thrombin generation  suggests a protective mechanism mediated by rhabdomyolysis in case of major  trauma. Based on these results, we propose a new conception concerning the  pathophysiology of ATC.

AB  - Purpose/Aim: We used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate effects of intraocular pressure (IOP), race, and other factors on optic nerve (ON) traction  in adduction, a phenomenon proposed as neuropathic in open angle glaucoma  (OAG).Materials and Methods: Thirty-five patients with OAG (26 with maximal  untreated IOP ≤21 mmHg, 9 with IOP >21mmHg) and 48 controls underwent axial and  quasi-coronal MRI in central gaze and large (27-33°) abduction and adduction.  Some underwent MRI at smaller ductions (21-28°). Effects of presence vs. absence  of OAG; within OAG whether maximum IOP level was ≤21 mmHg vs. >21 mmHg; adduction  angle; race; age; and gender on ON path length and globe translation were  analyzed using generalized estimating equations to account for possible intereye  correlations of individual subjects.Results: Average visual field mean deviation  (±standard error of mean, SEM) was -8.2 ± 1.2 dB in OAG with normal IOP, and  -6.1 ± 1.4 in high IOP. In central gaze, ON path in OAG was significantly more  redundant than in controls but in both groups the ON became significantly and  almost equally straighter in small (~21°) or large (~27°) adduction than in  central gaze. With progressive adduction only, globes retracted in OAG (P  < 0.005) but not in controls; this was only weakly related to globe size and not  to IOP elevation. Globe retraction in adduction was significant only in OAG, and  in that group was significantly greater in Asian than white patients (P  < 0.02).Conclusions: Although ON tethering in adduction is normal, progressive  adduction is associated with abnormal globe retraction in OAG regardless of IOP  level. This phenomenon is more prominent in Asians who have OAG. Traction in  adduction may cause repetitive strain injury to the ON and peripapillary sclera,  thus contributing to the optic neuropathy of glaucoma independent of IOP.

AB  - The noninvasive SEM Scanner technology described herein assesses the fluid contents of human skin and subdermal tissues to a depth of several millimeters.  The device makes a direct steady-state measurement of the capacitance of its  sensor, which is affected by the equivalent dielectric constant of the material  (i.e. the layered tissue structures) that is within the electric field between  the sensor electrodes. Calculation of a "delta" value that compares measurements  from several sites, some of which will be healthy tissue, compensates for  systemic changes and provides a consistent measure of tissue health condition. We  describe the hardware, software and rigorous laboratory testing and computational  modeling of the principles of operation of the SEM Scanner, for the first time in  the literature. These studies revealed a detection depth of approximately 4 mm  for an electric potential of 0.3 V. The novel SEM Scanner provides the first  useful technological means to assess the health status of tissues below the  stratum corneum in patients who are at-risk for pressure injuries.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Numerous studies have evaluated the association between dietary factors and cardiovascular risk among patients with chronic disease. It is  worthwhile to assess these associations in a combination model rather than in an  isolated form. In the current study, we aimed to use structural equation modeling  (SEM) to assess the association of adherence to a healthy eating index (HEI)-2015  with socio-demographic factors, psychological characteristics, metabolic syndrome  (MetS) and other cardio-metabolic risk factors among obese individuals. METHODS:  This cross-sectional study was conducted among 188 healthy obese adults (96 males  and 92 females) aged 20-50 years in Tabriz. A validated semi-quantitative food  frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was used to record dietary intake and to estimate  HEI-2015. Anthropometric parameters, blood pressure and biochemical measurements  were evaluated according to standard protocols. Interrelationships among  socio-demographic parameters and HEI with cardio-metabolic risk factors were  analyzed using SEM. RESULTS: The results of SEM analysis revealed that HEI  mediated the association between age and several cardio-metabolic risk factors  including fat mass (FM), fat free mass (FFM), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and  high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (p < 0.05). Moreover, adherence to Dietary  Guidelines for Americans (DGA) appears to mediate association between gender and  waist circumference (B = -9.78), SBP (B = -4.83), triglyceride (B = -13.01) and  HDL (B = 4.31). HEI also mediated indirect negative effects of socioeconomic  status on FM (B = -0.56), FFM (B = -0.25), SBP (B = -0.55) and diastolic blood  pressure (DBP) (B = -0.3). Additionally, depression and age had indirect  unfavorable effects on some insulin resistance indices such as homeostasis model  assessment of insulin resistance (B = 0.07; p<0.05, for age) and quantitative  insulin sensitivity check index (p<0.05, for age and depression) via HEI. High  adherence to HEI was found to be inversely associated with MetS risk (p<0.05).  CONCLUSION: Adherence to HEI-2015 seems to mediate the effect of  socio-demographic parameters and mental health on cardio-metabolic risk factors  as well as MetS risk. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.

AB  - PURPOSE: The aim is to report a case of conjunctival tattooing with inadvertent injection of tattoo ink into the vitreous cavity and its consequences, the  scanning electron microscopy X-ray microanalysis of the ink components, and the  microscopic findings of the affected conjunctiva and vitreous. METHODS:  Descriptive case report. RESULTS: A 32-year-old man complained of ocular pain and  blurred vision after undergoing a subconjuctival red ink tattoo in his left eye.  Ophthalmologic examination revealed best corrected visual acuity of 20/80 and  intraocular pressure of 26 mmHg. Pain was elicited with eye movements. The bulbar  conjunctiva was colored intense red. In the anterior chamber, pigment granules  and filaments were suspended on the aqueous humor, and lens capsule was also  stained red. Ultrasonography showed high-density non-mobile echoes in the  conjunctiva; anterior chamber and vitreous cavity revealed high-density mobile  echoes corresponding to pigment particles. Conjunctival tattoo with inadvertent  globe penetration was the clinical diagnosis. The patient received medical and  surgical treatment. Histopathological examination of the conjunctiva showed red  pigment globular deposits within the stroma, and neutrophils and sparse  histiocytes with similar intracytoplasmic pigment granules were seen. No  granulomatous foreign body reaction was noticed. Vitreous material contained  pigment granules; no inflammatory cells were observed. Scanning electron  microscopy X-ray microanalysis of the tattoo red ink revealed significant signals  of iron, barium, and copper. CONCLUSION: Conjunctival tattoo is a new form of  body decoration gaining worldwide popularity. This procedure is performed by  untrained professionals causing severe ocular complications including blindness.  Safety regarding tattoo ink needs further study as the composition varies among  colors. Strict regulations on this matter should be considered.

T2  - Journal of wound care
AB  - OBJECTIVE: An in-practice evaluation of an sub-epidermal moisture (SEM) scanner, to detect non-visible pressure damage, allowing appropriate, targeted pressure  ulcer (PU) prevention interventions. METHOD: The evaluation included patients on  a single medical-surgical ward over a period of two months. RESULTS: The  evaluation included 35 patients. The outcomes of the evaluation suggest that the  SEM scanner provided objective evidence that both the interventions being  employed and the increase in repositioning and assessment prevented further  incipient skin damage. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the early detection of  non-visible tissue injury using the SEM scanner as an adjunct to the usual PU  risk assessment strategies can reduce PU incidence, leading to improved patient  outcomes and released productivity.

AB  - CONTEXT: Balance testing is a vital component in the evaluation and management of sport-related concussion. Few studies have examined the use of objective,  low-cost, force-plate balance systems and changes in balance after a competitive  season. OBJECTIVE: To examine the extent of preseason versus postseason static  balance changes using the Balance Tracking System (BTrackS) force plate in  college athletes. DESIGN: Pretest, posttest design. SETTING: Athletic training  facility. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 47 healthy, Division-I student-athletes (33  males and 14 females; age 18.4 [0.5] y, height 71.8 [10.8] cm, weight 85.6  [21.7] kg) participated in this study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Total center of  pressure path length was measured preseason and postseason using the BTrackS  force plate. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was conducted to examine preseason and  postseason changes. SEM and minimal detectable change were also calculated.  RESULTS: There was a significant difference in center of pressure path length  differed between preseason (24.6 [6.8] cm) and postseason (22.7 [5.4] cm)  intervals (P = .03), with an SEM of 3.8 cm and minimal detectable change of  10.5 cm. CONCLUSIONS: Significant improvements occurred for center of pressure  path length after a competitive season, when assessed using the BTrackS in a  sample of college athletes. Further research is warranted to determine the  effectiveness of the BTrackS as a reliable, low-cost alternative to force-plate  balance systems. In addition, clinicians may need to update baseline balance  assessments more frequently to account for improvements.

AU  - Peko Cohen, Lea

T2  - International wound journal
AB  - The majority of pressure ulcers (PUs) including deep tissue injuries (DTIs) are preventable, and even reversible if detected in their early phase. One of the  greatest barriers in PU prevention is that clinicians traditionally depended on  subjective and qualitative techniques, particularly routine visual skin  assessments that would only document existing, macroscopic PUs/DTIs, rather than  preventing them or detecting them at their microscopic phase. At the early phase  of cell damage, when a forming PU is still microscopic, there is a local increase  in extracellular fluid contents within affected tissues, which is called  sub-epidermal moisture (SEM). This new understanding has led to an emerging  technology, a SEM Scanner (BBI LLC, Bruin Biometrics) that has been designed to  effectively examine the health status of tissues, by measuring local changes in  the biophysical SEM marker. In the present work, the SEM Scanner was tested under  controlled laboratory conditions to experimentally determine its sensitivity and  precision in identifying small (1 mL) water content changes in phantoms of the  human heel and skull/face, which simulated common PU development scenarios. In  both phantom configurations, the locally increased water contents resulted in  consistent, statistically significant elevated SEM readings, which confirms that  the SEM Scanner is able to detect fluid content changes that are as small as  1 mL. In agreement with a simplified theoretical (mathematical) SEM model, which  was also developed here, changes in water contents had a consistent trend of  effect on SEM delta values, which increased with each 1 mL increment in  intra-tissue-substitute water contents.

AB  - The Bates-Jensen Wound Assessment Tool (BWAT) is used to assess wound healing in clinical practice. The purpose of this study was to evaluate BWAT use among  nursing home residents with pressure injury. Findings and reliability estimates  from the BWAT related to pressure injury characteristics (stage, anatomic  location) and natural history (resolved, persisted) among 142 ethnically and  racially diverse residents are reported. In this prospective 16-week study, 305  pressure injuries among 142 participants (34% prevalence) are described by stage,  anatomic location, and BWAT scores. Visual and subepidermal moisture assessments  were obtained from sacrum, buttock, ischial, and heel ulcers weekly. Participants  were 14% Asian, 28% Black, 18% Hispanic, 40% White with a mean age of  78 ± 14 years, and were 62% female; 80% functionally dependent (bed mobility  extensive/total assistance) and at risk (Braden Scale score 14 ± 2.7). The  reliability coefficient for BWAT score (all participants, all anatomic locations)  was high (r = 0.90; p < 0.0001; n = 1,161 observations). Weighted Kappas for  characteristics ranging from 0.46 (skin color surrounding wound) to 0.79  (undermining) were consistent for all participants. BWAT scores showed strongest  agreement coefficients for stage 4 pressure injury (r = 0.69), pressure injuries  among Asian and White ethnicity/racial groups (r = 0.89, and r = 0.91,  respectively), and sacrum anatomic location (r = 0.92) indicating scores are  better correlated to fair skin tones. Lower agreement coefficients were  demonstrated for stage 2 pressure injury (r = 0.38) and pressure injuries among  African American and Hispanic ethnicity/racial groups (r = 0.88 and 0.87,  respectively). BWAT scores were significantly different by pressure injury stage  (F = 496.7, df = 6, p < 0.001) and anatomic location (F = 33.76, df = 8,  p < 0.001). BWAT score correlated with pressure injury natural history (ulcer  resolved 18.4 ± 7.4, ulcer persisted 24.9 ± 10.0; F = 70.11, df = 2, p < 0.001),  but not with comorbidities. The BWAT provides reliable, objective data for  assessing pressure injury healing progress.

AB  - The aims of this randomised controlled study were to determine whether the application of silicone adhesive dressings with standard preventive care would  reduce the impairment of skin integrity and to evaluate the subepidermal moisture  (SEM) value in anatomical locations to predict impairment of skin integrity. Of  the 71 intensive care unit patients enrolled, 35 and 31 were randomly assigned to  the intervention and control groups, respectively. The SEM value was measured at  each site (the coccyx, sacrum, and both buttocks) repeatedly three times at every  dressing change. Collected data were analysed by multivariate linear regression,  and least square means analysis was used to compare the SEM value at the sites of  pressure injury (PI) and blanching erythema. There were fewer PIs (1 vs 9) and  incidences of blanching erythema (5 vs 6) in the intervention group than in the  control group (P = 0.006). The SEM value and difference of the SEM value from the  initial value was higher in the group with PIs than in the group without PIs  (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.001, respectively). There was a statistically significant  difference in the incidence of impaired skin integrity between the groups. The  SEM value may be an indicator for detecting impairment of skin integrity.

AB  - Although core stability (CS) training is largely used to enhance motor performance and prevent musculoskeletal injuries, the lack of methods to quantify  CS training intensity hinders the design of CS programs and the comparison and  generalization of their effects. The aim of this study was to analyze the  reliability of accelerometers integrated into smartphones to quantify the  intensity of several CS isometric exercises. Additionally, this study analyzed to  what extent the pelvic acceleration data represent the local stability of the  core structures or the whole-body postural control. Twenty-three male and female  physically-active individuals performed two testing-sessions spaced one week  apart, each consisting of two 6-second trials of five variations of frontal  bridge, back bridge, lateral bridge and bird-dog exercises. In order to assess  load intensity based on the postural control challenge of CS exercises, a  smartphone accelerometer and two force platforms were used to measure the mean  pelvic linear acceleration and the mean velocity of the centre of pressure  displacement, respectively. Reliability was assessed through the intra-class  correlation coefficient (ICC3,1) and the standard error of measurement (SEM). In  addition, Pearson coefficient was used to analyze the correlation between  parameters. The reliability analysis showed that most CS exercise variations  obtained moderate-to-high reliability scores for pelvic acceleration  (0.71<ICC<0.88; 13.23%≤SEM≤22.99%) and low-to-moderate reliability scores for  centre of pressure displacement (0.24<ICC<0.89; 9.88%≤SEM≤35.90%). Regarding the  correlation analysis, correlations between pelvic acceleration and centre of  pressure displacement were moderate-to-high (0.52≤r≤0.81). Based on these  results, smartphone accelerometers seem reliable devices to quantify isometric CS  exercise intensity, which is useful to identify the individuals' CS status and to  improve the dose-response characterization of CS programs.

TI  - Biomechanical Changes of Tympanic Membrane to Blast Waves.
AU  - Gan, Rong Z.
T2  - Advances in experimental medicine and biology
AB  - Eardrum or tympanic membrane (TM) is a multilayer soft tissue membrane located at the end of the ear canal to receive sound pressure and transport the sound into  the middle ear and cochlea. Rupture of the TM is one of the most frequent  injuries of the ear after blast exposure in military service members. The TM  mechanical property changes induced by blast waves also affect progressive  hearing loss in veterans. This chapter describes the biomechanical measurements  and modeling of blast wave transduction through the ear and the TM mechanical  property changes after blast exposure. The human TM rupture thresholds were  determined with a relationship to blast wave direction. It is found that the  sensitivity of TM stress change with respect to the pressure reaching on TM  surface characterizes the mechanical damage of the TM in relation to blast waves.  Mechanical properties of the human TM after exposure to blasts were measured  using acoustic loading and laser Doppler vibrometry with the inverse  problem-solving method. The complex modulus of the TM exposed to blast waves had  significant reduction compared to normal tissue. The SEM images of post-blast TM  showed obvious microstructural changes from the normal TM which indicate the  tissue damage caused by blast exposures. This chapter provides important data on  human TM damage and mechanical changes induced by blast overpressure waves.

T2  - Ostomy/wound management
AB  - Pressure ulcers (PUs) are detected by visual skin assessment (VSA). Evidence suggests ultrasound (US) and subepidermal moisture (SEM) scanner technology can  measure tissue damage before it is visible. PURPOSE: A pilot study was conducted  to evaluate consistency between SEM and US examinations of suspected deep tissue  injury (sDTI). METHOD: Using an observational, prospective cohort study design,  patients >55 years of age were recruited. VSA, SEM, and US assessments were  performed daily for a minimum of 3 and maximum of 10 consecutive days following  enrollment. US results were considered indicative of sDTI if hypoechoic lesions  were present. SEM readings were considered abnormal when ∆ ≥0.6 was noted for at  least 2 consecutive days. Boolean analysis was utilized to systematically  determine consistency between US and SEM where sDTI was the clinical judgment.  RESULTS: Among the 15 participants (10 women, mean age 74 ± 10.9 years), there  was consistent agreement between SEM and US when sDTIs existed. For 1 patient who  developed a heel sDTI during the study, SEM readings were abnormal 2 days before  VSA indicated tissue damage and 3 days before the appearance of a hypoechoic  lesion in the US. CONCLUSION: US and SEM results were similar, and in an evolving  sDTI case, SEM detected a lesion earlier than US.

AB  - Detection of subcutaneous tissue damage before it is visible can trigger early intervention and decrease hospital-acquired pressure ulcer (HAPU) rates. The  objective of this two-phase study was to evaluate the clinical utility of the  Sub-Epidermal Moisture (SEM) Scanner (Bruin Biometrics (BBI), LLC), a hand-held  device that assesses increases in interstitial fluid or subepidermal moisture,  indicating early tissue damage. Phase 1: Patients were provided standard-of-care  risk assessment and interventions and were scanned with the SEM Scanner, but the  resulting SEM scores were not used to determine interventions. This gave a  baseline pressure ulcer incidence rate. Phase 2: This phase is the same as Phase  1 except the resulting SEM scores were used in conjunction with risk assessment  scores to determine appropriate interventions and care planning. In Phase 1, 12  of the 89 subjects or 13.5% developed visible pressure ulcers-4 Stage I's, 6  Stage II's, 1 Stage III, and 1 deep tissue injury. In Phase 2, 2 of the 195  subjects or 1.0% developed visible pressure ulcers-1 Stage I and 1 Stage II.  Patients in Phase 2 were more incontinent, less mobile, and had longer lengths of  stay than those in Phase 1. Use of the Scanner resulted in a 93% decrease in  HAPU. No deep injuries developed in Phase 2.

T2  - Journal of tissue viability
AB  - AIM: To explore the relationship between nurses' visual assessment of early pressure ulceration and assessment using sub epidermal moisture measurement (a  measure of skin and tissue water). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A descriptive  prospective observational study design was employed. Following ethical approval  and written informed consent, data were collected daily, for four weeks, from at  risk patients within an acute care facility in Ireland. Data included nurses  documented assessment of the patient's skin condition and researcher led sub  epidermal moisture measurement, over the sacrum and both heels. RESULTS: A total  of 47 patients were included, 38.3% (n = 18) were male and 61.5% (n = 29) were  female, with a mean age of 74.7 years. Nineteen patients (40%) developed 21 Stage  1 pressure ulcers and all of these had sustained elevated sub epidermal moisture  (SEM) levels before visual signs of damage became evident indicating 100%  sensitivity of SEM readings in predicting pressure ulceration. Specificity was  83% with the majority of false positives having insufficient follow-up time.  Furthermore a medium correlation between nurses' visual skin assessment (the  current gold standard in pressure ulcer detection) and SEM findings (r = .47;  p = 0.001) was identified. The mean number of days for nurses to detect this  damage was 5.5 (±2,5; max 11, min 2), whereas the mean number of days that it  took SEM measurement to detect damage was 1.5 (±1.4; max 7, min 1). SEM  measurement identified early damage, on average, 4 days sooner than nurses'  assessment. CONCLUSION: Given that pressure ulcers develop from within the deeper  tissues, knowing that early pressure ulcer damage is present can facilitate  heightening of prevention strategies to avoid extension. This is of importance in  clinical practice as the earlier that pressure ulcers can be detected; the  earlier interventions can be implemented to prevent further extension, avoiding  their associated morbidity and mortality.

AB  - AIM: The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship of subepidermal moisture and early stage pressure injury by visual skin assessment in elderly  Korean. METHODS: Twenty-nine elderly participated at a particular nursing home.  Data were collected for 12 weeks by one wound care nurse. Visual skin assessment  and subepidermal moisture value were measured at both buttocks, both ischia, both  trochanters, sacrum, and coccyx of each subject once a week. RESULTS:  Subepidermal moisture value of stage 1 pressure injury was significantly higher  than that of no injury and blanching erythema. After adjustment with covariates,  odds ratios of blanching erythema to normal skin and stage 1 pressure injury to  blanching erythema/normal skin were statistically significant (p < 0.05). Odds  ratio of blanching erythema to normal skin was 1.003 (p = .047) by 1-week prior  subepidermal moisture value, and that of concurrent subepidermal moisture value  was 1.004 (p = .011). Odds ratio of stage 1 pressure injury to normal  skin/blanching erythema was 1.003 (p = .005) by 1-week prior subepidermal  moisture value, and that for concurrent subepidermal moisture value was 1.007  (p = .030). Subepidermal moisture was associated with concurrent and future (1  week later) skin damage at both trochanters. CONCLUSION: Subepidermal moisture  would be used to predict early skin damage in clinical nursing field for the  effective pressure injury prevention.

T2  - Journal of wound care
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between sub-epidermal moisture (SEM) and visual skin assessment (VSA) in pressure ulcers (PU) patients with jaundice  in Korea. METHOD: This is a longitudinal observational study. Data was collected  by a wound care nurse, at a tertiary hospital, for six weeks beginning in June  2013. Once a week for the six weeks, the nurse assessed VSA and measured SEM, for  each subject, on seven anatomical sites (both buttocks, both ischial  tuberosities, both trochanters, and the sacral coccyx), using a NOVA Petite  dermal phase meter for SEM. The measurements ranged from 0 to 999, and higher SEM  indicates higher water content in the tissue. RESULTS: There were 22 adults  participated in the study. The SEMs in category I PU were significantly higher  than those in patients who had no injury, or blanching erythema. The SEM  difference between category I PU and either blanching erythema or no injury was  more than 60 points at the sacral coccyx, and the difference between blanching  erythema and no PU was more than 100 points at the trochanters. After the  covariates were adjusted for, the odds ratios (ORs) for blanching erythema were  statistically significant. The ORs for blanching erythema versus normal skin was  1.016 higher than the concurrent SEMs. Also, The ORs of 1-point concurrent SEMs  for blanching erythema versus normal skin at Sacral coccyx, right and left  ischial tuberosity and left trochanter were 1.015, 1.128, 1.137 and 1.051  respectively (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: SEM was associated with concurrent early skin  damage, specifically blanching erythema with jaundice. Therefore, SEM may be used  to predict early skin damage in patients with jaundice in clinical nursing for  effective PU prevention and management.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyse the enamel damage caused by ultrasonic scaling of teeth with various enamel conditions that are difficult to  identify by visual inspection, such as enamel cracks, early caries and resin  restorations. METHODS: In total, 120 tooth surfaces were divided into 4  experimental groups using a quantitative light-induced fluorescence-digital  system: sound enamel group, enamel cracks group, early caries group and resin  restoration group. A skilled dental hygienist performed ultrasonic scaling under  a standardized set of conditions: a ≤ 15° angle between the scaler tip and tooth  surface and 40-80 g of lateral pressure at the rate of 12 times/10 s. Following  scaling, the depth of enamel damage was measured using a surface profilometer and  observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). RESULTS: The damage depth was  the greatest in the enamel cracks group (37.63 ± 34.42 μm), followed by the early  caries group (26.81 ± 8.67 μm), resin restoration group (19.63 ± 6.73 μm) and the  sound enamel group (17.00 ± 5.66 μm). The damage depth was significantly deeper  in the enamel cracks and early caries groups than in the sound enamel group  (P < .05). SEM clearly revealed enamel loss in the enamel cracks, early caries  and resin restoration groups. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that  ultrasonic scaling can cause further damage to teeth with enamel cracks, early  caries and resin restorations. Therefore, accurate identification of tooth  conditions and calculus before the initiation of ultrasonic scaling is necessary  to minimize damage.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although small series have suggested that younger age is associated with less favorable outcome after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI),  confounders and biases have limited our understanding of this relationship. We  hypothesized that there would be an association between age and mortality in  children within an ongoing observational, cohort study. METHODS: The first 200  subjects from the Approaches and Decisions for Acute Pediatric TBI trial were  eligible for this analysis (inclusion criteria: severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale  [GCS] score ≤ 8], age 18 years, and intracranial pressure (ICP) monitor placed;  exclusion: pregnancy). Children with suspected abusive head trauma (AHT) were  excluded to avoid bias related to the association between AHT and mortality.  Demographics, and prehospital and resuscitation events were collected/analyzed,  and children were stratified based on age at time of injury (< 5, 5-< 11,  11-18 years) and presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Analyses  of variance were used to test the equality of the means across the group for  continuous variable, and Chi-square tests were used to compare percentages for  discrete variables (post hoc comparisons were made using t test and Bonferroni  corrections, as needed). Kaplan-Meier curves were generated for each age subgroup  describing the time of death, and log-rank was used to compare the curves. Cox  proportional hazards regression models were used to assess the effect of age on  time to death while controlling for covariates. RESULTS: In the final cohort  (n = 155, 45 excluded for AHT), overall age was 9.2 years ± 0.4 and GCS was  5.3 ± 0.1. Mortality was similar between strata (14.0, 20.0, 20.9%, respectively,  p = 0.58). Motor vehicle accidents were the most common mechanism across all  strata, while falls tended to be more common in the youngest stratum (p = 0.08).  The youngest stratum demonstrated increased incidence of spontaneous hypothermia  at presentation and decreased hemoglobin concentrations and coagulopathies, while  the oldest demonstrated lower platelet counts. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to  previous reports, we failed to detect mortality differences across age strata in  children with severe TBI. We have discerned novel associations between age and  various markers of injury-unrelated to AHT-that may lead to testable hypotheses  in the future.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We endeavored to develop clinically translatable nonhuman primate (NHP) models of severe polytraumatic hemorrhagic shock. METHODS: NHPs were  randomized into five severe pressure-targeted hemorrhagic shock  (PTHS) ± additional injuries scenarios: 30-min PTHS (PTHS-30), 60-min PTHS  (PTHS-60), PTHS-60 + soft tissue injury (PTHS-60+ST), PTHS-60+ST + femur fracture  (PTHS-60+ST+FF), and decompensated PTHS+ST+FF (PTHS-D). Physiologic parameters  were recorded and blood samples collected at five time points with animal  observation through T = 24 h. Results presented as mean ± SEM; statistics: log  transformation followed by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni multiple comparisons,  Wilcoxon nonparametric test for comparisons, and the Friedmans' one-way ANOVA;  significance: P < 0.05. RESULTS: Percent blood loss was 40% ± 2, 59% ± 3,  52% ± 3, 49% ± 2, and 54% ± 2 for PTHS-30, PTHS-60, PTHS-60+ST, PTHS-60+ST+FF,  and PTHS-D, respectively. All animals survived to T = 24 h except one in each of  the PTHS-60 and PTHS-60+ST+FF groups and seven in the PTHS-D group. Physiologic,  coagulation, and inflammatory parameters demonstrated increasing derangements  with increasing model severity. CONCLUSION: NHPs exhibit a high degree of  resilience to hemorrhagic shock and polytrauma as evidenced by moderate  perturbations in metabolic, coagulation, and immunologic outcomes with up to  60 min of profound hypotension regardless of injury pattern. Extending the  duration of PTHS to the point of decompensation in combination with polytraumatic  injury, evoked derangements consistent with those observed in severely injured  trauma patients which would require ICU care. Thus, we have successfully  established a clinically translatable NHP trauma model for use in testing  therapeutic interventions to trauma.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Children with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) exhibit behavioral, cognitive, and autonomic deficits, suggestive of neural injury. We  assessed whether the tissue alterations resulted from acute or chronic processes,  and whether alterations correlated with disease severity. METHODS: Brain tissue  integrity was examined with mean diffusivity (MD) (3.0 T scanner) in 20  nonsnoring controls (mean age ± SEM, 12.2 ± 0.6 years; 10 males) and 18 children  with SDB (12.3 ± 0.7 years; 11 males). Sleep, cognitive, and behavioral measures  were compared between groups following overnight polysomnography using Student's  t tests. Whole-brain MD maps were realigned and averaged, normalized, smoothed,  and compared between groups using ANCOVA (covariates: age, gender, and  socioeconomic status). Partial correlations were calculated between whole-brain  smoothed MD maps and obstructive apnea-hypopnea indices (OAHIs). RESULTS: Age,  gender, and sleep variables did not differ between groups. The SDB group showed  higher OAHIs, body mass indices, and systolic blood pressure. Significantly  reduced MD values (acute changes) appeared in the hippocampus, insula, thalamus,  temporal and occipital cortices, and cerebellum, but were increased (chronic  damage) in the frontal and prefrontal cortices in the SDB group over controls.  Both positive and negative correlations appeared with extent of tissue changes  and disease severity. Externalizing and Total Problem Behaviors were  significantly higher in children with SDB. Verbal, performance, and total IQ  scores trended lower, and behavioral scores trended higher. CONCLUSIONS:  Pediatric SDB is accompanied by predominantly acute brain changes in areas that  regulate autonomic, cognitive, and mood functions, and chronic changes in frontal  cortices essential for behavioral control. Interventions need to be keyed to  address acute vs chronic injury.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hemorrhage is the leading cause of preventable death in traumatically injured civilian and military populations. Prehospital resuscitation largely  relies on crystalloid and colloid intravascular expansion, as whole blood and  component blood therapy are logistically arduous. In this experiment, we  evaluated the bookends of Tactical Combat Casualty Care Guidelines  recommendations of prehospital resuscitation with Hextend and whole blood in a  controlled hemorrhagic shock model within non-human primates, as means of a  multifunctional resuscitative fluid development. METHODS: In the nonhuman  primate, a multiple injuries model was used, consisting of a musculoskeletal  injury (femur fracture), soft tissue injury (15-cm laparotomy), and controlled  hemorrhage to a mean arterial pressure of 20 mm Hg, demarcating the beginning of  the shock period. Animals were randomized to prehospital interventions of whole  blood or Hextend at T = 0 minutes, and at T = 90 minutes definitive surgical  interventions and balanced sanguineous damage control resuscitation could be  implemented. All animals were euthanized at T = 480 minutes. Data are expressed  as mean ± SEM; significance, p < 0.05. RESULTS: No significant differences in  survival (83% vs. 100%; p = 0.3), tissue perfusion (EtCO2 and StO2) or endpoints  of resuscitation (base deficit, lactate, pH) between Hextend and whole blood were  identified. Second, whole blood compared with Hextend demonstrated significantly  earlier normalization of clot formation time, maximal clot firmness, and α angle.  CONCLUSION: A future multifunctional resuscitative fluid including an  asanguineous, oncotic, non-oxygen-carrying component to facilitate intravascular  volume expansion, and a component with synthetic coagulation factors and  fibrinogen to deter coagulopathy may show equivalence to whole blood. LEVEL OF  EVIDENCE: N/A: Study type: translational animal model.

AB  - We examined subepidermal moisture (SEM) and visual skin assessment of heel pressure injury (PrI) among 417 nursing home residents in 19 facilities over  16 weeks. Participants were older (mean age 77 years), 58% were female, over half  were ethnic minorities (29% African American, 12% Asian American, 21% Hispanic),  and at risk for PrI (mean Braden Scale Risk score = 15.6). Blinded concurrent  visual assessments and SEM measurements were obtained at heels weekly. Visual  skin damage was categorised as normal, erythema, stage 1 PrI, deep tissue injury  (DTI) or stage 2 or greater PrI. PrI incidence was 76%. Off-loading occurred with  pillows (76% of residents) rather than heel boots (21%) and often for those with  DTI (91%). Subepidermal moisture was measured with a device where higher readings  indicate greater moisture (range: 0-70 tissue dielectric constant), with normal  skin values significantly different from values in the presence of skin damage.  Subepidermal moisture was associated with concurrent damage and damage 1 week  later in generalised multinomial logistic models adjusting for age, diabetes and  function. Subepidermal moisture detected DTI and differentiated those that  resolved, remained and deteriorated over 16 weeks. Subepidermal moisture may be  an objective method for detecting PrI.

T2  - Current eye research
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of the current study was to assess the potential involvement of acid-sensing ion channel 1 (ASIC1) in retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death and  investigate the neuroprotective effects of inhibitors of ASICs in promoting RGC  survival following optic nerve crush (ONC). RESULTS: ASIC1 protein was  significantly increased in optic nerve extracts at day 7 following ONC in rats.  Activated calpain-1 increased at 2 and 7 days following ONC as evidenced by  increased degradation of α-fodrin, known substrate of calpain. Glial fibrillary  acidic protein levels increased significantly at 2 and 7 days post-injury. By  contrast, glutamine synthetase increased at 2 days while decreased at 7 days. The  inhibition of ASICs with amiloride and psalmotoxin-1 significantly increased RGC  survival in rats following ONC (p < 0.05, one-way ANOVA). The mean number of  surviving RGCs in rats (n = 6) treated with amiloride (100 µM) following ONC was  1477 ± 98 cells/mm(2) compared with ONC (1126 ± 101 cells/mm(2)), where  psalmotoxin-1 (1 μM) treated rats (n = 6) and subjected to ONC had 1441 ± 63  RGCs/mm(2) compared with ONC (1065 ± 76 RGCs/mm(2)). Average number of RGCs in  control rats (n = 12) was 2092 ± 46 cells/mm(2). Blocking of ASICs also  significantly increased RGC survival from ischemic-like insult from 473 ± 80 to  842 ± 49 RGCs/mm(2) (for psalmotoxin-1) and from 628 ± 53 RGCs/mm(2) to 890 ± 55  RGCs/mm(2) (for amiloride) with p ≤ 0.05, using one-way ANOVA. Acidification (a  known activator of ASIC1) increased intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](i)) in rat  primary RGCs, which was statistically blocked by pretreatment with 100 nM  psalmotoxin-1. CONCLUSIONS: ASIC1 up-regulation-induced influx of extracellular  calcium may be responsible for activation of calcium-sensitive calpain-1 in the  retina. Calpain-1 induced degradation of α-fodrin and leads to morphological  changes and eventually neuronal death. Therefore, blockers of ASIC1 can be used  as potential therapeutics in the treatment of optic nerve degeneration.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Process indicators have been widely used to monitor the way trauma care is provided. We aimed to analyze whether data from a hospital's severe  trauma register could facilitate the evaluation of aspects of the initial  management of severe injuries. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Observational, retrospective  population-based study. A working group of experts selected a set of trauma care  process indicators relevant to some aspects of initial care, diagnosis, and  treatment of severely injured patients. Four of the indicators referred to  prehospital care and 5 to hospital care. We calculated the observed and expected  compliance rates for all the indicators. RESULTS: A total of 1526 cases (44.4%)  were analyzed for 2013; 1908 (55.6%) were analyzed for 2014. We were able to  evaluate 3 of the 4 prehospital process indicators: endotracheal intubation in  patients with a score of 􀀀 8 on the Glasgow coma scale (GCS) (84% compliance),  venous access established before hospital arrival (83.4%), and placement of a  neck collar to immobilize the cervical spine (72.7%). Compliance for the  hospital-phase indicators were as follows: performance of a computed tomography  scan of the head within 60 minutes in cases with a GCS of 􀀀 13 (5.3% compliance,  craniotomy in candidate patients within 2 hours of diagnosis (65%), diagnostic  examination for abdominal injuries within 60 minutes in patients with systolic  blood pressure 􀀀 90 mm Hg (89.3%), and therapeutic laparotomy or angiography  within 4 hours of abdominal injury in candidate patients with systolic blood  pressure 􀀀 90 mm Hg (51.7%). Compliance was 69.9% for the last process indicator:  surgical treatment of open fractures within 8 hours of an accident. CONCLUSION:  Our findings show that a hospital trauma register provides data about care  process indicators that can allow us to monitor the quality of care of severely  injured patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Essential hypertension is mainly caused by endothelial dysfunction which results from nitric oxide (NO) deficiency. The present study was design to  evaluate the protective effect of Bidens pilosa ethylene acetate extract (Bp) on  L-NAME induced hypertension and oxidative stress in rats. METHODS: Male Wistar  rats were used to induce hypertension by the administration of L-NAME (a  non-pecific nitric oxide inhibitor) (50 mg/kg/day). The others groups were  receiving concomitantly L-NAME plus Bp extract (75 and 150 mg/kg/day) or losartan  (25 mg/kg/day). All the treatments were given orally for 4 weeks. At the end of  the treatment, the hemodynamic parameters were recorded using the direct  cannulation method. The effects of the extract on lipid profile, kidney and liver  functions as well as oxidative stress markers were evaluated by colorimetric  method. Results were expressed as the mean ± SEM. The difference between the  groups was compared using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the  Duncan's post hoc test. RESULTS: Animals receiving L-NAME presented high blood  pressure, normal heart rate and lipid profile as well as NO depletion, liver and  kidney injuries and oxidative stress. The concomitant treatment with L-NAME and  Bp or losartan succeeded to prevent the raised of blood pressure and all the  other injuries without affecting the heart rate. CONCLUSION: These results  confirm the antihypertensive effects of Bidens pilosa and highlight its  protective properties in L-NAME model of hypertension in rat, probably due to the  presence of Quercetin 3,3 '-dimethyl ether 7-0-β-D-glucopyranoside.

AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the efficacy of photochemical-induced tissue cross-linking (PCL), utilizing Rose Bengal (RB) and 532 nm green light irradiation (RB-PCL),  with standard sutures for closure of penetrating corneal incision in porcine  cadaver eyes. METHODS: A full-thickness penetrating incision, 3 mm in length  parallel to the limbus and perpendicular to the corneal surface, was made in the  enucleated porcine cornea. Photochemical cross-linking was performed with  tropical RB application and irradiation of 532 nm green light (0.6 W/cm(2)) for  200, 250, and 300 seconds at laser fluences of 120, 150, and 180 J/cm(2),  respectively, which was compared with the standard 10-0 nylon suture group.  Following treatment, intraocular pressure to the point where wound leakage  occurred (IOP(L)) was measured. Corneal central thickness and surface temperature  before and after PCL treatment were recorded. Optical coherence tomography (OCT)  and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were utilized to evaluate wound closure.  RESULTS: The mean corneal central thickness was increased from 812.0 ± 47.0 to  838.0 ± 45.6 µm after the incision as a result of cornea aqueous humor  infiltration. RB penetrated approximately 140 μm into the porcine corneal stroma.  The mean IOP(L) for untreated blank group after incision was 4.27 ± 0.36 mmHg.  Increased laser fluences produced increased IOP(L) of 27.02 ± 3.01 (PCL(120)),  31.60 ± 3.67 (PCL(150)) and 36.73 ± 3.25 mmHg (PCL(180)), which were  statistically different from the control intact group. The mean IOP(L) in the  sutured cornea was 57.30 ± 4.59 mmHg. The average surface temperature difference  before and after PCL treatment was 2.03 ± 0.45-2.47 ± 0.79°C. OCT demonstrated  not only complete but also improved closure in comparison with disorganized  collagen fibers after conventional suturing, which is further confirmed by SEM.  CONCLUSIONS: Complete and clinically relevant seal of full-thickness porcine  corneal incision was achieved using PCL method ex vivo, which provides potential  application of this technique in ocular wound closure.

AB  - The rupture of tympanic membrane (TM) has long been viewed as an indicator of blast injury, especially for hearing loss. However, little is known about damage  to the TM caused by blast with pressure lower than the rupture threshold. In this  paper, we present our study on the effect of blast overpressure on the static  mechanical properties of TM. Chinchilla was used as the animal model and exposed  to multiple blasts with pressures lower than the rupture threshold of the TM.  Using a micro-fringe projection method, we observed the alteration of the static  mechanical properties of post-blast chinchilla's TMs as compared to those of  control TMs. Specifically, after exposing to multiple blasts, the Young's modulus  of chinchilla TM decreased by ∼53% while the ultimate failure pressure decreased  by ∼33%. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images show the damage formation in  the post-blast TM as compared with its control counterpart.

AB  - PURPOSE: Covered stents have been demonstrated to reduce restenosis; however, the membrane's limited biocompatibility can still lead to thrombus formation. To  obtain optimal surface hemocompatibility, endothelialization of the luminal  surface has been proposed. However, the effect of delivery procedures, such as  crimping and balloon dilatation, on the endothelial layer has not been  quantified. This study investigated the impact of such procedures on  endothelialized covered stents in vitro. METHODS: Using an injection molding  technique, bare metal stents were covered with fibrin subsequently,  endothelialized and conditioned in a bioreactor under arterial pressure  (80-120 mmHg) and shear stress (1 Pa). For each set of experiments, three covered  stents were prepared, one being subjected to crimping alone, one to crimping  followed by balloon dilatation and one serving as control. The experiment was  repeated three times. The endothelial coverage was quantified by scanning  electron microscopy (SEM). The functionality of the endothelium after exposure to  platelet-rich plasma was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and SEM. RESULTS: The  mean endothelial coverage of control, crimped, crimped and balloon-dilated stents  was 87.6, 80.1 and 52.1%, respectively, indicating that endothelial cells  detached significantly not after crimping (P = 0.465) but following balloon  dilatation (P < 0.001). The cells present on the stent's surface, either after  crimping or crimping followed by balloon dilatation, expressed eNOS and CD31 and  exhibited no platelet adhesion. CONCLUSION: The simulated delivery procedure  resulted in the retention of viable cells on more than half of the luminal  surface. The main damage to the layer occurred during balloon dilatation.

AB  - We examined the relationship between subepidermal moisture measured using surface electrical capacitance and visual skin assessment of pressure ulcers at the trunk  location (sacral, ischial tuberosities) in 417 nursing home residents residing in  19 facilities. Participants were on average older (mean age of 77 years), 58%  were female, over half were ethnic minorities (29% African American, 12% Asian  American, and 21% Hispanic), and at risk for pressure ulcers (mean score for  Braden Scale for Predicting Pressure Ulcer Risk of 15.6). Concurrent visual  assessments and subepidermal moisture were obtained at the sacrum and right and  left ischium weekly for 16 weeks. Visual assessment was categorized as normal,  erythema, stage 1 pressure ulcer, Deep Tissue Injury or stage 2+ pressure ulcer  using the National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel 2009 classification system.  Incidence of any skin damage was 52%. Subepidermal moisture was measured with a  dermal phase meter where higher readings indicate greater moisture (range: 0-70  tissue dielectric constant), with values increasing significantly with the  presence of skin damage. Elevated subepidermal moisture values co-occurred with  concurrent skin damage in generalized multinomial logistic models (to control for  repeated observations) at the sacrum, adjusting for age and risk. Higher  subepidermal moisture values were associated with visual damage 1 week later  using similar models. Threshold values for subepidermal moisture were compared to  visual ratings to predict skin damage 1 week later. Subepidermal moisture of 39  tissue dielectric constant units predicted 41% of future skin damage while visual  ratings predicted 27%. Thus, this method of detecting early skin damage holds  promise for clinicians, especially as it is objective and equally valid for all  groups of patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: to evaluate the efficacy of the treatment with hyperbaric oxygen therapy or with topical and intralesional heparin in an animal model of degloving  lesions. METHODS: we conducted an experimental study with adult, male Wistar rats  submitted to degloving of the left hind limb and divided into four groups  according to the treatment: Group 1 (control) - without treatment; Group 2  (Heparin) - intralesional application at the time of surgery and topically, in  the postoperative period, with heparin spray 10,000IU/mL; Group 3 (hyperbaric  oxygenation) - daily sessions of 30 minutes in a hyperbaric chamber with 100%  oxygen and 2 ATA pressure; Group 4 (positive control) - administration of a  single dose of 45 mg/kg of intraperitoneal allopurinol. On the seventh day, we  killed the animals, removed the cutaneous flaps and measured the total and  necrotic areas, as well as computed the percentage of necrotic area. RESULTS: the  mean percentage of necrosis in the control group was 56.03%; in the positive  control group it was 51.36% (p<0.45); in the heparin group, 42.10% (p<0.07); and  in the hyperbaric oxygen therapy group, 31.58% (p<0.01) . CONCLUSION: both  hyperbaric oxygen and heparin therapies were effective in reducing the percentage  of necrosis in the model studied, although only the hyperbaric oxygenation showed  statistical significance. OBJETIVOS: avaliar a eficácia do tratamento com  oxigenoterapia hiperbárica ou com heparina tópica e intralesional em modelo  animal de desluvamentos. MÉTODOS: estudo experimental, com ratos adultos machos  Wistar, submetidos a desluvamento do membro posterior esquerdo e divididos em  quatro grupos, de acordo com o tratamento: Grupo 1 (controle) - sem tratamento;  Grupo 2 (Heparina) - aplicação intralesional no momento da cirurgia e tópica, no  pós operatório, com spray de heparina 10.000UI/mL; Grupo 3 (oxigenação  hiperbárica) - sessões diárias de 30 minutos em câmara hiperbárica com 100% de  oxigênio e 2 ATA de pressão; Grupo 4 (controle positivo) - administração de dose  única de 45mg/kg de alopurionol intraperitoneal. No sétimo dia os animais foram  mortos e os retalhos cutâneos foram retirados e realizadas medidas das áreas  total e necrótica, bem como cálculo da porcentagem da área de necrose.  RESULTADOS: a média da porcentagem de necrose do grupo controle foi 56,03%; no  grupo controle positivo, 51,36% (p≤0,45); no grupo da heparina, 42,10% (p≤0,07) e  no grupo da oxigenoterapia hiperbárica, 31,58% (p≤0,01). CONCLUSÃO: tanto a  oxigenoterapia hiperbárica quanto a terapia com heparina mostraram-se eficazes na  redução do percentual de necrose no modelo estudado, embora neste trabalho apenas  a oxigenação hiperbárica tenha demonstrado significância estatística.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our aims were to: establish the clinical significance of ultrasound, thermography, photography and subepidermal moisture (SEM) measurement; determine  the accuracy of ultrasound, thermography, photography and SEM measurement in  detecting skin/tissue damage; determine the relative accuracy of one of these  assessment methods over another; make recommendations for practice pertaining to  assessment of early skin/tissue damage. METHOD: The following databases, Cochrane  Wounds Group Specialised Register, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled  Trials, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, Elsevier version, EBSCO CINAHL,  ClinicalTrials.gov , WHO International Clinical Trials Registry (ICTR) and The EU  Clinical Trials Register were searched for terms including; thermography,  ultrasound, subepidermal moisture, photograph and pressure ulcer. RESULTS: We  identified four SEM, one thermography and five ultrasound studies for inclusion  in this review. Data analysis indicated that photography was not a method which  allowed for the early prediction of PU presence. SEM values increased with  increasing tissue damage, with the sacrum and the heels being the most common  anatomical locations for the development of erythema and stage I PUs.  Thermography identified temperature changes in tissues and skin that may give an  indication of early PU development; however the data were not sufficiently  robust. Ultrasound detected pockets of fluid/oedema at different levels of the  skin that were comparable with tissue damage. Thus, SEM and ultrasound were the  best methods for allowing a more accurate assessment of early skin/tissue damage.  Using the EBL Critical Appraisal Tool the overall validities of the studies  varied between 33.3-55.6%, meaning that there is potential for bias within all  the included studies. All of the studies were situated at level IV, V and VII of  the evidence pyramid. Although the methodological quality of the studies warrants  consideration, these studies showed the potential that SEM and ultrasound have in  early PU detection. CONCLUSION: SEM and ultrasound are promising in the detection  and prediction of early tissue damage and PU presence. However, these methods  should be further studied to clarify their potential for use more widely in PU  prevention strategies.

AB  - Recent findings on cephalopods in laboratory conditions showed that exposure to artificial noise had a direct consequence on the statocyst, sensory organs, which  are responsible for their equilibrium and movements in the water column. The  question remained about the contribution of the consequent near-field particle  motion influence from the tank walls, to the triggering of the trauma. Offshore  noise controlled exposure experiments (CEE) on common cuttlefish (Sepia  officinalis), were conducted at three different depths and distances from the  source and particle motion and sound pressure measurements were performed at each  location. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed injuries in statocysts,  which severity was quantified and found to be proportional to the distance to the  transducer. These findings are the first evidence of cephalopods sensitivity to  anthropogenic noise sources in their natural habitat. From the measured received  power spectrum of the sweep, it was possible to determine that the animals were  exposed at levels ranging from 139 to 142 dB re 1 μPa(2) and from 139 to 141 dB  re 1 μPa(2), at 1/3 octave bands centred at 315 Hz and 400 Hz, respectively.  These results could therefore be considered a coherent threshold estimation of  noise levels that can trigger acoustic trauma in cephalopods.

AB  - The Braden Scale is the most widely used pressure ulcer risk assessment system in the world. To investigate its construct validity using structural equation  modeling (SEM), a secondary analysis of retrospective data of patients admitted  to an acute care facility was conducted using the records of 2588 patients who  were at risk for pressure ulcers and admitted between January 2013 and December  2013. Data were extracted to an Excel sheet and analyzed, including demographic  characteristics (ie, patients age, gender, weight, and disease spectrum), as well  as total Braden scores and subscale scores. The SEM was set according to  modification indices suggestion. The original Braden Scale model was supported by  χ2(9) = 22.854, CFI = 0.902, GFI = 0.974, root mean square error of approximation  (RMSEA) = 0.092, indicating inadequate model fit. After modification according to  software indices, χ2(2) = 2.052, CFI = 0.999, GFI = 0.999, RMSEA = 0.020  indicated an acceptable fit of the model (final model). The factor loadings of 6  subscales were all significant (P <.001), with .147 for nutrition, .137 for  activity, .167 for friction and shear, .825 for sensory perception, .626 for  mobility, and .556 for moisture subscale. The nutrition, activity, and friction  and shear subscales were corrected to examine their relationships with other  Braden Scale subscales (nutrition with activity [φ -0.063], activity with  friction/shear [φ 0.136], and nutrition (φ friction/shear [0.159]). The factor  loadings ranged from -0.067 to 0.159. These findings suggest the original Braden  Scale has inadequate construct validity for acute care patients and that new  risk-predicting scales should be designed based on data mining. Second, according  to the factor loadings in the SEM, the most important risk factor in the Braden  Scale for this patient population is sensory perception, followed by mobility and  moisture. This suggests practitioners should pay particular attention to pressure  ulcer prevention when patients have limited sensory perception, mobility  limitations, and/or when moisture status is less than optimal.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypoperfusion is associated with hyperfibrinolysis and early death from exsanguination, whereas tissue trauma is associated with hypofibrinolysis  and delayed death from organ failure. We sought to elucidate the effects of  injury patterns on fibrinolysis phenotypes using a nonhuman primate (NHP) model.  METHODS: NHPs were randomized to three injury groups (n = 8/group): 60 minutes  severe pressure-targeted controlled hemorrhagic shock (HS); HS + soft tissue  injury (HS+); or HS + soft tissue injury + femur fracture (HS++). Animals were  resuscitated and monitored for 360 minutes. Blood samples were collected at  baseline, end-of-shock, end-of-resuscitation (EOR), and T = 360 minutes for  assessments of: severity of shock (lactate) and coagulation via prothrombin time,  partial thromboplastin time, D-dimer, fibrinogen, antithrombin-III, von  Willebrand factor, and viscoelastic testing (ROTEM). Results are reported as mean  ± SEM; statistics: two-way analysis of variance and t-tests (significance: p <  0.05). RESULTS: Blood loss, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time,  antithrombin-III, fibrinogen, and von Willebrand factor were equivalent among  groups and viscoelastic testing revealed few differences throughout the study.  D-dimer increased approximately threefold, at EOR in the HS group, and at T = 360  minutes in the HS+ and HS++ groups (p < 0.05). At EOR, in the HS group compared  with the HS+ and HS++ groups; the D-dimer-lactate ratio was twofold greater (2.2  ± 0.3 vs. 1.1 ± 0.3 and 1.1 ± 0.2, respectively; p < 0.05) and tissue  factor-activated fibrin clot 30-minute lysis index was lower (98 ± 1% vs. 100 ±  0% and 100 ± 0%, respectively; p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: NHPs in HS exhibit acute  suppression of fibrinolysis in the presence of tissue injury. Additional  assessments to more comprehensively evaluate the mechanisms linking tissue injury  with the observed fibrinolysis shutdown response are warranted.

AB  - Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a large, non-sulfated glucosaminoglycan abundantly present at sites where fibrin is also formed (during wound healing, in arterial  restenotic lesions and eroded atherosclerotic plaques). The aim of the present  study was to characterize the structure of composite fibrin-HA clots with  scanning electron microscopy (SEM), pressure-driven permeation and small-angle  X-ray scattering (SAXS) and their viscoelastic properties with an oscillation  rheometer. In addition the efficiency of fibrinolysis in these clots was  investigated by kinetic turbidimetric and chromogenic assays for dissolution of  fibrin and plasminogen activation by tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA).  Fibrin formed in the presence of native (1500kDa) HA and its 500kDa fragments had  thicker fibers and larger pores according to the SEM and clot permeation data,  whereas the 25kDa HA fragments had only minor effects. SAXS evidenced a mild  disarrangement of protofibrils. These structural alterations suggest that HA  modifies the pattern of fibrin polymerization favouring lateral association of  protofibrils over formation of branching points. Rheometer data showed softer  fibrin structures formed with 1500kDa and 500kDa HA and these clots presented  with lower dynamic viscosity values and lower critical stress values at gel/fluid  transition. tPA-catalysed plasminogen activation was markedly inhibited by HA,  both in free solution and on the surface of fibrin clots, in the presence and in  the absence of 6-aminohexanoate suggesting a kringle-independent mechanism. HA of  1500 and 500kDa size prolonged clot lysis with both plasmin and tPA and this  inhibition was kringle-mediated, because it was abolished by 6-aminohexanoate and  was not observed with des-(kringle1-4)-plasmin. Our data suggest that HA  size-dependently modifies the pattern of fibrin polymerization with consequent  inhibition of fibrinolysis. At sites of tissue injury and inflammation, HA could  stabilize fibrin through modification of its structure and lysibility.

AB  - RATIONALE: Controlled mechanical ventilation is used to deliver lung-protective ventilation in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Despite  recognized benefits, such as preserved diaphragm activity, partial support  ventilation modes may be incompatible with lung-protective ventilation due to  high Vt and high transpulmonary pressure. As an alternative to high-dose  sedatives and controlled mechanical ventilation, pharmacologically induced  neuromechanical uncoupling of the diaphragm should facilitate lung-protective  ventilation under partial support modes. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether  partial neuromuscular blockade can facilitate lung-protective ventilation while  maintaining diaphragm activity under partial ventilatory support. METHODS: In a  proof-of-concept study, we enrolled 10 patients with lung injury and a Vt greater  than 8 ml/kg under pressure support ventilation (PSV) and under sedation. After  baseline measurements, rocuronium administration was titrated to a target Vt of 6  ml/kg during neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA). Thereafter, patients  were ventilated in PSV and NAVA under continuous rocuronium infusion for 2 hours.  Respiratory parameters, hemodynamic parameters, and blood gas values were  measured. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Rocuronium titration resulted in  significant declines of Vt (mean ± SEM, 9.3 ± 0.6 to 5.6 ± 0.2 ml/kg;  P < 0.0001), transpulmonary pressure (26.7 ± 2.5 to 10.7 ± 1.2 cm H(2)O;  P < 0.0001), and diaphragm electrical activity (17.4 ± 2.3 to 4.5 ± 0.7 μV;  P < 0.0001), and could be maintained under continuous rocuronium infusion. During  titration, pH decreased (7.42 ± 0.02 to 7.35 ± 0.02; P < 0.0001), and mean  arterial blood pressure increased (84 ± 6 to 99 ± 6 mm Hg; P = 0.0004), as did  heart rate (83 ± 7 to 93 ± 8 beats/min; P = 0.0004). CONCLUSIONS: Partial  neuromuscular blockade facilitates lung-protective ventilation during partial  ventilatory support, while maintaining diaphragm activity, in sedated patients  with lung injury.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the incidence of mortality, diarrheal diseases, scabies and falls; and the prevalence of pressure ulcers - all of which are related to  the safety ofinstitutionalized older adults. METHOD: This was a documentary  retrospective study developed in a long-term residential careinstitution for  older adults in the Northeast region of Brazil. The data were gathered from  records of health assessment indicators filed between January 2008 and December  2015. Analysis included absolute case frequency; the sum of monthly prevalence  and incidence rates; mean values of cases; and mean annual incidence and  prevalence rates. RESULTS: The incidence of mortality over these nine years  ranged from 9% to 13%; of acute diarrheic disease from 13% to 45%; and scabies  from 21% to 63%. The prevalence of pressure ulcers ranged from 8% to 23%. Between  2012 and 2015, the incidence rate of falls without injury varied from 38% to 83%,  and with injury from12% to 20%. CONCLUSION: Analysis of the health indicators  revealeda high incidence of scabies and falls and a high prevalence of pressure  ulcers. The identification of less than optimal rates for performance indicators  canhelp improve the quality of nursing care. OBJETIVO: Identificar a incidência  de mortalidade, doenças diarreicas, escabiose e quedas, e a prevalência de lesões  por pressão para a segurança do idoso institucionalizado. MÉTODO: Estudo  documental, retrospectivo desenvolvido em uma Instituição de Longa Permanência  para Idosos, localizada no nordeste do Brasil. Os dados foram coletados por meio  dos registros dos indicadores de avaliação de saúde, arquivados de janeiro de  2008 a dezembro de 2015. A análise incluiu a frequência absoluta dos casos; o  somatório das taxas de prevalência e incidência mensais; a média de casos e das  taxas de incidência e prevalência anuais. RESULTADOS: Observa-se que a incidência  de óbitos nos nove anos considerados variou de 9 a 13%; de doenças diarreicas  agudas, de 13 a 45%; e de escabiose, de 21 a 63%. A prevalência de lesão por  pressão oscilou de 8 a 23%. Entre os anos de 2012 a 2015, a taxa de incidência de  quedas sem lesão variou em torno de 38 a 83%, e com lesão, de 12 a 20%.  CONCLUSÃO: A análise da amplitude dos indicadores de saúde permitiu identificar a  alta incidência de escabiose e de quedas e a elevada prevalência de lesões por  pressão. A identificação do comprometimento dos indicadores contribui para  otimização da qualidade da assistência de enfermagem.

AB  - OBJECTIVE In acute traumatic brain injury, decompressive craniectomy is a common treatment that involves the removal of bone from the cranium to relieve  intracranial pressure. The present study investigated whether neurological  function following a severe spinal cord injury improves after utilizing either a  durotomy to decompress the intradural space and/or a duraplasty to maintain  proper flow of cerebrospinal fluid. METHODS Sixty-four adult female rats (n = 64)  were randomly assigned to receive either a 3- or 5-level decompressive  laminectomy (Groups A and B), laminectomy + durotomy (Groups C and D), or  laminectomy + duraplasty with graft (Group E and F) at 24 hours following a  severe thoracic contusion injury (200 kilodynes). Duraplasty involved the use of  DuraSeal, a hydrogel dural sealant. Uninjured and injured control groups were  included (Groups G, H). Hindlimb locomotor function was assessed by open field  locomotor testing (BBB) and CatWalk gait analysis at 35 days postinjury. Bladder  function was analyzed and bladder wall thickness was assessed histologically. At  35 days postinjury, mechanical and thermal allodynia were assessed by the Von  Frey hair filament and hotplate paw withdrawal tests, respectively. Thereafter,  the spinal cords were dissected, examined for gross anomalies at the injury site,  and harvested for histological analyses to assess lesion volumes and white matter  sparing. ANOVA was used for statistical analyses. RESULTS There was no  significant improvement in motor function recovery in any treatment groups  compared with injured controls. CatWalk gait analysis indicated a significant  decrease in interlimb coordination in Groups B, C, and D (p < 0.05) and swing  speed in Groups A, B, and D. Increased mechanical pain sensitivity was observed  in Groups A, C, and F (p < 0.05). Rats in Group C also developed thermal pain  hypersensitivity. Examination of spinal cords demonstrated increased lesion  volumes in Groups C and F and increased white matter sparing in Group E (p <  0.05). The return of bladder automaticity was similar in all groups. Examination  of the injury site during tissue harvest revealed that, in some instances,  expansion of the hydrogel dural sealant caused compression of the spinal cord.  CONCLUSIONS Surgical decompression provided no benefit in terms of neurological  improvement in the setting of a severe thoracic spinal cord contusion injury in  rats at 24 hours postinjury. Decompressive laminectomy and durotomy did not  improve motor function recovery, and rats in both of these treatment modalities  developed neuropathic pain. Performing a durotomy also led to increased lesion  volumes. Placement of DuraSeal was shown to cause compression in some rats in the  duraplasty treatment groups. Decompressive duraplasty of 3 levels does not affect  functional outcomes after injury but did increase white matter sparing.  Decompressive duraplasty of 5 levels led to neuropathic pain development and  increased lesion volumes. Further comparison of dural repair techniques is  necessary.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this 12-week, randomized, double-blind trial, 55  insulin-naïve patients with type 2 diabetes (mean ± SEM: age 63 ± 7 years, BMI  31.8 ± 4.1 kg/m(2), glomerular filtration rate [GFR] 83 ± 16 mL/min/1.73 m(2);  median [interquartile range]: albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) 1.09 mg/mmol  [0.47-3.31]) received sitagliptin (100 mg/day), liraglutide (1.8 mg/day), or  matching placebos. GFR (primary end point) and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF)  were determined by inulin and para-aminohippuric acid clearance, respectively.  Intrarenal hemodynamic variables were estimated. Absolute and fractional  excretions of sodium (FE(Na)), potassium, and urea (FE(U)) and renal damage  markers (ACR, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin [NGAL], and kidney  injury molecule-1 [KIM-1]) were measured. Plasma renin concentration (PRC) and  glycated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) were assessed. At weeks 2 and 6, estimated GFR and  fractional electrolyte excretions were determined. RESULTS: At week 12, GFR was  not affected by sitagliptin (-6 mL/min/1.73 m(2) [95% CI -14 to 3], P = 0.17) or  liraglutide (+3 mL/min/1.73 m(2) [-5 to 11], P = 0.46), compared with placebo.  Sitagliptin modestly reduced estimated glomerular hydraulic pressure (P(GLO); P =  0.043). ERPF, other intrarenal hemodynamic variables, renal damage markers, and  PRC did not change for both treatments. Both agents reduced HbA(1c). Only at week  2, sitagliptin increased FE(Na) and FE(U) (P = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Twelve-week  treatment with sitagliptin or liraglutide does not affect measured renal  hemodynamics. No sustained changes in tubular functions or alteration in renal  damage markers were observed. The validity and clinical relevance of the slight  sitagliptin-induced P(GLO) reduction remains speculative.

AB  - OBJECTIVE Adult-onset hydrocephalus is not commonly discussed in the literature, especially regarding its demographic distribution. In contrast to pediatric  hydrocephalus, which is related to a primary CSF pathway defect, its development  in adults is often secondary to other pathologies. In this study, the authors  investigated the epidemiology of adult-onset hydrocephalus as it pertains to  different etiologies and in reference to age, sex, and race distributions.  METHODS The authors retrospectively reviewed the clinical notes of 2001 patients  with adult-onset hydrocephalus who presented to Louisiana State University Health  Sciences Center within a 25-year span. Significant differences between the groups  were analyzed by a chi-square test; p < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS  The overall mean (± SEM) incidence of adult hydrocephalus in this population was  77 ± 30 per year, with a significant increase in incidence in the past decade (55  ± 3 [1990-2003] vs 102 ± 6 [2004-2015]; p < 0.0001). Hydrocephalus in a majority  of the patients had a vascular etiology (45.5%) or was a result of a tumor  (30.2%). The incidence of hydrocephalus in different age groups varied according  to various pathologies. The incidence was significantly higher in males with  normal-pressure hydrocephalus (p = 0.03) or head injury (p = 0.01) and higher in  females with pseudotumor cerebri (p < 0.0001). In addition, the overall incidence  of hydrocephalus was significantly higher in Caucasian patients (p = 0.0002) than  in those of any other race. CONCLUSIONS Knowledge of the demographic variations  in adult-onset hydrocephalus is helpful in achieving better risk stratification  and better managing the disease in patients. For general applicability, these  results should be validated in a large-scale meta-analysis based on a national  population database.

AB  - AIMS: Compartment syndrome results from increased intra-compartmental pressure (ICP) causing local tissue ischaemia and cell death, but the systemic effects are  not well described. We hypothesised that compartment syndrome would have a  profound effect not only on the affected limb, but also on remote organs.  METHODS: Using a rat model of compartment syndrome, its systemic effects on the  viability of hepatocytes and on inflammation and circulation were directly  visualised using intravital video microscopy. RESULTS: We found that  hepatocellular injury was significantly higher in the compartment syndrome group  (192 PI-labelled cells/10(-1) mm(3), standard error of the mean (sem) 51)  compared with controls (30 PI-labelled cells/10(-1) mm(3), sem 12, p < 0.01). The  number of adherent venular white blood cells was significantly higher for the  compartment syndrome group (5 leukocytes/30s/10 000 μm(2), sem 1) than controls  (0.2 leukocytes/30 s/10 000 μm(2), sem 0.2, p < 0.01). Volumetric blood flow was  not significantly different between the two groups, although there was an  increase in the heterogeneity of perfusion. CONCLUSIONS: Compartment syndrome can  be accompanied by severe systemic inflammation and end organ damage. This study  provides evidence of the relationship between compartment syndrome in a limb and  systemic inflammation and dysfunction in a remote organ.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Leea macrophylla Roxb. ex Hornem. (Leeaceae) commonly known as Hastikarnapalasa is mainly distributed throughout the tropical  parts of India. Traditionally, the plant is found to be effective against guinea  worm, ringworm and is applied to sores and wounds. AIM OF THE STUDY: The present  study aims to validate traditional wound healing claim of Leea macrophylla  scientifically. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Box-Behnken design (BBD) was used to  optimize the extraction process. The optimized root tuber extract of Leea  macrophylla was standardized with chlorogenic acid by HPLC for the first time.  Both oral and topical routes were selected as administrative means for the wound  healing study using excision and incision wound model. For topical treatment  bioadhesive gel was formulated and characterized for mechanical and physical  characteristics by texture profile analysis (TPA) and scanning electron  microscopy (SEM). The effect on wound healing was also assessed by evaluating  antioxidant enzymes viz. glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and  catalase (CAT), free radicals lipid peroxidation (LPO) and nitric oxide (NO),  inflammatory marker myeloperoxidase (MPO), collagen markers hydroxyproline,  hexosamine and hexuronic acid along with the histopathological examination.  Furthermore, the effect on the level of the proinflammatory cytokines  interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin -6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)  and growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were determined. The  expression of cell proliferation nuclear marker Ki-67 was also analyzed by  Western blot analysis. RESULTS: With mesh openings Sieve no. 20, semi polar  nature of solvent (92.5:7.5 ethanol-water blend) and extraction time of 18h,  substantially greater extraction efficiency (29%) and phenolic yield (181.54mg/g)  were obtained. The content of chlorogenic acid in ethanol extracts of Leea  macrophylla was obtained as 9.01% w/w. In incision model, oral treatment with  500mg/kg ethanolic extract increased wound breaking strength by 23.41% while  bioadhesive gel (5% w/v) showed a higher increase of 44.68%. Topical application  produced complete wound contraction in 20 days against 22 days taken by oral  treatment. Topical treatment also produced a significant (p<0.05) increase in  antioxidants glutathione, superoxide dismutase and catalase whereas the level of  enzymes lipid peroxidation and nitric oxide and inflammatory markers  myeloperoxidase were reduced. Further advantageous effects were reflected by  significantly (p<0.05) increased levels of hydroxyproline, hexosamine and  hexuronic acid. Favorable effects on the level of proinflammatory cytokines  interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor - α and growth factor,  vascular endothelial growth factor were also observed. The wound healing  potential of Leea macrophylla was further supported by its ability to promote  cell proliferation during wound healing as demonstrated by Western blot analysis  of proliferation marker Ki-67. CONCLUSION: The study justified traditional use of  Leea macrophylla in wound healing and demonstrated that the bioadhesive gel of  ethanolic extract produced faster and more significant healing as compared to  oral treatment.

AB  - Economic constraints are a major obstacle to the implementation of offloading casts in India. The aim of this study is to monitor the healing and activity  limitations related to Bohler iron plaster cast (BIPC) when used for offloading  diabetic neuropathic plantar foot ulcers. Thirty patients were cast for 1 month  and evaluated for healing using the Pressure Ulcer Scale for Healing (PUSH), and  for activity limitation using the Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS). The  change in the scores after intervention was the outcome measure. There was good  healing as evidenced by a statistical difference in mean PUSH scores. The  baseline PUSH score of 9.76-0.41 (T1-SEM) was greater than follow-up PUSH score  of 6.32 + 0.41 (T2 + SEM) and the p value <0.0001. Improvement was seen in ulcer  area, exudate, and tissue type. There was no mobility effect as there was no  significant difference in LEFS. Significant negative correlation was there  between PUSH and LEFS. The r value was less than -0.7 both at baseline and after  intervention. The combined benefits of good healing, lack of affect on lower  extremity function, the ease of application and dressing, and relative  affordability make BIPC a commendable offloading modality for the management of  diabetic plantar ulcers.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop and evaluate a biodegradable superporous hydrogel based wound healing composite of chitosan and alginate incorporated with curcumin and  honey. METHOD: A 3(2) factorial design was adopted to optimise the honey-curcumin  hydrogel composite sponge (CHS). Sodium alginate and chitosan were dissolved in  deionised water and 1% aqueous acetic acid solution at room temperature,  respectively. Ethanolic solution of curcumin was poured into the chitosan  solution followed by an addition of sodium alginate solution. In situ  polymerisation was carried out by adding acrylamide base components to the  polymeric solution of curcumin. Finally, honey was added with slow stirring and a  sponge was cast on a glass surface by solvent evaporation at 45ºC. The produced  sponge was assessed for swelling capacity, moisture loss, tensile strength,  biocompatibility, bioadhesion, biodegradation, drug diffusion and wound healing  properties. The morphology of CHS was studied by scanning electron microscopy  (SEM). RESULTS: The optimised CHS demonstrated a high swelling capacity (111.05 ±  05%), tensile strength (4323gm/mm(2)), in vitro drug diffusion (75.03 ±  3.59%/20days), bioadhesion (20 ± 0.2mg force) and ability of water vapour  transmission. A rapid induction of tissue granulation and re-epithelialisation  was observed. Time to complete healing (94.14 ± 1.04% wound contraction) was 7 ±  2 days. CONCLUSION: This study has shown that honey-curcumin hydrogel composite  sponge can be formulated by a simple mixing and in situ polymerisation method.  The hydrogel base provided a dry wound bed due to excellent fluid absorption  capacity. Chitosan and honey contributed to effective faster wound healing. We  recommend further clinical studies of the soft sponge wound healing composite for  diabetic foot or pressure ulcers.

AB  - Monitoring of intracranial pressure (ICP) may be indicated in children with traumatic brain injury, premature intraventricular hemorrhage, or hydrocephalus.  The standard technique is either a direct measurement with invasive intracranial  insertion of ICP probes or indirect noninvasive assessment using transfontanelle  ultrasonography to measure blood flow. The authors have developed a new technique  that allows noninvasive epicutaneous transfontanelle ICP measurement with  standard ICP probes. They compared the ICP measurements obtained using the same  type of standard probe used in 2 different ways in 5 infants (age < 1 year)  undergoing surgery for craniosynostosis. The first ICP probe was implanted  epidurally (providing control measurements) and the second probe was fixed  epicutaneously on the skin over the reopened frontal fontanelle. ICP values were  measured hourly for the first 24 hours after surgery and the values obtained with  the 2 methods were compared using Bland-Altman 2-methods analysis. A total of 110  pairs of measurements were assessed. There was no significant difference between  the ICPs measured using the epicutaneous transfontanelle method (mean 13.10 mm  Hg, SEM 6.68 mm Hg) and the epidural measurements (mean 12.46 mm Hg, SEM 6.45 mm  Hg; p = 0.4643). The results of this analysis indicate that epicutaneous  transfontanelle measurement of ICP is a reliable method that allows noninvasive  ICP monitoring in children under the age of 1 year. Such noninvasive ICP  monitoring could be implemented in the therapy of children with traumatic brain  injury or intraventricular hemorrhage or for screening children with elevated ICP  without invasive intracranial implantation of ICP probes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Interventions to prevent rape perpetration must be designed to address its drivers. This paper seeks to extend understanding of drivers of  single and multiple perpetrator rape (referred to here as SPR and MPR  respectively) and the relationships between socio-economic status, childhood  trauma, peer pressure, other masculine behaviours and rape. METHOD: 1370 young  men aged 15 to 26 were interviewed as part of the randomised controlled trial  evaluation of Stepping Stones in the rural Eastern Cape. We used multinomial to  compare the characteristics of men who reported rape perpetration at baseline. We  used structural equation modelling (SEM) to examine pathways to rape  perpetration. RESULTS: 76.1% of young men had never raped, 10.0% had perpetrated  SPR and 13.9% MPR. The factors associated with both MPR and SPR (compared to  never having raped) were indicators of socio-economic status (SES), childhood  trauma, sexual coercion by a woman, drug and alcohol use, peer pressure  susceptibility, having had transactional sex, multiple sexual partners and being  physically violent towards a partner. The SEM showed the relationship between SES  and rape perpetration to be mediated by gender inequitable masculinity. It was  complex as there was a direct path indicating that SES correlated with the  masculinity variable directly such that men of higher SES had more gender  inequitable masculinities, and indirect path mediated by peer pressure resistance  indicated that the former pertained so long as men lacked peer pressure  resistance. Having a higher SES conveyed greater resistance for some men. There  was also a path mediated through childhood trauma, such that men of lower SES  were more likely to have a higher childhood trauma exposure and this correlated  with a higher likelihood of having the gender inequitable masculinity (with or  without the mediating effect of peer pressure resistance). DISCUSSION: Both  higher and lower socio-economic status were associated with raping. Prevention of  rape perpetration must focus on changing men's gender ideals, entitlements and  inequitable practices. Reducing poverty and adverse childhood experiences should  also be of benefit.

T2  - International wound journal
AB  - Current detection of pressure ulcers relies on visual and tactile changes at the skin surface, but physiological changes below the skin precede surface changes  and have a significant impact on tissue health. Inflammatory and  apoptotic/necrotic changes in the epidermal and dermal layers of the skin, such  as changes in interstitial fluid (also known as subepidermal moisture (SEM)), may  precede surface changes by 3-10 days. Those same epidermal and subepidermal  changes result in changes in the electrical properties (bioimpedance) of the  tissue, thereby presenting an objective, non-invasive method for assessing tissue  damage. Clinical studies of bioimpedance for the detection of pressure ulcers  have demonstrated that changes in bioimpedance correlate with increasing severity  of pressure ulcer stages. Studies have also demonstrated that at anatomical  locations with pressure ulcers, bioimpedance varies with distance from the centre  of the pressure ulcers. The SEM Scanner, a handheld medical device, offers an  objective and reliable method for the assessment of local bioimpedance, and  therefore, assessment of tissue damage before signs become visible to the unaided  eye. This literature review summarises pressure ulcer pathophysiology, principles  of bioimpedance and clinical research using bioimpedance technology to assess  pressure ulcers.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We recently showed that increased intracranial pressure to 50 mm Hg in the healthy rat brain results in microvascular shunt flow characterized by  tissue hypoxia, edema, and increased blood-brain barrier permeability. We now  determined whether increased intracranial pressure results in neuronal injury by  Fluoro-Jade stain and whether changes in cerebral blood flow and cerebral  metabolic rate for oxygen suggest nonnutritive microvascular shunt flow. DESIGN:  Intracranial pressure was elevated by a reservoir of artificial cerebrospinal  fluid connected to the cisterna magna. Arterial blood gases, cerebral  arterial-venous oxygen content difference, and cerebral blood flow by MRI were  measured. Fluoro-Jade stain neurons were counted in histologic sections of the  right and left dorsal and lateral cortices and hippocampus. SETTING: University  laboratory. SUBJECTS: Male Sprague Dawley rats. INTERVENTIONS: Arterial pressure  support if needed by IV dopamine infusion and base deficit corrected by sodium  bicarbonate. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Fluoro-Jade stain neurons increased  2.5- and 5.5-fold at intracranial pressures of 30 and 50 mm Hg and cerebral  perfusion pressures of 57 ± 4 (mean ± SEM) and 47 ± 6 mm Hg, respectively (p <  0.001) (highest in the right and left cortices). Voxel frequency histograms of  cerebral blood flow showed a pattern consistent with microvascular shunt flow by  dispersion to higher cerebral blood flow at high intracranial pressure and  decreased cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen. CONCLUSIONS: High intracranial  pressure likely caused neuronal injury because of a transition from normal  capillary flow to nonnutritive microvascular shunt flow resulting in tissue  hypoxia and edema, and it is manifest by a reduction in the cerebral metabolic  rate for oxygen.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Anesthetic preconditioning (APC) is a clinically important phenomenon in which volatile anesthetics (VAs) protect tissues such as heart against  ischemic injury. The mechanism of APC is thought to involve K channels encoded by  the Slo gene family, and the authors showed previously that slo-2 is required for  APC in Caenorhabditis elegans. Thus, the authors hypothesized that a slo-2  ortholog may mediate APC-induced cardioprotection in mammals. METHODS: A perfused  heart model of ischemia-reperfusion injury, a fluorescent assay for K flux, and  mice lacking Slo2.1 (Slick), Slo2.2 (Slack), or both (double knockouts, Slo2.x  dKO) were used to test whether these channels are required for APC-induced  cardioprotection and for cardiomyocyte or mitochondrial K transport. RESULTS: In  wild-type (WT) hearts, APC improved post-ischemia-reperfusion functional recovery  (APC = 39.5 ± 3.7% of preischemic rate × pressure product vs. 20.3 ± 2.3% in  controls, means ± SEM, P = 0.00051, unpaired two-tailed t test, n = 8) and  lowered infarct size (APC = 29.0 ± 4.8% of LV area vs. 51.4 ± 4.5% in controls, P  = 0.0043, n = 8). Protection by APC was absent in hearts from Slo2.1 mice (%  recovery APC = 14.6 ± 2.6% vs. 16.5 ± 2.1% in controls, P = 0.569, n = 8 to 9,  infarct APC = 52.2 ± 5.4% vs. 53.5 ± 4.7% in controls, P = 0.865, n = 8 to 9).  APC protection was also absent in Slo2.x dKO hearts (% recovery APC = 11.0 ± 1.7%  vs. 11.9 ± 2.2% in controls, P = 0.725, n = 8, infarct APC = 51.6 ± 4.4% vs. 50.5  ± 3.9% in controls, P = 0.855, n = 8). Meanwhile, Slo2.2 hearts responded similar  to WT (% recovery APC = 41.9 ± 4.0% vs. 18.0 ± 2.5% in controls, P = 0.00016, n =  8, infarct APC = 25.2 ± 1.3% vs. 50.8 ± 3.3% in controls, P < 0.000005, n = 8).  Furthermore, VA-stimulated K transport seen in cardiomyocytes or mitochondria  from WT or Slo2.2 mice was absent in Slo2.1 or Slo2.x dKO. CONCLUSION: Slick  (Slo2.1) is required for both VA-stimulated K flux and for the APC-induced  cardioprotection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hemorrhage remains the leading cause of potentially survivable trauma mortality. Recent reports indicate that injuries sustained in noncompressible  anatomic locations (i.e., truncal and junctional) account for 86.5% of  hemorrhage-related deaths. Infusible human platelet-derived hemostatic agents  (hPDHAs) represent a promising strategy to reduce blood loss from noncompressible  injuries. Here, we evaluate the hemostatic efficacy of a lyophilized hPDHA in a  rhesus macaque model of severe, uncontrolled hemorrhage. METHODS: Hemorrhage was  induced via laparoscopic 60% left-lobe hepatectomy in anesthetized rhesus  macaques (T = 0 minute). Treatment infusion began with an 11-mL bolus (T = 5-6  minutes) of either 5% albumin solution (control; n = 8) or hPDHA (1.2 × 10(10)  platelet equivalents, n = 8), followed by 2.8-mL/min 0.9% normal saline at T =  6-20 minutes. Resuscitation continued with normal saline (0.22 mL/kg/min) to a  total volume of 20 mL/kg at T = 120 minutes, at which time surgical hemostasis  was achieved and percent blood loss quantified. Animals were monitored until T =  480 minutes and then euthanized, and necropsy was performed with emphasis on  intravascular and end-organ thrombi. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM;  significance, p < 0.05. RESULTS: Both groups exhibited a ∼70% decrease in mean  arterial pressure (MAP) from T = 0-5 minutes. Percent blood loss was 44.2 ± 3.9%  in hPDHA animals, and 44.3 ± 3.3% in controls. Survival rates were 4 of 8 for  hPDHA animals and 7 of 8 for controls. Regardless of treatment, percent blood  loss was greater (p < 0.02) in nonsurviving animals (55 ± 2%, n = 5) compared  with surviving animals (42% ± 3%, n = 11). No pathologic intravascular thrombi  were observed in either group. CONCLUSION: The isolated administration of hPDHA  did not significantly reduce blood loss; however, thrombocytopenia was not  present in the model, and clinically, platelets would be administered in  combination with plasma. Mortality was not statistically different between groups  (p = 0.14) but was related to blood loss. Future studies should consider the use  of hPDHA in combination with additional therapeutics (e.g., factors) and a model  that incorporates thrombocytopenia or platelet dysfunction.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pressure ulcers (i.e. bedsores, pressure sores, pressure injuries, decubitus ulcers) are areas of localised damage to the skin and underlying  tissue. They are common in the elderly and immobile, and costly in financial and  human terms. Pressure-relieving support surfaces (i.e. beds, mattresses, seat  cushions etc) are used to help prevent ulcer development. OBJECTIVES: This  systematic review seeks to establish:(1) the extent to which pressure-relieving  support surfaces reduce the incidence of pressure ulcers compared with standard  support surfaces, and,(2) their comparative effectiveness in ulcer prevention.  SEARCH METHODS: In April 2015, for this fourth update we searched The Cochrane  Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 15 April 2015) which includes the  results of regular searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL and The Cochrane  Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2015, Issue  3). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised  trials, published or unpublished, that assessed the effects of any support  surface for prevention of pressure ulcers, in any patient group or setting which  measured pressure ulcer incidence. Trials reporting only proxy outcomes (e.g.  interface pressure) were excluded. Two review authors independently selected  trials. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted by one review author  and checked by another. Where appropriate, estimates from similar trials were  pooled for meta-analysis. MAIN RESULTS: For this fourth update six new trials  were included, bringing the total of included trials to 59.Foam alternatives to  standard hospital foam mattresses reduce the incidence of pressure ulcers in  people at risk (RR 0.40 95% CI 0.21 to 0.74). The relative merits of alternating-  and constant low-pressure devices are unclear. One high-quality trial suggested  that alternating-pressure mattresses may be more cost effective than  alternating-pressure overlays in a UK context.Pressure-relieving overlays on the  operating table reduce postoperative pressure ulcer incidence, although two  trials indicated that foam overlays caused adverse skin changes. Meta-analysis of  three trials suggest that Australian standard medical sheepskins prevent pressure  ulcers (RR 0.56 95% CI 0.32 to 0.97).  AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: People at high risk  of developing pressure ulcers should use higher-specification foam mattresses  rather than standard hospital foam mattresses. The relative merits of  higher-specification constant low-pressure and alternating-pressure support  surfaces for preventing pressure ulcers are unclear, but alternating-pressure  mattresses may be more cost effective than alternating-pressure overlays in a UK  context. Medical grade sheepskins are associated with a decrease in pressure  ulcer development. Organisations might consider the use of some forms of pressure  relief for high risk patients in the operating theatre.

AB  - Burn scars are frequently accompanied with sensory deficits often remaining present months or even years after injury. Clinimetric properties of assessment  tools remain understudied within burn literature. Tactile sense of touch can be  examined with the touch pressure threshold (TPT) method using the Semmes  Weinstein monofilament test (SWMT). There is in recent research no consensus on  the exact measurement procedure when using the SWMT. The aim of this paper was to  determine the interrater and intrarater reliability of TPT within burn scars and  healthy controls using the 'ascending descending' measurement procedure. We used  the newly developed guidelines for reporting reliability and agreement studies  (GRRAS) as a basis to report this reliability study. In total 36 individuals were  tested; a healthy control group and a scar group. The interrater reliability was  excellent in the scar group (ICC=0.908/SEM=0.21) and fair to good in the control  group (ICC=0.731/SEM=0.12). In the scar group intrarater ICC value was excellent  (ICC=0.822/SEM=0.33). Within the control group also an excellent intrarater  reliability (ICC=0.807/SEM=0.27) was found. In conclusion this study shows that  the SWMT with the 'ascending descending' measurement procedure is a feasible and  reliable objective measure to evaluate TPT in (older) upper extremities burn  scars as well as in healthy skin.

AB  - Hemorrhage is the leading cause of potentially survivable trauma mortality, necessitating the development of improved therapeutic interventions. The  objective of this study was to develop and characterize a reproducible clinically  translatable nonhuman primate model of uncontrolled severe hemorrhage. Such a  model is required to facilitate the development and meaningful evaluation of  human-derived therapeutics. In Rhesus macaques, a laparoscopic left-lobe  hepatectomy of 25% (n = 2), 50% (n = 4), or 60% (n = 6) was performed at T = 0  min, with no attempt at hemorrhage control until T = 120 min. A constant-rate  infusion of normal saline was administered between T = 15 and 120 min to a total  volume of 20 mL/kg. At T = 120 min, a laparotomy was performed to gain surgical  hemostasis and quantify blood loss. Physiological parameters were recorded, and  blood samples were collected at defined intervals until termination of the study  at T = 480 min. Statistical analyses used Student t tests, with P < 0.05  considered statistically significant. Results are reported as mean ± SEM. The  calculated percent blood loss for the 25% hepatectomy group was negligible (2.3%  ± 0.2%), whereas the 50% and 60% hepatectomy groups exhibited 26.6% ± 7.1% and  24.9% ± 3.8% blood loss, respectively. At T = 5 min, blood pressure for the 25%,  50%, and 60% hepatectomy groups was reduced by 13.8%, 60.8%, and 63.2% from the  respective baseline values (P < 0.05). In the 60% hepatectomy group, alterations  in thromboelastometry parameters and systemic inflammatory markers were observed.  The development of a translatable nonhuman primate model of uncontrolled  hemorrhage is an ongoing process. This study demonstrates that 60% hepatectomy  offers a significant reproducible injury applicable for the evaluation of  human-derived therapeutics.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The SEM Scanner is a medical device designed for use by healthcare providers as part of pressure ulcer prevention programs. The objective of this  study was to evaluate the inter-rater and inter-device agreement and reliability  of the SEM Scanner. METHODS: Thirty-one (31) volunteers free of pressure ulcers  or broken skin at the sternum, sacrum, and heels were assessed with the SEM  Scanner. Each of three operators utilized each of three devices to collect  readings from four anatomical sites (sternum, sacrum, left and right heels) on  each subject for a total of 108 readings per subject collected over approximately  30 min. For each combination of operator-device-anatomical site, three SEM  readings were collected. Inter-operator and inter-device agreement and  reliability were estimated. RESULTS: Over the course of this study, more than  3000 SEM Scanner readings were collected. Agreement between operators was good  with mean differences ranging from -0.01 to 0.11. Inter-operator and inter-device  reliability exceeded 0.80 at all anatomical sites assessed. CONCLUSION: The  results of this study demonstrate the high reliability and good agreement of the  SEM Scanner across different operators and different devices. Given the  limitations of current methods to prevent and detect pressure ulcers, the SEM  Scanner shows promise as an objective, reliable tool for assessing the presence  or absence of pressure-induced tissue damage such as pressure ulcers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adequate hydration is key to good clinical care and essential for preventing problems in elderly patients such as constipation, pressure sores and  confusion. The present study aimed to evaluate fluid provision and consumption in  elderly patients against current standards for Scottish hospitals. METHODS: A  service evaluation, of fluid provision and consumption over 24 h by elderly  orthopaedic rehabilitation patients in a long-stay hospital in Scotland was  conducted. Fluids provided and consumed from trolley services, those at meal  times and beverages from jugs of water were measured. The average fluid content  of a jug, cup and glass on each ward was determined. Each jug of water provided  was recorded, as was the acceptance of hot and cold drinks offered. Intake was  determined by measuring the leftover water in each jug when these were refreshed  and any leftover liquid in patients' cups deducted from that provided.  Observations were made with respect to the presentation and encouragement of  fluids. RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients (12 males, 46 female, aged ≥65 years) were  monitored, of whom 56 were provided with more than the recommended minimum fluid  per day [mean (SEM) = 2379 (82) mL]; however, mean intake was lower than  recommended [mean (SEM) = 1302 (60) mL; P = 0.002]. Provision of drinks from a  trolley service [mean (SEM) = 956 (44) mL] was less than fluid from jugs [mean  (SEM) = 1398 (54) mL; P = 0.002]; however, the consumption of drinks from the  trolley was greater [77% consumed, mean (SEM) = 770 (46) mL] than from jugs [41%  mean (SEM) = 514 (36) mL; P < 0.001]. CONCLUSIONS: Patients consumed  significantly more fluid from individual beverages than jugs. Consideration of  the method of fluid provision is important with respect to influencing fluid  intakes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mesenchymal stem cells are proposed to facilitate repair of organ injuries. The aim of this study was to investigate whether local injection of  mesenchymal stem cells could accelerate healing of sutured gastric perforations.  METHODS: Sutured gastric perforations in rats were treated either with local  injection of mesenchymal stem cells (injected MSC group) or by topically spraying  with fibrin glue containing mesenchymal stem cells (sprayed MSC group). Controls  were treated by local injection of saline or topical spray of fibrin glue without  mesenchymal stem cells. Healing of sutured gastric perforations was assessed on  days 3, 5 and 7. RESULTS: Local injection of mesenchymal stem cells significantly  promoted the healing of gastric perforations, with the highest pneumatic bursting  pressure (mean(s.e.m.) 112·3(30·2) mmHg on day 5 versus 71·2(17·4) mmHg in saline  controls; P = 0·001), minimal wound adhesions, and lowest incidence of wound  dehiscence (3, 6, 5 and 1 animal on day 5 in control, fibrin, sprayed MSC and  injected MSC groups respectively; n = 10 per group) and abdominal abscess (2, 2,  1 and no animals respectively on day 5). Histological examination showed that  gastric perforations in the injected MSC group displayed reduced inflammation,  and increased granulation and re-epithelialization. Sutured gastric perforations  in the injected MSC group showed decreased expression of interleukin 6, and  increased expression of transforming growth factor β1 and epithelial  proliferating cell nuclear antigen, compared with the other groups. CONCLUSION:  Local injection of mesenchymal stem cells was more effective than topical  application, and enhanced the healing of sutured gastric perforations by an  anti-inflammatory process, enhanced cellular proliferation and earlier onset of  granulation. Surgical relevance Abnormal healing of gastric perforation may cause  morbidity and increase the risk of death. Adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem  cells have been found to promote the healing of organ injuries through cellular  differentiation and secretion of cytokines that stimulate cellular proliferation  and angiogenesis, and suppress inflammation. This study explored the therapeutic  potential of such mesenchymal stem cells for promotion of the healing of sutured  gastric perforations. Mesenchymal stem cells delivered by local injection  significantly enhanced the healing of gastric perforations with reduced severity  of wound adhesion, and a decreased incidence of wound dehiscence and abdominal  abscess. The increased expression of transforming growth factor β1, proliferating  cell nuclear antigen and reduced level of interleukin 6 provide evidence for  enhancement of the healing process. Engrafted mesenchymal stem cells expressed  α-smooth muscle actin as a marker of myofibroblasts. This preclinical study  indicates that local injection of allogeneic adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal  stem cells may have a potential therapeutic role in enhancing the healing of  peptic ulcer disease and prevention of ulcer-related complications.

T2  - Pulmonary circulation
AB  - Initiation, progression, and resolution of vaso-occlusive pain episodes in sickle cell disease (SCD) have been recognized as reperfusion injury, which provokes an  inflammatory response in the pulmonary circulation. Some 5-lipoxygenase (5-lox)  metabolites are potent vasoconstrictors in the pulmonary circulation. We studied  stimulation of production of the inflammatory eicosanoids leukotrienes (LTs) and  prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) by isolated rat lungs perfused with sickle (HbSS)  erythrocytes. Our hypothesis is that HbSS erythrocytes produce more LTs than  normal (HbAA) erythrocytes, which can induce vaso-occlusive episodes in SCD  patients. Lung perfusates were collected at specific time points and purified by  high-pressure liquid chromatography, and LTC4 and PGE2 contents were measured by  enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Rat lung explants were also cultured  with purified HbAA and HbSS peptides, and 5-lox, cyclooxygenase 1/2, and  platelet-activating factor receptor (PAFR) proteins were measured by Western  blotting, while prostacyclin and LTs produced by cultured lung explants were  measured by ELISA. Lung weight gain and blood gas data were not different among  the groups. HbSS-perfused lungs produced more LTC4 and PGE2 than HbAA-perfused  lungs: 10.40 ± 0.62 versus 0.92 ± 0.2 ng/g dry lung weight (mean ± SEM; P =  0.0001) for LTC4. Inclusion of autologous platelets (platelet-rich plasma)  elevated LTC4 production to 12.6 ± 0.96 and 7 ± 0.60 ng/g dry lung weight in HbSS  and HbAA perfusates, respectively. HbSS lungs also expressed more 5-lox and PAFR.  The data suggest that HbSS erythrocytes and activated platelets in patient's  pulmonary microcirculation will enhance the synthesis and release of the  proinflammatory mediators LTC4 and PGE2, both of which may contribute to onset of  the acute chest syndrome in SCD.

AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the use of a dual-phase multidetector computed tomography (CT)-based grading system alone and in combination with assessment of clinical  parameters at triage of patients with blunt splenic injury for determination of  appropriate treatment (observation, splenic artery embolization [SAE], or splenic  surgery). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This HIPAA-compliant retrospective study was  approved by the institutional review board, and the requirement for informed  consent was waived. Between January 2009 and July 2011, 171 hemodynamically  stable patients with blunt splenic injury underwent multidetector CT at admission  to the hospital. Images were reviewed by applying a multidetector CT-based  grading system, and the amount of hemoperitoneum was quantified. Demographic  data, vital signs, laboratory values, injury severity score, abbreviated injury  severity, final treatment decision, and success of nonsurgical treatment were  reviewed. Receiver operating characteristic curves and stepwise logistic  regression analyses were performed to determine the optimal parameters for  effective triage of patients. RESULTS: One hundred seventy one patients with  splenic injury underwent multidetector CT. At triage, clinical treatment  decisions were made, and patients received either observation (85 of 171 [50%])  or splenic intervention (surgery, 19 of 171 [11%] or splenic angiography, 67 of  171 [39%]). Four patients underwent SAE after unsuccessful observation. Six of  171 (3.5%) other patients received unsuccessful nonsurgical treatment with SAE.  No patients who received observation required splenectomy. Areas under the  receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) showed that the CT grading system  was the best individual predictor of successful observation (AUC, 0.95), and  stepwise logistic regression analysis results showed that multidetector CT grade  and the abbreviated injury scale score (AUC, 0.97; P = .02) were the best  combination of variables for selection of patients for observation versus splenic  intervention. The combination of abbreviated injury scale score, systolic blood  pressure reading, and serum glucose level was the best triage model for decision  making between splenectomy and SAE (AUC, 0.84). CONCLUSION: The best individual  predictor of successful observation in patients with blunt splenic injury was the  CT-based grading system. Multidetector CT grade and abbreviated injury scale  score were the best combination of variables for selection of patients for  observation versus splenic intervention.

AB  - BACKGROUND: 3% sodium chloride solution is the accepted treatment for hyponatremic encephalopathy, but evidence-based guidelines for its use are  lacking. STUDY DESIGN: A case series. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients  presenting to the emergency department of a university hospital with hyponatremic  encephalopathy, defined as serum sodium level < 130 mEq/L with neurologic  symptoms of increased intracranial pressure without other apparent cause, and  treated with a continuous infusion of 500mL of 3% sodium chloride solution over 6  hours through a peripheral vein. PREDICTORS: Hyponatremic encephalopathy defined  as serum sodium level < 130 mEq/L with neurologic symptoms of increased  intracranial pressure without other apparent cause. OUTCOMES: Change in serum  sodium level within 48 hours, improvement in neurologic symptoms, and clinical  evidence of cerebral demyelination, permanent neurologic injury, or death within  6 months' posttreatment follow-up. RESULTS: There were 71 episodes of  hyponatremic encephalopathy in 64 individuals. Comorbid conditions were present  in 86% of individuals. Baseline mean serum sodium level was 114.1±0.8 (SEM) mEq/L  and increased to 117.9±1.3, 121.2±1.2, 123.9±1.0, and 128.3±0.8 mEq/L at 3, 12,  24, and 48 hours following the initiation of 3% sodium chloride solution  treatment, respectively. There was a marked improvement in central nervous system  symptoms within hours of therapy in 69 of 71 (97%) episodes. There were 12  deaths, all of which occurred following the resolution of hyponatremic  encephalopathy and were related to comorbid conditions, with 75% of deaths  related to sepsis. No patient developed neurologic symptoms consistent with  cerebral demyelination at any point during the 6-month follow-up period.  LIMITATIONS: Lack of a comparison group and follow-up neuroimaging studies.  Number of cases is too small to provide definitive assessment of the safety of  this protocol. CONCLUSIONS: 3% sodium chloride solution was effective in  reversing the symptoms of hyponatremic encephalopathy in the emergency department  without producing neurologic injury related to cerebral demyelination on  long-term follow-up in this case series.

T2  - The journal of spinal cord medicine
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Characterization of a non-invasive method of quantifying subepidermal moisture (SEM) surrounding stages III and IV pressure ulcers (PrUs) in spinal  cord injury (SCI). DESIGN: Prospective, single-visit, single-rater, observational  study, using repeated-measures analysis. Method Setting-inpatient units of one VA  SCI Center. PARTICIPANTS: Convenience sample of 16 subjects with SCI with stage  III or IV PrUs over sacrum or ischium. Interventions Measurement with the  MoistureMeter-D, a hand-held device using 300 MHz electromagnetic waves. Outcome  measures Dielectric constant, a dimensionless number which increases with the  moisture content. Each subject had a PrU site and a control site. Measurements  were made at each site, on intact skin, at four points spaced angularly around  the site, in triplicate. Results (1) Short-term, single-rater relative error was  2.5%. (2) Order effect: first readings were higher than second readings in 55 of  64 measurement sets. Order effect was significant for control sites (P < 0.0001)  but not for PrU sites. (3) Angular effect: SEM varied by angle at the PrU sites  (P < 0.01); 12 o'clock position the highest and 6 o'clock the lowest. (4) Ability  to differentiate PrUs from intact skin: SEM at PrU sites was greater by 9.0% than  control sites (P < 0.05). (5) Site effect: SEM was higher at sacral locations  than ischial at control sites by 20% (P < 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: SEM differentiates  PrUs from intact skin. Future study designs must take into account order,  angular, and site effects on this measure. This information will inform designers  of future studies of SEM in healing of PrUs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patellar tendinopathy (PT) is one of the most common knee disorders among athletes. Changes in morphology and elasticity of the painful tendon and  how these relate to the self-perceived pain and dysfunction remain unclear.  OBJECTIVES: To compare the morphology and elastic properties of patellar tendons  between athlete with and without unilateral PT and to examine its association  with self-perceived pain and dysfunction. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study,  33 male athletes (20 healthy and 13 with unilateral PT) were enrolled. The  morphology and elastic properties of the patellar tendon were assessed by the  grey and elastography mode of supersonic shear imaging (SSI) technique while the  intensity of pressure pain, self-perceived pain and dysfunction were quantified  with a 10-lb force to the most painful site and the Victorian Institute of Sport  Assessment-patella (VISA-P) questionnaire, respectively. RESULTS: In athletes  with unilateral PT, the painful tendons had higher shear elastic modulus (SEM)  and larger tendon than the non-painful side (p<0.05) or the dominant side of the  healthy athletes (p<0.05). Significant correlations were found between tendon SEM  ratio (SEM of painful over non-painful tendon) and the intensity of pressure pain  (rho  = 0.62; p = 0.024), VISA-P scores (rho  = -0.61; p = 0.026), and the  sub-scores of the VISA-P scores on going down stairs, lunge, single leg hopping  and squatting (rho ranged from -0.63 to -0.67; p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Athletes  with unilateral PT had stiffer and larger tendon on the painful side than the  non-painful side and the dominant side of healthy athletes. No significant  differences on the patellar tendon morphology and elastic properties were  detected between the dominant and non-dominant knees of the healthy control. The  ratio of the SEM of painful to non-painful sides was associated with pain and  dysfunction among athletes with unilateral PT.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Improper mechanical ventilation settings can exacerbate acute lung injury by causing a secondary ventilator-induced lung injury. It is therefore  important to establish the mechanism by which the ventilator induces lung injury  to develop protective ventilation strategies. It has been postulated that the  mechanism of ventilator-induced lung injury is the result of heterogeneous,  elevated strain on the pulmonary parenchyma. Acute lung injury has been  associated with increases in whole-lung macrostrain, which is correlated with  increased pathology. However, the effect of mechanical ventilation on alveolar  microstrain remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the mechanical breath  profile of airway pressure release ventilation (APRV), consisting of a prolonged  pressure-time profile and brief expiratory release phase, reduces microstrain.  DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In a randomized, nonblinded laboratory animal  study, rats were randomized into a controlled mandatory ventilation group (n = 3)  and an APRV group (n = 3). Lung injury was induced by polysorbate lavage. A  thoracotomy was performed and an in vivo microscope was placed on the lungs to  measure alveolar mechanics. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: In the controlled  mandatory ventilation group, multiple levels of positive end-expiratory pressure  (PEEP; 5, 10, 16, 20, and 24 cm H2O) were tested. In the APRV group, decreasing  durations of expiratory release (time at low pressure [T(low)]) were tested. The  T(low) was set to achieve ratios of termination of peak expiratory flow rate  (T-PEFR) to peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) of 10%, 25%, 50%, and 75% (the  smaller this ratio is [ie, 10%], the more time the lung is exposed to low  pressure during the release phase, which decreases end-expiratory lung volume and  potentiates derecruitment). Alveolar perimeters were measured at peak inspiration  and end expiration using digital image analysis, and strain was calculated by  normalizing the change in alveolar perimeter length to the original length.  Macrostrain was measured by volume displacement. RESULTS: Higher PEEP (16-24 cm  H2O) and a brief T(low) (APRV T-PEFR to PEFR ratio of 75%) reduced microstrain.  Microstrain was minimized with an APRV T-PEFR to PEFR ratio of 75% (mean [SEM],  0.05 [0.03]) and PEEP of 16 cm H2O (mean [SEM], 0.09 [0.08]), but an APRV T-PEFR  to PEFR ratio of 75% also promoted alveolar recruitment compared with PEEP of 16  cm H2O (mean [SEM] total inspiratory area, 52.0% [2.9%] vs 29.4% [4.3%],  respectively; P < .05). Whole-lung strain was correlated with alveolar  microstrain in tested settings (P < .05) except PEEP of 16 cm H2O (P > .05).  CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Increased positive-end expiratory pressure and reduced  time at low pressure (decreased T(low)) reduced alveolar microstrain. Reduced  microstrain and improved alveolar recruitment using an APRV T-PEFR to PEFR ratio  of 75% may be the mechanism of lung protection seen in previous clinical and  animal studies.

T2  - Lipids in health and disease
AB  - BACKGROUND: N-3 PUFAs have been demonstrated in vitro it could prevent the intestinal tight junctions (TJs) from the ischemia/re-perfusion injury and the  inflammatory reaction injury. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the  protection of n-3 PUFAs on the intestinal TJs in the rat model of hemorrhagic  shock followed by resuscitation. METHODS: Male SD rats (n = 72; 250 ~ 300 g) were  randomly divided into 6 groups: SHAM, hemorrhagic shock (HS), hemorrhagic  shock/resuscitation (HS/R), ω-6 group, ω-3 group and ω-3 treatment group. Shock  was induced, and a mean arterial pressure was maintained at 35 to 40 mmHg for 60  minutes. Resuscitation was carried out by returning half of the shed blood and  Ringer's lactate solution. In ω-6 and ω-3 group, Intralipid or fish oil (0.2  g/Kg), respectively, was infused 30 minutes after shock. And fish oil was infused  with resuscitation in ω-3 treatment group. Half of each group was killed at 30  minutes and 4 hours after resuscitation, respectively. The serum samples and the  intestinal sample was collected for further examination. RESULT: There is no  difference between ω-3, ω-3 treatment and sham group in Chiu's score, but the  other three groups have higher scores than they did. Compared with HS, HSR and  ω-6 group, ω-3 and ω-3 treatment group showed most intact in intestinal mucoscal  villi and TJs through HE, SEM and LSCM. The levels of IL-6 and TNF-α of bowel  tissue in ω-3 and ω-3 treatment group were significantly lower than HS and HSR  groups'. At the time point of 30 min, the levels of serum endotoxin were  dramatically higher in HS、 HSR and ω-6 groups when compared with ω-3, ω-3  treatment and sham group. However, it in ω-3 group was greater than sham and HS  group until 4 hours. CONCLUSION: Fish oil pretreatment before resuscitation  showed a beneficial effect to the intestinal TJs and atteunated inflammation  after H/R in HS/R rat model and is better than ω-6 PUFAs did.

AB  - PURPOSE: We determined whether transfer of a primarily motor nerve (femoral) to the anterior vesicle branch of the pelvic nerve would allow for more effective  bladder reinnervation than transfer of a primarily sensory nerve (genitofemoral).  MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 41 female mongrel dogs underwent bladder  decentralization and then bilateral nerve transfer, or served as sham operated or  unoperated controls. Decentralization was achieved by bilateral transection of  all sacral roots that induced bladder contraction upon electrical stimulation.  Retrograde neuronal labeling dye was injected in the bladder 3 weeks before  sacrifice. RESULTS: Increased detrusor pressure after direct stimulation of the  transferred nerve, lumbar spinal cord or spinal root was observed in 12 of 17  dogs with genitofemoral nerve transfer and in 9 of 10 with femoral nerve transfer  (mean ± SEM 7.6 ± 1.4 and 11.7 ± 3.1 cm H2O, respectively). Mean detrusor  pressure after direct electrical stimulation of transferred femoral nerves was  statistically significantly greater than after stimulation of transferred  genitofemoral nerves. Retrograde labeled neurons from the bladder observed in  upper lumbar cord segments after genitofemoral and femoral nerve transfer  confirmed bladder reinnervation, as did labeled axons at the nerve transfer site.  CONCLUSIONS: While transfer of a mixed sensory and motor nerve (genitofemoral) or  a primarily motor nerve (femoral) can reinnervate the bladder, using the  primarily motor nerve provided greater return of nerve evoked detrusor  contraction. This surgical approach may be useful to achieve bladder emptying in  patients with lower motor spinal cord injury.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The glomerulus contains well-developed capillaries, which are at risk of injury due to high hydrostatic pressure, hyperfiltration, hypertension and  inflammation. However, the pathological alterations of the injured glomerular  basement membrane (GBM), the main component of the glomerular filtration barrier,  are still uncertain in cases of glomerulonephritis. METHODS: We examined the  alterations of the GBM in 50 renal biopsy cases with IgA nephropathy (31.8 ± 17.6  years old) using double immunostaining for the α2(IV) and α5(IV) chains of type  IV collagen, and examining the ultrastructural alterations by transmission  electron microscopy (TEM) and low-vacuum scanning electron microscopy (LV-SEM).  RESULTS: The GBM of IgA nephropathy cases showed various morphological and  qualitative alterations. In the TEM findings, thinning, gaps, rupture, thickening  with a lamellar and reticular structure and double contours were detected in the  GBM. Double immunostaining for α5(IV) and α2(IV) showed thickening of the GBM  with reduced α5(IV) and increased α2(IV), or mosaic images of α5(IV) and α2(IV),  and holes, fractures, spiny projections and rupture of α5(IV) in the GBM. In  addition, LV-SEM showed an etched image and multiple holes in a widening and wavy  GBM. These findings might be associated with the development of a brittle GBM in  IgA nephropathy. CONCLUSION: Glomerular basement membrane alterations were  frequently noted in IgA nephropathy, and were easily evaluated by double  immunostaining for α2(IV) and α5(IV) of type IV collagen and LV-SEM. The  application of these analyses to human renal biopsy specimens may enhance our  understanding of the alterations of the GBM that occur in human glomerular  diseases.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe form and function changes of vascular endothelial cells (VEC) which were transplanted to the posterior surface of rhesus monkey cornea  without Descemet's Membrane by anterior chamber injection, explore the  feasibility of transplanting VEC to treat corneal endothelial injury, and find  new method of corneal endothelial cell transplantation. METHODS: Cultured VEC to  proliferate in vitro.Rhesus monkeys were randomly divided into two groups:  Experimental group (6) and control group (6) according to a random number table.  The experimental group:transplant the culured VEC to the posterior surface of  rhesus monkey cornea without Descemet's membrane by anterior chamber injection.  The control group:Tear out the Descemet's membrane by capsulotomy needle without  VEC transplantation. A ultrasound apparatus was adopted to measure the  postoperative thicknes of the cornea and Goldman intraocular pressure meter  measuring intraocular pressure in the postoperative 7 days, 14 days, 30 days, 60  days, 90 days, organize the data and entered into the computer , applicated the  software of SPSS 11.5 for data independent samples t-test and analysis of  variance. The eyes were removed respectively in postoperative 30, 60, 90 days to  do pathological HE dyeing and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation of  VEC in the posterior surface of cornea graft. RESULTS: Corneal transpareney:In  the experimental observation period (3 months), the experimental group had better  transparency than the control group with normal anterior chamber depth and  without bullous keratopathy. And the corneal neovascularization was exist in the  cornea graft in experimental group in the third month. After 3 months, the  corneal thickness of experimental group (500 ± 14) µm was significantly lower  than the control group (618 ± 11) µm, Corneal thickness values between  experimental and control groups were statistically significant differences in  changes (all P < 0.05, t-values were -3.256, -4.419, -12.896 postoperative 1, 2,  3 months). Changes of intraocular pressure difference between the experimental  group and the control was not statistically significant (all P > 0.05, t-values  were -1.179, -2.166, -2.536 postoperative 1, 2, 3 months). The pathological:the  cell layer was visible in the posterior surface of cornea graft. The control  group:can't find the cell sample structure.SEM:Experimental group showed that VEC  with irregular shape uniformly distributed on the inner surface of cornea and  growing well, a small amount of white blood cells can be seen between VEC, and  part of cellular debris exist in the trabecular meshwork. Control group showed a  fiber material without VEC. CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasonic emulsification can  established a repeatability and simple model of corneal endothelial injury in  Rhesus monkeys.VEC can be transplanted to the corneal surface by Anterior chamber  injection and the cells can grow on the surface and play a barrier role in  maintaining the state of dehydration and transparency of the cornea to a certain  extent. After transplantation, organizational structure and morphology of the  anterior chamber angle does not produce pathological effects in the short term.  Prompt that transplant the culured VEC to the posterior surface of rhesus monkey  cornea without Descemet's Membrane by anterior chamber injection to substitute  the function of the corneal endothelial cells may be a new idea for treatment of  corneal endothelial damage.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Long-term patency of human saphenous veins (HSVs) used as autologous conduits for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) procedures remains limited  because of vein graft failure (VGF). Vein graft failure has been reported to be  as high as 45% at 12 to 18 months after surgery and leads to additional surgery,  myocardial infarction, recurrent angina, and death. Preparation of HSVs before  implantation leads to conduit injury, which may promote VGF. OBJECTIVES: To  investigate whether pressure distension during vein graft preparation leads to  endothelial injury and intimal thickening and whether limiting intraluminal  pressure during pressure distension by using a pressure release valve (PRV)  preserves endothelial function and prevents neointima thickening. DESIGN,  SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Segments of HSVs were collected in a university  hospital from 13 patients undergoing CABG procedures immediately after harvest  (unmanipulated [UM]), after pressure distension (after distension [AD]), and  after typical intraoperative surgical graft preparation (after manipulation  [AM]). Porcine saphenous veins (PSVs) from 7 healthy research animals were  subjected to manual pressure distension with or without an in-line PRV that  prevents pressures of 140 mm Hg or greater. Endothelial function of the HSVs and  PSVs was determined in a muscle bath, endothelial integrity was assessed, and  intimal thickening in PSVs was evaluated after 14 days in organ culture. MAIN  OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Endothelial function was measured in force, converted to  stress, and defined as the percentage relaxation of maximal phenylephrine-induced  contraction. Endothelial integrity was assessed by immunohistologic examination.  Neointimal thickness was measured by histomorphometric analysis. RESULTS:  Pressure distension of HSVs led to decreased mean (SEM) endothelial-dependent  relaxation (5.3% [2.3%] for AD patients vs 13.7% [2.5%] for UM patients; P < .05)  and denudation. In the AM group, the function of the conduits was further  decreased (-3.2% [3.2%]; P < .05). Distension of the PSVs led to reduced  endothelial-dependent relaxation (7.6% [4.4%] vs 61.9% [10.2%] in the control  group; P < .05), denudation, and enhanced intimal thickening (15.0 [1.4] µm vs  2.2 [0.8] µm in the control group; P < .05). Distension with the PRV preserved  endothelial-dependent relaxation (50.3% [9.6%]; P = .32 vs control), prevented  denudation, and reduced intimal thickening (3.4 [0.8] µm; P = .56 vs controls) in  PSVs. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Use of a PRV during graft preparation limits  intraluminal pressure generated by manual distension, preserves endothelial  integrity, and reduces intimal hyperplasia. Integration of this simple device may  contribute to improved long-term vein graft patency.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to the drastic shortage of organ donors, clinicians are increasingly considering the use of deceased after cardiac death donors (DCD).  Compatible solutes like Ectoine and Hydroxyectoine are produced by extremophilic  bacteria as a cell protectant to survive in harsh environments. We hypothesized  that the addition of Hydroxyectoine to Histidine-Tryptophan-Ketoglutarate  solution (HTK) could ameliorate cold ischemic preservation injury of DCD livers.  MATERIAL AND METHODS: Rat livers were harvested from male Wistar rats weighing  250-300 g. Three experimental groups (n=5 per group) were studied: (1) CONTROLS:  cold static storage in HTK for 24 h, (2) DCD: 30-min warm ischemia time and 24-h  cold static storage in HTK, and (3) DCD+Hydroxyectoine: like DCD, but with 24-h  cold static storage in HTK+Hydroxyectoine. Viability of the livers was assessed  after 24 h of preservation by isolated perfusion for 45 min with oxygenated  Krebs-Henseleit buffer solution. RESULTS: (mean ±SEM, Control vs. DCD vs.  DCD+Hydroxyectoine) Parenchymal enzyme release was significantly lower in  DCD+Hydroxyectoine compared to DCD (AST: 9±0.54; 56.8±2.05; 32.2±7.25 U/L, ALT:  9.5±0.5; 37.75±9.6; 17.5±4.17 U/L). Bile production at the end of 45 min  reperfusion was significantly higher in DCD+Hydroxyectoine (5.16±1.32; 1.36±0.34;  10.75±2.24 µL/g liver weight/45 min). Malondialdehyde values were significantly  lower in DCD+Hydroxyectoine (0.8±0.09, 1.14±0.18, 0.77±0.08 nmol/mL).  Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 showed significantly lower values in  DCD+Hydroxyectoine (219.07±51.79, 431.9±35.70, 205.2±37.71 pg/mL) and the portal  venous pressure at 45 min was lower compared to DCD (20.41±0.12, 27.47±0.45,  22.08±0.78 mmHg). CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide evidence for the beneficial role  of Hydroxyectoine-modified HTK solution for the preservation of DCD livers  compared to HTK.

AB  - AIM: To demonstrate the cytotoxic effect of betaxolol and its underlying mechanism on human corneal endothelial cells (HCE cells) in vitro and cat corneal  endothelial cells (CCE cells) in vivo, providing experimental basis for safety  anti-glaucoma drug usage in clinic of ophthalmology. METHODS: In vivo and in  vitro experiments were conducted to explore whether and how betaxolol  participates in corneal endothelial cell injury. The in vitro morphology, growth  status, plasma membrane permeability, DNA fragmentation, and ultrastructure of  HCE cells treated with 0.021875-0.28g/L betaxolol were examined by light  microscope, 3-(4,5)-dimethylthiahiazo (-z-y1)-3,5-di-phenytetrazoliumromide (MTT)  assay, acridine orange (AO)/ethidium bromide (EB) double-fluorescent staining,  DNA agarose gel electrophoresis, and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The  in vivo density, morphology, and ultrastructure of CCE cells, corneal thickness,  and eye pressure of cat eyes treated with 0.28g/L betaxolol were investigated by  specular microscopy, applanation tonometer, alizarin red staining, scanning  electron microscope (SEM), and TEM. RESULTS: Exposure to betaxolol at doses from  0.0875g/L to 2.8g/L induced morphological and ultrastructural changes of in vitro  cultured HCE cells such as cytoplasmic vacuolation, cellular shrinkage,  structural disorganization, chromatin condensation, and apoptotic body  appearance. Simultaneously, betaxolol elevated plasma membrane permeability and  induced DNA fragmentation of these cells in a dose-dependent manner in AO/EB  staining. Furthermore, betaxolol at a dose of 2.8g/L also induced decrease of  density of CCE cells in vivo, and non-hexagonal and shrunk apoptotic cells were  also found in betaxolol-treated cat corneal endothelia. CONCLUSION: Betaxolol has  significant cytotoxicity on HCE cells in vitro by inducing apoptosis of these  cells, and induced apoptosis of CCE cells in vivo as well. The findings help  provide new insight into the apoptosis-inducing effect of anti-glaucoma drugs in  eye clinic.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: A variety of calorie restriction diets and fasting regimens are popular among overweight people. However, starvation could result in unexpected  cardiovascular effects. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the short-term  effects of diets on cardiovascular function, energy metabolism and potential risk  of heart damage in case of myocardial infarction. The objective of the present  study was to investigate whether the increased level of glucose oxidation or  reduction of fatty acid (FA) load in the fed state provides the basis for  protection against myocardial infarction in an experimental rat model of  ischemia-reperfusion. MATERIALS/METHODS: We tested the effects of the  availability of energy substrates and their metabolites on the heart  functionality and energy metabolism under normoxic and ischemia-reperfusion  conditions. RESULTS: In a fasted state, the heart draws energy exclusively from  FAs, whereas in a fed state, higher concentration of circulating insulin ensures  a partial switch to glucose oxidation, while the load of FA on heart and  mitochondria is reduced. Herein, we demonstrate that ischemic damage in hearts  isolated from Wistar rats and diabetic Goto-Kakizaki rats is significantly lower  in the fed state compared to the fasted state. CONCLUSIONS: Present findings  indicate that postprandial or fed-state physiology, which is characterised by  insulin-activated glucose and lactate utilisation, is protective against  myocardial infarction. Energy metabolism pattern in the heart is determined by  insulin signalling and the availability of FAs. Overall, our study suggests that  even overnight fasting could provoke and aggravate cardiovascular events and  high-risk cardiovascular patients should avoid prolonged fasting periods.

AB  - Spontaneous antenatal hypoxia is associated with high risk of adverse outcomes, however, there is little information on neural adaptation to labor-like insults.  Chronically instrumented near-term sheep fetuses (125 ± 3 days, mean ± SEM) with  baseline PaO2 < 17 mmHg (hypoxic group: n = 8) or > 17 mmHg (normoxic group: n =  8) received 1-minute umbilical cord occlusions repeated every 5 minutes for a  total of 4 hours, or until mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) fell below 20 mmHg  for two successive occlusions. 5/8 fetuses with pre-existing hypoxia were unable  to complete the full series of occlusions (vs. 0/8 normoxic fetuses).  Pre-existing hypoxia was associated with progressive metabolic acidosis (nadir:  pH 7.08 ± 0.04 vs. 7.33 ± 0.02, p<0.01), hypotension during occlusions (nadir:  24.7 ± 1.8 vs. 51.4 ± 3.2 mmHg, p<0.01), lower carotid blood flow during  occlusions (23.6 ± 6.1 vs. 63.0 ± 4.8 mL/min, p<0.01), greater suppression of EEG  activity during, between, and after occlusions (p<0.01) and slower resolution of  cortical impedance, an index of cytotoxic edema. No normoxic fetuses, but 4/8  hypoxic fetuses developed seizures 148 ± 45 minutes after the start of  occlusions, with a seizure burden of 26 ± 6 sec during the inter-occlusion  period, and 15.1 ± 3.4 min/h in the first 6 hours of recovery. In conclusion, in  fetuses with pre-existing hypoxia, repeated brief asphyxia at a rate consistent  with early labor is associated with hypotension, cephalic hypoperfusion, greater  EEG suppression, inter-occlusion seizures, and more sustained cytotoxic edema,  consistent with early onset of neural injury.

AB  - PURPOSE: Focused ultrasonic propulsion is a new noninvasive technique designed to move kidney stones and stone fragments out of the urinary collecting system.  However, to our knowledge the extent of tissue injury associated with this  technique is not known. We quantitated the amount of tissue injury produced by  focused ultrasonic propulsion under simulated clinical treatment conditions and  under conditions of higher power or continuous duty cycles. We compared those  results to extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy injury. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A  human calcium oxalate monohydrate stone and/or nickel beads were implanted by  ureteroscopy in 3 kidneys of live pigs weighing 45 to 55 kg and repositioned  using focused ultrasonic propulsion. Additional pig kidneys were exposed to  extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy level pulse intensity or continuous  ultrasound exposure 10 minutes in duration using an ultrasound probe  transcutaneously or on the kidney. These kidneys were compared to 6 treated with  an unmodified Dornier HM3 lithotripter (Dornier Medical Systems, Kennesaw,  Georgia) using 2,400 shocks at 120 shock waves per minute and 24 kV. Histological  analysis was performed to assess the volume of hemorrhagic tissue injury created  by each technique according to the percent of functional renal volume. RESULTS:  Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy produced a mean ± SEM lesion of 1.56% ±  0.45% of functional renal volume. Ultrasonic propulsion produced no detectable  lesion with simulated clinical treatment. A lesion of 0.46% ± 0.37% or 1.15% ±  0.49% of functional renal volume was produced when excessive treatment parameters  were used with the ultrasound probe placed on the kidney. CONCLUSIONS: Focused  ultrasonic propulsion produced no detectable morphological injury to the renal  parenchyma when using clinical treatment parameters but produced injury  comparable in size to that of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy when using  excessive treatment parameters.

AB  - Hypertrophic scarring (HS) has been considered as a great concern for patients and a challenging problem for clinicians as it can be cosmetically disfiguring  and functionally debilitating. In this study, Ginsenoside Rg3/Poly(l-lactide)  (G-Rg3/PLLA) electrospun fibrous scaffolds covering on the full-thickness skin  excisions location was designed to suppress the hypertrophic scar formation in  vivo. SEM and XRD results indicated that the crystal G-Rg3 carried in PLLA  electrospun fibers was in amorphous state, which facilitates the solubility of  G-Rg3 in the PLLA electrospun fibrous scaffolds, and solubility of G-Rg3 in PBS  is increased from 3.2 µg/ml for pure G-Rg3 powders to 19.4 µg/ml for incorporated  in PLLA-10% fibers. The released G-Rg3 content in the physiological medium could  be further altered from 324 to 3445 µg in a 40-day release period by adjusting  the G-Rg3 incorporation amount in PLLA electrospun fibers. In vitro results  demonstrated that electrospun G-Rg3/PLLA fibrous scaffold could significantly  inhibit fibroblast cell growth and proliferation. In vivo results confirmed that  the G-Rg3/PLLA electrospun fibrous scaffold showed significant improvements in  terms of dermis layer thickness, fibroblast proliferation, collagen fibers and  microvessels, revealing that the incorporation of the G-Rg3 in the fibers  prevented the HS formation. The above results demonstrate the potential use of  G-Rg3/PLLA electrospun fibrous scaffolds to rapidly minimize fibroblast growth  and restore the structural and functional properties of wounded skin for patients  with deep trauma, severe burn injury, and surgical incision.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mechanical ventilation is a life-saving intervention for patients with respiratory failure. Unfortunately, a major complication associated with  prolonged mechanical ventilation is ventilator-induced diaphragmatic atrophy and  contractile dysfunction, termed ventilator-induced diaphragmatic dysfunction  (VIDD). Emerging evidence suggests that positive pressure ventilation (PPV)  promotes lung damage (ventilator-induced lung injury [VILI]), resulting in the  release of signaling molecules that foster atrophic signaling in the diaphragm  and the resultant VIDD. Although a recent report suggests that negative pressure  ventilation (NPV) results in less VILI than PPV, it is unknown whether NPV can  protect against VIDD. Therefore, the authors tested the hypothesis that compared  with PPV, NPV will result in a lower level of VIDD. METHODS: Adult rats were  randomly assigned to one of three experimental groups (n = 8 each): (1) acutely  anesthetized control (CON), (2) 12 h of PPV, and (3) 12 h of NPV. Dependent  measures included indices of VILI, diaphragmatic muscle fiber cross-sectional  area, diaphragm contractile properties, and the activity of key proteases in the  diaphragm. RESULTS: Our results reveal that no differences existed in the degree  of VILI between PPV and NPV animals as evidenced by VILI histological scores (CON  = 0.082 ± 0.001; PPV = 0.22 ± 0.04; NPV = 0.25 ± 0.02; mean ± SEM). Both PPV and  NPV resulted in VIDD. Importantly, no differences existed between PPV and NPV  animals in diaphragmatic fiber cross-sectional area, contractile properties, and  the activation of proteases. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that NPV and  PPV result in similar levels of VILI and that NPV and PPV promote comparable  levels of VIDD in rats.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hemorrhagic shock and subsequent resuscitation can lead to ischemia-reperfusion injury, followed by multiorgan failure and death. Flutamide,  a vasoactive nonsteroidal antiandrogen compound, is thought to improve tissue and  organ perfusion. We tested whether administration of flutamide-cyclodextrin  (FLU-CYD) alters physiologic parameters or resuscitation requirements in a  porcine model of severe acidosis and shock secondary to combined  hemorrhage + ischemia-reperfusion injury. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fifteen male  pigs underwent a 35% blood-volume hemorrhage. Ischemia was induced by  cross-clamping the supraceliac aorta for 50 min followed by reperfusion and  resuscitation. FLU-CYD complex was administered during aortic clamping. Fluid  resuscitation and epinephrine were titrated by protocol to maintain mean arterial  pressure ≥40 mm Hg for 6 h. Sequential laboratory results were obtained and serum  levels of FLU and 2-hydroxy-flutamide (FLUOH) were measured by mass spectrometry.  RESULTS: Mean requirements for injured control swine were 14.6 (± 1.21 standard  error of the mean [SEM]) L crystalloid saline and 0.59 (± 0.29 SEM) g  epinephrine, compared with 16.30 (± 1.33 SEM) L and 0.54 (± 0.16 SEM) g,  respectively, in the FLU-CYD group (both P > 0.05). There were no significant  differences in central hemodynamics between control and experimental groups. No  significant differences for pH, bicarbonate, fibrinogen, or international  normalized ratio were evident. FLU-CYD resuscitation was associated with a  significant increase in lactate levels compared with controls (10.1 versus 5.7  mmol/L, P < 0.05). Histologic injury was significantly increased in the livers of  FLU-CYD compared with sham (P = 0.022). High serum levels of FLU and the active  metabolite FLUOH were measurable throughout the resuscitation period.  CONCLUSIONS: Flutamide failed to show any benefit to resuscitation in a model of  severe injury and was associated with increased acidosis, hemodilution, and liver  injury compared with standard crystalloid resuscitation.

TI  - Sensory and sensorimotor features in violinists and violists with neck pain.
AU  - Steinmetz, Anke
AU  - Jull, Gwendolen A.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate sensory and sensorimotor function in violin and viola players with and without neck pain. DESIGN: Prospective, cross-sectional study.  SETTING: University laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Convenience sample of violin  players with playing-related neck pain (n=22), violinists without neck pain  (n=21), and healthy nonmusician comparison subjects (n=21). INTERVENTIONS: Not  applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Measures include thermal pain thresholds (cold  and heat) and pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) over the cervical spine and over a  remote region (tibialis anterior muscle). Motor performance tests including  reaction times, speed of movement, accuracy, coordination, and tapping speed  assessed with a special upper-limb test battery. RESULTS: Musicians with neck  pain had significantly lower heat and elevated cold pain thresholds as well as  lower PPTs over C5-6 (P<.01) and over the tibialis anterior (P<.05). Motor  performance tests revealed no differences between the symptomatic and  asymptomatic musicians and nonmusician comparison groups (P>.05). CONCLUSIONS:  Violin players with neck pain demonstrated signs of sensory impairment,  suggesting that playing-related neck pain may be associated with augmented  central pain processing consistent with findings in other neck pain groups. No  differences were evident in the motor performance tests. Fine motor skills of  violin players may be better assessed in the context of playing their musical  instruments before definitive conclusions can be drawn about the presence or not  of sensorimotor impairments in this group of musicians with playing-related neck  pain.

AB  - In nanomedicine, different nanomaterials and nanoparticles have been proposed as therapeutic agents or adjuvants, as well as diagnosis devices. Considering that  the principal cause of the ulcerations is the imbalance among the gastric juice  secretion and the protection provided by the mucosal barrier and the  neutralization of the gastric acid, as well as that nanoparticles are able to  accumulate in the gastro-intestinal tissues, we proposed a 2(2) factorial design  to evaluate the influence of the chemical composition and the volume fraction of  the dispersed phase on the gastric protective effect against ulceration induced  by ethanol. Cocoa-theospheres (CT) and lipid-core nanocapsules (LNC) (two  different kinds of surfaces: lipid and polymeric, respectively) prepared at two  different concentrations of soft materials: 4% and 12% (w/v) were produced by  high pressure homogenization and solvent displacement methods, respectively.  Laser diffraction showed volume-weighted mean diameters ranging from 133 to 207  nm, number median diameters lower than 100 nm and specific surfaces between 41.2  and 51.2 m(2) g(-1). The formulations had pH ranging from 4.7 to 6.3; and zeta  potential close to -9 mV due to their coating with polysorbate 80. The ulcer  indexes were 0.40 (LNC(4)) and 0.48 (CT(4)) for the lower total administered  areas (3.3 and 4.1 m(2)g(-1), respectively), and 0.09 (LNC(12) and CT(12)) for  the higher administered areas (10.0 and 12.0 m(2) g(-1), respectively). LNC(4),  LNC(12) and CT(12) showed lower levels in the lipid peroxidation assay when  compared either to the negative control (saline) or to CT(4). LNC(12) and CT(12)  showed similar TBARS levels, as well as CT(4) was similar to the negative  control. SEM analysis of the stomach mucosa showed coatings more homogenous and  cohesive when LNC formulations were administered compared to the correspondent CT  formulations. The higher total area of administered nanoparticles showed film  formation. Moreover, LNC(12) provided a more thick and cohesive film, completely  covering the mucosal surface. In conclusion, both kinds of formulations are able  to prevent ulceration induced by ethanol in rats. The 2(2) factorial design  showed that the chemical composition had a strong influence when the lower areas  of nanoparticles are administered, while when the higher areas are used this is  the more influencing parameter on the gastroprotection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Modern high volume-low pressure (HVLP) endotracheal tubes (ETT) cuffs can seal the trachea using baseline cuff pressures (CP) lower than peak  inspiratory airway pressures (PIP). The aim of the study was to determine whether  this technique reduces the damage to the tracheal mucosa compared to constant CP  of 20 cmH(2)O. METHODS: Eighteen piglets were intubated with an ID 4.0 mm HVLP  cuffed ETT (Microcuff PET) and artificially ventilated with 20 cmH(2)O PIP and 5  cmH(2)O PEEP. Animals were randomly allocated to two groups of CP: group A (just  seal; n = 9) and group B (20 cmH(2)O; n = 9), controlled constantly with a  manometer during the following 4-h study period under sevoflurane anesthesia.  After euthanasia, cuff position was marked in situ. Damage in the cuff region was  evaluated with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) examination by grading of  mucosal damage and by estimating percentage of intact mucosal area both by a  blinded observer. RESULTS: Maximal CP to seal the trachea in group A ranged from  12 to 18 cmH(2)O (median: 14 cmH(2)O). Using a mixed effects model approach, the  estimated mean effect of group B vs group A was an increase of 17.9% (SE 8.1%)  higher proportion of pictures with an area of at least 5% intact mucosa (P =  0.042). CONCLUSION: Minimal sealing pressures with cyclic pressure changes from  CP did not result in decreased damage to the tracheal mucosa compared to constant  CP of 20 cmH(2)O in this short-term animal trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Paracetamol is a cornerstone for perioperative pain relief. Its mechanism of action may include a local anti-inflammatory effect with inhibition  of cyclooxygenase isoenzymes. The scarce literature available on its effects on  wound healing consists of preclinical studies into the effect of paracetamol on  healing of the musculoskeletal system. Although the drug is used abundantly for  pain relief after surgery of the gastrointestinal tract, there are no published  data on the influence of paracetamol on anastomotic and abdominal healing. This  also holds for the crucial, early inflammatory phase of repair. The recovery of  wound strength could therefore conceivably be affected by paracetamol. METHODS:  In 78 male Wistar rats, we constructed an anastomosis in colon and ileum. The  rats received either low- or high-dose (50 or 200 mg/kg/d, divided over 2 doses)  paracetamol or vehicle (controls) until they were killed on day 3 or 7 after  surgery (n = 13 each). In anastomoses, the main outcome variables were 2  independent measures for wound strength, bursting pressure, and breaking  strength, the latter being the primary outcome variable. In addition, collagen  levels were measured and histology was performed. In fascia, breaking strength  was analyzed. RESULTS: No significant differences were found between control and  paracetamol-treated groups at any time point for any of the variables. Wound  strength increased significantly from day 3 to day 7 in all groups. In the colon  anastomosis, the breaking strength increased from 130 ± 9 g (mean ± SEM) at day 3  to 232 ± 17 g at day 7 in the control group, from 144 ± 10 to 224 ± 9 g in the  low-dose group, and from 130 ± 12 to 263 ± 28 g in the high-dose group. The lower  limit for the 95% confidence interval was -11 for the difference between control  and low-dose groups at day 3 and -25 for the difference between control and  high-dose groups. No differences in collagen levels were found between the  high-dose and control groups. Histology did not indicate the presence of gross  differences between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative use of paracetamol in a  rat model of intestinal surgery does not significantly impede wound repair in the  early postoperative period.

AB  - PURPOSE: Most animal models of stress urinary incontinence simulate maternal injuries of childbirth since delivery is a major risk factor but they do not  reproduce the nerve stretch known to occur during human childbirth. We  hypothesized that pudendal nerve stretch produces reversible dysfunction of the  external urethral sphincter. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Female virgin Sprague-Dawley®  rats were anesthetized with urethane. Bilateral pudendal nerve stretch or sham  injury was performed for 5 minutes. External urethral sphincter electromyography  and leak point pressure were recorded immediately before and after, and 10, 30,  60 and 120 minutes after pudendal nerve stretch. Post-pudendal nerve stretch  results were compared to prestretch values and to values in sham injured animals.  The pudendal nerves underwent qualitative histological assessment. The nucleus of  Onuf was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and polymerase chain reaction for  β-APP and c-Fos expression as markers of neuronal activity and injury. RESULTS: A  total of 14 rats underwent bilateral pudendal nerve stretch (9) or sham injury  (5). Each nerve was stretched a mean ± SEM of 74% ± 18% on the left side and 63%  ± 13% on the right side. Electromyography amplitude decreased significantly  immediately after stretch compared to before stretch and after sham injury (p =  0.003) but it recovered by 30 minutes after stretch. There was no significant  change in leak point pressure at any time. Two hours after injury histology  showed occasional neuronal degeneration. β-APP and c-Fos expression was similar  in the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Acute pudendal nerve stretch produces reversible  electrophysiological dysfunction but without leak point pressure impairment.  Pudendal nerve stretch shows promise in modeling injury. It should be tested as  part of a multi-injury, chronic, physiological model of human childbirth injury.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We have recently shown that postischemic administration of intralipid protects the heart against ischemia-reperfusion injury. Here we compared the  cardioprotective effects of intralipid with cyclosporine-A, a potent inhibitor of  the mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening. METHODS: In vivo rat  hearts or isolated Langendorff-perfused mouse hearts were subjected to ischemia  followed by reperfusion with intralipid (0.5%, 1% and 2% ex-vivo, and 20% in  vivo), cyclosporine-A (0.2 μM, 0.8 μM, and 1.5 μM ex- vivo and 10 mg/kg in vivo),  or vehicle. The hemodynamic function, infarct size, calcium retention capacity,  mitochondrial superoxide production, and phosphorylation levels of protein kinase  B (Akt)/glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) were measured. The values are mean ±  SEM. RESULTS: Administration of intralipid at reperfusion significantly reduced  myocardial infarct size compared with cyclosporine-A in vivo (infarct size/area  at risk)%: 22.9 ± 2.5% vs. 35.2 ± 3.5%; P = 0.030, n = 7/group). Postischemic  administration of intralipid at its optimal dose (1%) was more effective than  cyclosporine-A (0.8 μM) in protecting the ex vivo heart against  ischemia-reperfusion injury, as the rate pressure product at the end of  reperfusion was significantly higher (mmHg · beats/min: 12,740 ± 675 [n = 7] vs.  9,203 ± 10,781 [n = 5], P = 0.024), and the infarct size was markedly smaller  (17.3 ± 2.9 [n = 7] vs. 29.2 ± 2.7 [n = 5], P = 0.014). Intralipid was as  efficient as cyclosporine-A in inhibiting the mitochondrial permeability  transition pore opening (calcium retention capacity = 280 ± 8.2 vs. 260.3 ± 2.9  nmol/mg mitochondria protein in cyclosporine-A, P = 0.454, n = 6) and in reducing  cardiac mitochondrial superoxide production. Unlike intralipid, which increased  phosphorylation of Akt (6-fold) and GSK-3β (5-fold), cyclosporine-A had no effect  on the activation of these prosurvival kinases. CONCLUSIONS: Although intralipid  inhibits the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore as  efficiently as cyclosporine-A, intralipid is more effective in reducing the  infarct size and improving the cardiac functional recovery.

AB  - AIM: GLP-1(7-36)amide (GLP-1) is an intestinal hormone with effects on glucose metabolism and feeding behavior, including insulinotropic, insulinomimetic,  glucagonostatic and anorectic actions. In experimental settings, GLP-1 has also  been shown to diminish infarct size following heart ischemia-reperfusion. GLP-1  analogs with extended half-lives are continuously being developed against type 2  diabetes mellitus. Of these, only exendin-4 (exenatide, registered as Byetta) has  been shown to mimic the infarct size-limiting effect of GLP-1 in a clinically  relevant application as a postconditioning agent. The aim of this work was to  test, in a postconditioning mode, a novel, proteolysis-resistant GLP-1 analog  N-Ac-GLP-1(7-34)amide, herein termed curaglutide, for its cardioprotective  ability. METHOD: Global ischemia (35 min)-reperfusion (120 min) was applied in  isolated, retrogradely perfused rat hearts. Peptides were present for 15 min at  the onset of reperfusion. Cardiac function parameters (beats per minute, left  ventricle developed and diastolic pressures, rate-pressure product) were  measured. Infarct size was determined by 2,3,5-tripehyltetrazolium chloride  staining and planimetry. RESULTS: Curaglutide did not affect any of the  functional heart parameters when administered without preceding ischemia.  Curaglutide 0.3 nM diminished significantly the postischemic hypercontracture,  with no significant effect on the left ventricle developed pressure or  rate-pressure product. Infarct size was reduced by curaglutide postconditioning  from 24.8% (SEM 2.8, N=14) to 11.4% (SEM 3.2, N=8; P<0.05). These effects of  curaglutide on postischemic hypercontracture and infarct size were similar in  magnitude to corresponding effects of GLP-1 receptor agonist exendin-4. The  cardioprotective effects of both agents were abolished in the presence of a GLP-1  receptor antagonist exendin(9-39). CONCLUSION: Curaglutide is a new,  proteolysis-resistant GLP-1 analog with a beneficial effect on reperfusion-injury  in an isolated rat heart. Curaglutide was here shown to act through GLP-1  receptors. Based on the present results, more extensive experimental studies in  vivo, comparing dose-response characteristics and efficacy of curaglutide and  exendin-4 appear warranted.

AB  - We recently demonstrated that reducing IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) numbers in the endothelium enhances nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability and endothelial cell  insulin sensitivity. In the present report, we aimed to examine the effect of  increasing IGF-1R on endothelial cell function and repair. To examine the effect  of increasing IGF-1R in the endothelium, we generated mice overexpressing human  IGF-1R in the endothelium (human IGF-1R endothelium-overexpressing mice  [hIGFREO]) under direction of the Tie2 promoter enhancer. hIGFREO aorta had  reduced basal NO bioavailability (percent constriction to  N(G)-monomethyl-l-arginine [mean (SEM) wild type 106% (30%); hIGFREO 48% (10%)];  P < 0.05). Endothelial cells from hIGFREO had reduced insulin-stimulated  endothelial NO synthase activation (mean [SEM] wild type 170% [25%], hIGFREO 58%  [3%]; P = 0.04) and insulin-stimulated NO release (mean [SEM] wild type 4,500 AU  [1,000], hIGFREO 1,500 AU [700]; P < 0.05). hIGFREO mice had enhanced endothelium  regeneration after denuding arterial injury (mean [SEM] percent recovered area,  wild type 57% [2%], hIGFREO 47% [5%]; P < 0.05) and enhanced endothelial cell  migration in vitro. The IGF-1R, although reducing NO bioavailability, enhances in  situ endothelium regeneration. Manipulating IGF-1R in the endothelium may be a  useful strategy to treat disorders of vascular growth and repair.

TI  - Cardioprotection with esmolol cardioplegia: efficacy as a blood-based solution.
AU  - Fujii, Masahiro

T2  - European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Current cardiac surgery patients are older, sicker, with more diffuse disease and hence a reduced tolerance to ischaemia-reperfusion injury. We  previously demonstrated that esmolol, an ultra-short-acting β-blocker, can be  used as an arresting agent at high (millimolar) concentrations, and that a  crystalloid-based esmolol cardioplegia afforded cardioprotection at least  equivalent to hyperkalaemic (St Thomas' Hospital) cardioplegia. Esmolol is  rapidly metabolized by blood esterases, so it was important to determine the  feasibility of its use in blood-based solutions. This study compared the efficacy  of blood-based esmolol cardioplegia with hyperkalaemic cardioplegia in a novel  blood-perfused rat heart preparation. METHODS: Isolated rat hearts were  Langendorff blood-perfused with a rat blood/buffer perfusate mixture (flow rate,  3.0 ml/min) and pre-ischaemic baseline function (left ventricular developed  pressure) assessed. All values are expressed as mean ± SEM. Three studies were  conducted: (i) the efficacy of blood-based vs crystalloid-based esmolol or  hyperkalaemic cardioplegia (40 min ischaemia) was evaluated (five groups; six  hearts/group); (ii) the effect of the mode of cardioplegia delivery (constant  flow/pressure), esmolol concentration and extended delivery interval (45 min  ischaemia) was evaluated (four groups; six hearts/group); (iii) the efficacy of  blood-based esmolol compared with hyperkalaemic cardioplegia over extended (60  min) ischaemia duration was evaluated (two groups; six hearts/group). Hearts were  reperfused (60 min) and recovery (percent of pre-ischaemic baseline function)  measured at the end of reperfusion. RESULTS: Hearts subjected to blood-based  esmolol or hyperkalaemia cardioplegia recovered to 78 ± 4% and 68 ± 6%, whereas  crystalloid-based esmolol or hyperkalaemic cardioplegia recovered to 84 ± 1% and  77 ± 2%, respectively [all P < 0.05 vs control (2 ± 2%)]; there were no  differences between cardioplegia groups. When infusion duration was extended, a  lower (2 mmol/l) esmolol concentration improved recovery compared with the higher  (3 mmol/l) concentration (66 ± 4% vs 29 ± 12%, P < 0.05). Extending the ischaemic  duration demonstrated enhanced efficacy for blood-based esmolol cardioplegia (70  ± 4%; P < 0.05) compared with hyperkalaemic cardioplegia (47 ± 10%). CONCLUSIONS:  Blood-based esmolol cardioplegia improved cardioprotective efficacy compared with  hyperkalaemic cardioplegia; the metabolic effects of blood esterase did not  appear to influence this efficacy. An esmolol-based cardioplegic solution may be  a beneficial alternative to hyperkalaemic solutions.

AB  - In the developing brain agents clinically used for the purpose of analgosedation can cause severe neurodegeneration. In patients with TBI analgosedation is a  first-line treatment for intracranial hypertension. At the same time, damaged  neuronal networks undergo conformational changes and use developmental mechanisms  to restore brain function. Inhibition of repair mechanisms by sedatives may cause  brain dysfunction and neuronal cell death during development and after traumatic  brain injury. To test this hypothesis, the influence of sedation was  experimentally evaluated in a controlled cortical impact injury model (CCII). One  experimental group was preconditioned with regular sedation (isoflurane 1.0  MAC(50)) and the second group with deep sedation (isoflurane 1.67 MAC(50)). After  controlled cortical impact injury (CCII) we tested the outcome at 4 h and 48 h  using histological methods and a neurological test. Increased apoptosis was found  in referenced cortical areas as early as 48 h after trauma (TUNEL-positive  cells/field of view, mean ± SEM, 116.6 ± 9.3 and 45.3 ± 4.1, both n = 12). Along  with histological findings neurological outcome was worst as indicated by a  higher score in the experimental group with deep sedation (mean ± SEM 4 h, 13.9 ±  0.6, n = 14 and 20 ± 0.7, n = 15; 48 h, 8.1 ± 0.6, n = 14 and 13.3 ± 0.6, n =  15). Although blood pressure was lower with deep sedation, no frank hypotension  occurred. In our experiments deep sedation with high doses of isoflurane caused  neurodegeneration and worse outcome compared with regular sedation.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) is believed to play a crucial role in lung ischaemia-reperfusion injury (LIRI). Ischaemic  preconditioning (IP) has been shown to protect several organs from  ischaemia-reperfusion (IR) injury, although less is known about IP's effect on  MCP-1 modulation. The objective of this study was to investigate IP's effect on  MCP-1 expression in lung tissue and its relationship with oxidative stress and  proinflammatory cytokine production in an experimental LIRI model. METHODS: Two  groups (IP and control groups) of seven large white pigs underwent a lung  autotransplant (left pneumonectomy, ex situ superior lobectomy and lower lobe  reimplantation). Before pneumonectomy was performed in the study group, IP was  induced with two cycles of 5 min of left pulmonary artery occlusion with a 5 min  interval of reperfusion between the two occlusions. Blood samples and lung  biopsies were obtained at prepneumonectomy (PPn), at prereperfusion (PRp) and up  to 30 min after reperfusion of the implanted lobe (Rp-10' and Rp-30').  Haemodynamic and blood-gas measurements, evaluation of oxidative stress in lung  tissue and MCP-1, tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and IL-1 protein and mRNA  measurements in lung tissue were performed. Nonparametric tests were used to  compare differences between groups. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. RESULTS: In  control lungs, MCP-1 protein levels were found to be higher at PRp, Rp-10' and  Rp-30' than at PPn (0.59 ± 0.1 vs. 0.21 ± 0.05, 0.47 ± 0.01 vs. 0.21 ± 0.05 and  0.56 ± 0.01 vs. 0.21 ± 0.05, respectively; P < 0.05). These differences were not  evident in the IP group. MCP-1 levels at PRp, Rp-10' and Rp-30' were  significantly higher in the control group than in the IP group (0.59 ± 0.1 vs.  0.15 ± 0.02, 0.47 ± 0.01 vs. 0.13 ± 0.01 and 0.56 ± 0.01 vs. 0.27 ± 0.01,  respectively; P < 0.05). MCP-1, TNF-α and IL-1 mRNA expressions were lower at  PRp, Rp-10' and Rp-30' (control vs. IP group, P < 0.05) when IP was carried out.  Lipid peroxidation metabolites and myeloperoxidase activity increase in lung  tissue were prevented by IP. CONCLUSIONS: In this model, LIRI induced the  expression of MCP-1 and the proinflammatory proteins TNF-α and IL-1 in control  lungs. IP significantly reduced the expression of these chemokines and cytokines.  These features may explain the reduction of oxidative stress observed with IP.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Persons with spinal cord injury (SCI) are at high risk for pressure ulcers (PrUs) throughout their lifetime due to decreased mobility, lack of  sensation, and other physiological changes. The high prevalence and recurrence  rates, and costs associated with PrUs in veterans with SCI indicate the need for  a reliable and practical method of detecting early PrUs. OBJECTIVE: To assess the  feasibility of obtaining biophysical measures of sub-epidermal moisture (SEM)  using a handheld dermal phase meter to predict PrUs. DESIGN/METHODS: Prospective  observational design. Thirty-four veterans at two VA SCI centers (Hines, Long  Beach) received daily (n = 12) or weekly (n = 22) SEM and concurrent visual skin  assessment (VSA) across nine anatomic locations for up to 6 weeks. Outcome  measures: SEM, visual skin assessment (VSA), and stage I PrUs. FINDINGS/RESULTS:  SEM was lowest for normal skin (39.3 dermal phase units (DPU), SD = 12.6) and  higher for erythema/stage 1 PrUs (40.8 DPU, SD = 10.4) across all anatomic sites.  Buttocks SEM were different between normal skin (40.5 DPU, SD = 10.3) and  erythema/stage1 PrUs (43.8, SD = 9.5). SEM taken at heels were lower across all  skin conditions (normal skin 28.2 DPU; erythema/stage 1 PrUs 34.7 DPU). SEM was  taken when generalized edema present was lower than without generalized edema.  CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary results of using SEM to detect early PrU damage may  translate from nursing home (NH) residents to persons with SCI. This study  provides a foundation for a larger study to implement and assess SEM use as a  method of prevention of PrUs.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine if serum levels of skeletal troponin I (sTnI, fast and slow isoforms) could provide a sensitive marker of respiratory  muscle damage in healthy humans subjected to inspiratory loads. To accomplish  this, we studied healthy, young (27 ± 2 years, Mean ± SEM, n = 5) and middle-aged  (55 ± 5, n = 5) men to (1) determine the magnitude, pattern, and time course of  the presence of sTnI in the serum after a single 60 min bout of inspiratory  threshold loading [ITL, ~70% of maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP)], (2)  determine the distribution and magnitude of DOMS after loading, and (3) compare  fast and slow sTnI levels, and their relationship to other markers/indices of  muscle injury including delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS), serum creatine  kinase (CK) levels, and force generating capacity of the respiratory muscles [MIP  and maximal expiratory pressure (MEP)]. There was a 24 ± 4 and 27 ± 3% increase  in fast sTnI 1 hour (p < 0.01) and 3 days (p < 0.01) after ITL. Slow sTnI was  elevated by 24 ± 10% (p < 0.05) 4 days postITL. Other indices of respiratory  muscle injury such as CK, MIP and MEP did not show a difference in mean data  following ITL; DOMS was slightly but significantly increased following ITL. Our  results suggest that sTnI has superior sensitivity compared to other  biomarkers/indices of skeletal muscle injury. Future studies examining the impact  of respiratory muscle injury with ventilator weaning should consider using sTnI  as a sensitive marker of skeletal muscle injury.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To better define urethral catheter balloon pressures and extraction forces during traumatic placement and removal of urethral catheters. To help  guide design for safer urethral catheters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Measurements of  balloon pressure were made upon filling within the urethra vs the bladder.  Extraction forces were measured upon removal of a catheter with a filled balloon  from the bladder. Models for the bladder and urethra included an ex vivo model  (funnel, 'bladder', attached to a 30 F tube, 'urethra') and fresh human male  cadavers. The mean (SEM) balloon pressures and extraction forces were calculated.  RESULTS: In the ex vivo model, the mean (SEM) pressures upon filling the balloon  with 10 mL were on average three-times higher within the ex vivo'urethra' (177  [6] kPa) vs 'bladder' (59 [2] kPa) across multiple catheter types. In the human  cadaver, the mean balloon pressure was 1.9-times higher within the urethra (139  [11] kPa) vs bladder (68 [4] kPa). Balloon pressure increased non-linearly during  intraurethral filling of both models, resulting in either balloon rupture  (silicone catheters) or 'ballooning' of the neck of the balloon filling port  (latex catheters). Removal of a filled balloon per the ex vivo model 'urethra'  and cadaveric urethra, similarly required increasing force with greater balloon  fill volumes (e.g. 9.34 [0.44] N for 5 mL vs 41.37 [8.01] N for 10 mL balloon  volume). CONCLUSIONS: Iatrogenic complications from improper urethral catheter  use is common. Catheter balloon pressures and manual extraction forces associated  with urethral injury are significantly greater than those found with normal use.  The differences in pressure and force may be incorporated into a safer urethral  catheter design, which may significantly reduce iatrogenic urethral injury  associated with catheterization.

T2  - Journal of science and medicine in sport
AB  - Patellar tendinopathy is a common and often difficult to treat overuse injury which is characterized by activity-related anterior knee and focal palpation  tenderness of the patellar tendon. The clinical diagnosis is mainly based on  clinical examination, in which the yardstick is a non-standardized manual  palpation. To standardize this palpation procedure the use of an algometer seems  applicable. The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility and  reliability of the algometer in patellar tendinopathy. A cross sectional study  was carried out.The algometer was applied to the patellar tendon in 20  asymptomatic volleyball players to measure the 'normal' pressure pain threshold.  The inter-rater reliability was analyzed in 54 athletes with symptomatic patellar  tendinopathy, the intra-rater reliability was analyzed in 48 athletes with  symptomatic patellar tendinopathy. During the procedure difficulties were  described, the SEM, intra class correlations and limits of agreement were  determined using the Bland and Altman method. The feasibility of the algometer is  adequate. The PPT of asymptomatic athletes differs significantly (p<.001) from  athletes with a diagnosis of patellar tendinopathy. The inter-rater (ICC 0.93)  and intra-rater (ICC 0.60) reliability of the pain pressure threshold are  adequate to moderate. Although further research is warranted PPT algometry seems  to be a feasible, reliable and useful tool in the diagnosis and treatment  evaluation of athletes with patellar tendinopathy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of pressure bionic culture on the morphology and function of rabbit corneal endothelial cells. METHODS: Corneal endothelial  cells were separated and purified by tearing apart the descemet and digesting  with trypsin and EDTA, then cultured in the plate. The cells were divided into  two groups: group A were cultured under atmosphere; cells exposed to 2 kPa (14.66  mm Hg) pressure in vitro was group B; the morphology and growth pattern of cells  were observed by inverted microscope; cells origin were identified by  neuron-specific enolase immunoassay. Cellular changes in the structure were  observed by HE staining and scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM  and TEM) analysis. Cells activity was detected by flow cytometry. RESULTS: NSE  antibody of the primary corneal endothelial cells was positive without corneal  epithelial cells and corneal stroma cells. Two groups of cells were cultured for  120-144 h respectively, the morphology was flat, polygon, most of cells were  hexagon and abundant cytoplasms in group B (pressure bionic culture), but in  group A, the cells size was not uniform and there were much granules in the  cytoplasm. There was no difference in the time of formation of monolayer in two  groups. SEM showed that cells exposed to pressure connected tightly and the  surface was rich in microvilli, extended foot processes and attached to the  substrate tightly, while cells cultured under atmosphere with more off-chip. In  group B, Annexin-FITC/PI detection of apoptosis showed cell survival rate was  98.2%, early apoptosis rate was 0.7%, late apoptosis rate was 1.0%, death rate  was 0.1%; the corresponding data were 92.2%, 5.2%, 2.3%, and 0.3% in group A,  respectively; There was statistically significant difference between the two  groups (χ(2) = 594.0, P < 0.01). After cultured for 96 h, the expression of ZO-1  protein in cells exposed to pressure was higher than those in control.  CONCLUSIONS: The biological activity of endothelial cells is regulated positively  by bionic pressure. The establishment of a new biomimetic pressure model will  help to investigate the physiological function and injury repair of corneal  endothelial cells in vitro.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence and to describe wound complications and associated risk factors of pediatric tracheotomy. DESIGN: Retrospective case  series. SETTING: Freestanding tertiary care academic pediatric hospital.  PATIENTS: Sixty-five consecutive children undergoing tracheotomy over 15 months.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Postoperative wound complications objectively and  independently documented by an advanced practice nurse specializing in  tracheotomy care. Secondary outcome measures included comorbidities, mortality  rates, and wound status after subsequent examinations and management. RESULTS:  The mean (SEM) patient age at tracheotomy was 45 (8.7) months (median age, 9.1  months). The most common indication for tracheotomy was pulmonary disease  (36.9%), followed by neurologic impairment and laryngeal abnormalities. There  were 19 patients (29%) with and 46 patients (71%) without wound complications.  There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in age (P = .68) or  weight (P = .55); however, infants younger than 12 months had an increased  complication rate (39% vs. 17%, P = .04). The type of tracheotomy tube was  predictive of postoperative wound complications (P = .02). All patients with  wounds received aggressive local wound care. Five of 13 patients had complete  resolution of stomal wounds, whereas 8 patients had persistent wound issues.  There were 5 non-wound-related mortalities. CONCLUSIONS: With attempts to  classify tracheotomy wound breakdowns as reportable events, including never  events, increasing emphasis is being placed on posttracheotomy care. This study  demonstrates that wound breakdown in pediatric tracheotomy patients is common.  These complications can be mitigated, although not prevented completely, with  aggressive wound surveillance and specialized wound care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute compartment syndrome (CS) is a limb-threatening disease that results from increased intracompartmental pressure. The pathophysiologic  mechanisms by which this occurs are poorly understood. This study was designed to  measure the effects of increased intracompartmental pressure on skeletal muscle  microcirculation, inflammation and cellular injury using intravital  videomicroscopy (IVVM) in a clinically relevant small animal model. METHODS: We  induced CS in 10 male Wistar rats (175-250 g), using a saline infusion technique.  Intracompartmental pressure was controlled between 30 and 40 mm Hg and maintained  for 45 minutes. After fasciotomy, the extensor digitorum longus muscle was  visualized using IVVM, and perfusion was quantified. We quantified leukocyte  recruitment to measure the inflammatory response. We measured muscle cellular  injury using a differential fluorescent staining technique. RESULTS: The number  of nonperfused capillaries increased from 12.7 (standard error of the mean [SEM]  1.4 ) per mm in the control group to 30.0 (SEM 6.7) per mm following 45 minutes  of elevated intracompartmental pressure (CS group; p = 0.031). The mean number of  continuously perfused capillaries (and SEM) decreased from 78.4 (3.2) per mm in  the control group to 41.4 (6.9) per mm in the CS group (p = 0.001). The  proportion of injured cells increased from 5.0% (SEM 2.1%) in the control group  to 16.3% (SEM 6.8%) in the CS group (p = 0.006). The mean number of activated  leukocytes increased from 3.6 (SEM 0.7) per 100 μm(2) in the control group to 8.6  (SEM 1.8) per 100 μm(2) in the CS group (p = 0.033). CONCLUSION: Early CS-induced  microvascular dysfunction resulted in a decrease in nutritive capillary perfusion  and an increase in cellular injury and was associated with a severe acute  inflammatory component.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The recent development of a large panel of genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) provides the opportunity to examine genetic  relationships between distinct SHR lines that share hypertension but differ in  their susceptibility to hypertensive end-organ disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: We  compared genotypes at nearly 10,000 SNPs obtained for the hypertension end-organ  injury-susceptible spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR)-A3 (SHRSP, SHR-stroke  prone) line and the injury-resistant SHR-B2 line. This revealed that that the 2  lines were genetically identical by descent (IBD) across 86.6% of the genome.  Areas of the genome that were not IBD were distributed across 19 of the 20  autosomes and the X chromosome. A block structure of non-IBD comprising a total  of 121 haplotype blocks was formed by clustering of SNPs inherited from different  ancestors. To test the null hypothesis that distinct SHR lines share a common set  of hypertension susceptibility alleles, we compared blood pressure in adult SHR  animals from both lines and their F1 and F2 progeny using telemetry. In 16- to  18-week-old animals fed a normal diet, systolic blood pressure (SBP, mm Hg) in  SHR-A3 was 205.7 ± 3.86 (mean ± SEM, n = 26), whereas in similar SHR-B2 animals,  SBP was 186.7 ± 2.53 (n = 20). In F1 and F2 animals, SBP was 188.2 ± 4.23 (n =  19) and 185.6 ± 1.1 (n = 211), respectively (P<10(-6), ANOVA). To identify  non-IBD haplotype blocks contributing to blood pressure differences between these  SHR lines, we developed a high-throughput SNP genotyping system to genotype SNPs  marking non-IBD blocks. We mapped a single non-IBD block on chromosome 17  extending over <10 Mb, at which SHR-A3 alleles significantly elevate blood  pressure compared with SHR-B2. CONCLUSIONS: Thus hypertension in SHR-A3 and -B2  appears to arise from an overlapping set of susceptibility alleles, with SHR-A3  possessing an additional hypertension locus that contributes to further increase  blood pressure.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study was conducted to investigate the role of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in mediating acute kidney injury in endotoxemic sheep using the  selective TLR4 inhibitor TAK-242. METHODS: A randomized, controlled, experimental  study was performed with 20 adult Texel crossbred sheep. Before an Escherichia  coli lipopolysaccharide infusion (3 μg · kg(-1) · h(-1) for 24 h), sheep were  randomized to receive a bolus dose (2 mg/kg), followed by a continuous infusion  (4 mg · kg(-1) · 24 h(-1)) of either TAK-242 (n = 7) or vehicle (n = 7). A third  group of lipopolysaccharide-treated sheep (n = 6) received norepinephrine,  titrated to maintain baseline arterial blood pressure. RESULTS: Endotoxin  infusion established a state of hyperdynamic circulation, with an increased  cardiac index, hypotension, and tachycardia. Urine output and creatinine  clearance decreased throughout the experiment, together with increasing plasma  creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and arterial lactate concentrations. After 24 h,  TLR4 inhibition had significantly (P ≤ 0.001) attenuated the mean ± SEM decrease  in arterial pressure (97 ± 3 vs. 71 ± 4 mmHg), urine output (1.16 ± 0.15 vs. 0.13  ± 0.05 ml · kg(-1) · h(-1)), and creatinine clearance (126 ± 13 vs. 20 ± 7  ml/min) compared with vehicle-treated animals. Furthermore, arterial lactate,  plasma creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen concentrations were significantly  lower in the TAK-242 group versus the vehicle-treated animals. Compared with TLR4  inhibition, norepinephrine caused similar effects on arterial pressure, cardiac  index, and heart rate; however, it did not attenuate the decrease in urine output  or creatinine clearance. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate a critical role for  TLR4 in impairing renal function during ovine endotoxemia that is independent of  changes in central hemodynamics.

AB  - BACKGROUND: No established therapy is available for patients with thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO) and critical limb ischemia. Since abnormalities of the immune  system appear to be involved in the pathogenesis, we investigated in this pilot  study the efficiency of Ig immunoadsorption (IA) therapy. METHODS: Ten patients  with advanced TAO underwent a single IA course over five consecutive days. Before  IA angiography was performed. In addition, the following were conducted prior to  IA, directly after, as well as 1, 3, and 6 months after IA: clinical examination,  pain scale (0-10), treadmill test for evaluation of maximum walking distances,  and several angiological methods for evaluation of disease extent:  photoplethysmography, ultrasound Doppler, and transcutaneous assessment of  partial carbon dioxide (tcPCO(2)) and oxygen (tcPCO(2)) pressure. RESULTS:  Immunoadsorption treatment was tolerated without side effects. Pain intensity  decreased rapidly from 7.7 ± 0.8 (mean ± SEM) before treatment to 2.0 ± 1.2 at  the second day of IA. One month after IA, all patients were without pain. This  functional amelioration persisted over the follow-up period of 6 months.  Correspondingly, maximum walking distances significantly increased from 301.7 ±  191.4 to 727.0 ± 192.7 m immediately after IA, and further continuously up to  1,811.0 ± 223.7 at 6 months after IA. Healing of ischemic ulcerations was  observed in all patients during follow-up. (tcPCO(2)) and (tcPCO(2)) values as  well as photopletysmographic data that were severely compromised before IA  reflecting reduced tissue oxygenation and perfusion showed rapid amelioration  reaching normal values at 1 month. CONCLUSION: Anti-Ig IA appears to be an  effective therapeutic option for patients with advanced TAO.

T2  - Food microbiology
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of supercritical carbon dioxide (SCCO(2)) for inactivating Lactobacillus plantarum in apple cider using a  continuous system with a gas-liquid metal contactor. Pasteurized apple cider  without preservatives was inoculated with L. plantarum and processed using a  SCCO(2) system at a CO(2) concentration range of 0-12% (g CO(2)/100g product),  outlet temperatures of 34, 38, and 42 °C, a system pressure of 7.6 MPa, and a  flow rate of 1 L/min. Processing with SCCO(2) significantly (P<0.05) enhanced  inactivation of L. plantarum in apple cider, resulting in a 5 log reduction with  8% CO(2) at 42 °C. The response surface model indicated that both CO(2)  concentration and temperature contributed to the microbial inactivation. The  extent of sublethal injury in surviving cells in processed apple cider increased  as CO(2) concentration and processing temperature increased, however the percent  injury dramatically decreased during SCCO(2) processing at 42 °C. Structural  damage in cell membranes after SCCO(2) processing was observed by SEM.  Refrigeration (4 °C) after SCCO(2) processing effectively inhibited the re-growth  of surviving L. plantarum during storage for 28 days. Thus this study suggests  that SCCO(2) processing is effective in eliminating L. plantarum and could be  applicable for nonthermal pasteurization of apple cider.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of plasma-based resuscitation for trauma patients in hemorrhagic shock has been associated with a decrease in mortality. Although some  have proposed a beneficial effect through replacement of coagulation proteins,  the putative mechanisms of protection afforded by plasma are unknown. We have  previously shown in a cell culture model that plasma decreases endothelial cell  permeability in comparison with crystalloid. The endothelial glycocalyx consists  of proteoglycans and glycoproteins attached to a syndecan backbone, which  together protect the underlying endothelium. We hypothesize that endothelial cell  protection by plasma is due, in part, to its restoration of the endothelial  glycocalyx and preservation of syndecan-1 after hemorrhagic shock. METHODS: Rats  were subjected to hemorrhagic shock to a mean arterial blood pressure of 30 mm Hg  for 90 minutes followed by resuscitation with either lactated Ringer's (LR)  solution or fresh plasma to a mean arterial blood pressure of 80 mm Hg and  compared with shams or shock alone. After 2 hours, lungs were harvested for  syndecan mRNA, immunostained with antisyndecan-1, or stained with hematoxylin and  eosin. To specifically examine the effect of plasma on the endothelium, we  infused small bowel mesentery with a lanthanum-based solution, identified  venules, and visualized the glycocalyx by electron microscopy. All data are  presented as mean ± SEM. Results were analyzed by 1-way analysis of variance with  Tukey post hoc tests. RESULTS: Electron microscopy revealed degradation of the  glycocalyx after hemorrhagic shock, which was partially restored by plasma but  not LR. Pulmonary syndecan-1 mRNA expression was higher in animals resuscitated  with plasma (2.76 ± 0.03) in comparison with shock alone (1.39 ± 0.22) or LR  (0.82 ± 0.03) and correlated with cell surface syndecan-1 immunostaining. Shock  also resulted in significant lung injury by histopathology scoring (1.63 ± 0.26),  which was mitigated by resuscitation with plasma (0.67 ± 0.17) but not LR (2.0 ±  0.25). CONCLUSION: The protective effects of plasma may be due in part to its  ability to restore the endothelial glycocalyx and preserve syndecan-1 after  hemorrhagic shock.

AB  - Plant polyphenols, i.e. green tea extract (GTE), possess high antioxidative and anti-inflammatory capacity, thus being protective in various models of acute  inflammation. However, their anti-inflammatory effect and a feasible mechanism in  haemorrhage/resuscitation (H/R)-induced liver injury remain unknown. We  investigated the effects of GTE and the role of NF-κB in the pathogenesis of  liver injury induced by H/R, and their effects on intercellular adhesion  molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression and neutrophil infiltration. Female Lewis rats  were fed a standard chow diet (control, ctrl) or a diet containing 0·1 %  polyphenolic GTE for five consecutive days before H/R. Rats were haemorrhaged to  a mean arterial pressure of 30 (sem 2) mmHg for 60 min and resuscitated. Control  groups (sham_ctrl and sham_GTE) underwent surgical procedures without H/R. At 2 h  after resuscitation, tissues were harvested. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT)  and IL-6 were measured. Hepatic necrosis, ICAM-1 expression and polymorphonuclear  leucocyte (PMNL) infiltration were assessed. Hepatic expression of IκBα (phospho)  was measured. H/R induced strong liver damage with increased necrosis and serum  ALT levels. Compared with both sham groups, inflammatory markers (serum IL-6 and  hepatic PMNL infiltration) were elevated after H/R (P < 0·05). Also, H/R  increased IκBα phosphorylation. GTE administration markedly (P < 0·05) decreased  serum ALT and IL-6 levels, hepatic necrosis as well as PMNL infiltration and the  expression of ICAM-1 and phosphorylated IκBα compared with H/R. In conclusion, we  observed that NF-κB activation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of  liver injury after H/R through the up-regulation of hepatic ICAM-1 expression and  subsequent PMNL infiltration. GTE pre-treatment prevents liver damage in this  model of acute inflammation through a NF-κB-dependent mechanism.

TI  - Opioid facilitation of rewarding electrical brain stimulation is suppressed in rats with neuropathic pain.
AU  - Ewan, Eric E.
AU  - Martin, Thomas J.
T2  - Anesthesiology
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Opioids are powerful analgesics, but are also common drugs of abuse. Few studies have examined how neuropathic pain alters the pharmacology of  opioids in modulating limbic pathways that underlie abuse liability. METHODS:  Rats with or without spinal nerve ligation (SNL) were implanted with electrodes  into the left ventral tegmental area and trained to lever press for electrical  stimulation. The effects of morphine, heroin, and cocaine on facilitating  electrical stimulation of the ventral tegmental area and mechanical allodynia  were assessed in SNL and control subjects. RESULTS: Responding for electrical  stimulation of the ventral tegmental area was similar in control and SNL rats.  The frequency at which rats emitted 50% of maximal responding was 98.2 ± 5.1  (mean ± SEM) and 93.7 ± 2.8 Hz in control and SNL rats, respectively. Morphine  reduced the frequency at which rats emitted 50% of maximal responding in control  (maximal shift of 14.8 ± 3.1 Hz), but not SNL (2.3 ± 2.2 Hz) rats. Heroin was  less potent in SNL rats, whereas cocaine produced similar shifts in control (42.3  ± 2.0 Hz) and SNL (37.5 ± 4.2 Hz) rats. CONCLUSIONS: Nerve injury suppressed  potentiation of electrical stimulation of the ventral tegmental area by opioids,  suggesting that the positive reinforcing effects are diminished by chronic pain.  Given concerns regarding prescription opioid abuse, developing strategies that  assess both analgesia and abuse liability within the context of chronic pain may  aid in determining which opioids are most suitable for treating chronic pain when  abuse is a concern.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bedside percutaneous tracheostomy (BPT) is a cost-effective alternative to open tracheostomy. Small series have consistently documented  minimal morbidity, but BPT has yet to be embraced as the standard of care.  Because this has been our preferred technique in the surgical ICU for more than  20 years, we reviewed our experience to ascertain its safety. We hypothesize that  BPT has acceptably minimal morbidity, even in high-risk patients. STUDY DESIGN:  Patients undergoing BPT from January 1998 to June 2008 were reviewed. High-risk  patients were defined as those with cervical collar or halo, cervical spine  injuries, systemic heparinization, positive end-expiratory pressure >10 cm H(2)O  or fraction of inspired oxygen > 50%. RESULTS: During the study period, 1,000  patients underwent BPT (74% men; mean ± SEM age 46 ± 0.6 years; 70% trauma). BPT  was performed 8.9 ± 0.2 days (mean ± SEM) after admission. Patients remained  ventilator dependent for an additional 9.7 ± 0.4 days (mean ± SEM). There were  482 (48%) patients undergoing BPT who were considered high-risk: 1 risk category,  273 patients; 2 risk categories, 139 patients; 3 risk categories, 56 patients; 4  risk categories, 12 patients; 5 risk categories, 2 patients. Complications  occurred in 14 (1.4%) patients. Early complications included tracheostomy tube  misplacement requiring revision (n = 4), bleeding requiring intervention (n = 2),  infection (n = 1), and procedure failure requiring cricothyroidotomy (n = 1).  Late complications included persistent stoma requiring operative closure (n = 4)  and subglottic stenosis (n = 2). There were 6 complications (1.2%) in normal risk  and 8 complications (1.7%) in high-risk patients. There were no deaths related to  BPT. CONCLUSIONS: BPT in the surgical intensive care unit is a safe procedure,  even in high-risk patients. We believe BPT is the new gold standard for patients  requiring tracheostomy for mechanical ventilation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the feasibility, efficacy and safety of performing ab externo sclerostomy with a femtosecond laser in rabbits with chronic ocular  hypertension. METHOD: The chronic ocular hypertension model was induced by  injecting α-chymotrypsin into posterior chamber. Twenty rabbits with chronic  ocular hypertension were randomly divided into experiment and control groups,  each group consisting of 10 rabbits. An ab externo sclerostomy using a  femtosecond laser was performed in the right eyes in the experiment group. The  right eyes in control group were unoperated. The laser was a pulsed  titanium-sapphire laser, operating at a repetition rate of 1000 per second, 0.4  mJ pulse energy, a central wavelength of 800 nm and a pulse duration of 50  femtoseconds. The survival of filtration blebs, clinical manifestation and  intraocular pressure (IOP) were observed for 1 month after surgery. Animals were  killed on days 3, 7, 14 and 30 post-operatively. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE)  staining and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were performed to evaluate the  histopathologic changes in filtering tracts. The differences in IOP between the  experiment and control groups were analyzed by repeated measures analysis of  variance. RESULTS: A 2 mm × 1 mm clear full-thickness scleral incision was  created in each eye in the experiment group which was hit only once by the laser.  The laser treated time was approximately 15 - 16 s. There was a significant  difference (F = 117.46, 39.96, 15.17, 11.62, 15.31, 11.10; P < 0.01). IOP between  experiment and control groups at post-operatively day 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 30. No  serious intra- or post-operative complications happened in the treated eyes  except for anterior chamber hemorrhage in 2 eyes triggered by laser injury to  iris root. A conjunctival bleb was successfully formed in all treated eyes at 1  day after surgery and lasted from 14 to 21 days. Histopathology showed that the  perforating scleral incisions created by femtosecond laser were sharply defined,  with almost no collateral damage to the surrounding tissue. The tissue repair  response in the filtering tracts was characterized by mild hyperplasia of  fibroblasts and the loose deposition of a small amount of new collagen fibers.  CONCLUSION: The current study demonstrates that ab externo femtosecond laser  sclerostomy is a feasible, safe and effective option for the treatment of  glaucoma.

AB  - Inhalation of perfluorohexane vapor (PFH) and high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) both have been shown to improve lung function in acute lung  injury (ALI). Their combination implies synergistic action. The authors  investigated technical aspects of PFH vaporization during HFOV and effects on gas  exchange in a pilot study of experimental ALI. Eighteen anesthetized sheep were  randomly assigned to HFOV or HFOV with PFH inhalation after oleic acid-induced  ALI. HFOV was set to a continuous distending pressure of 25 cm H₂O, and an  oscillation of 80 to 100 cm H₂O at a frequency of 5 Hz. PFH vapor was delivered  by means of bypassed high-flow oxygen through a thin endotracheal tube. PFH  concentration was measured by infrared absorption. Blood gases and hemodynamic  data were taken. PaO₂ significantly increased from 9.1 ± 0.9 to 32.7 ± 9.5 kPa  (mean ± SEM) in the HFOV group and from 12.5 ± 1.1 to 27.0 ± 6.8 kPa in the HFOV  PFH group. PaCO₂ significantly decreased from 6.3 ± 0.3 to 5.5 ± 0.5 kPa in the  HFOV group and from 5.7 ± 0.4 to 4.9 ± 0.5 kPa in the HFOV PFH group. Changes in  gas exchange were not different between groups. These results show that the  inhalation of PFH during HFOV is technically feasible, but did not enhance gas  exchange in a 210-minute observation period of experimental ALI.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the correlation of intracranial pressure (ICP) measurement and time to detection of ICP crises (defined as ICP ≥ 20 mm Hg for ≥ 5 mins)  between an intraparenchymal (IP) monitor and external ventricular drain (EVD) in  children for whom continuous cerebrospinal fluid diversion was used as a therapy  for severe traumatic brain injury. SETTING: Academic, pediatric intensive care  unit. DESIGN: Retrospective review of a prospectively collected pediatric  neurotrauma database. PATIENTS: Children with severe traumatic brain injury  (Glasgow Coma Scale score of ≤ 8) who underwent ICP monitoring with both IP and  EVD techniques were studied. In cohort 1 (n = 58), hourly ICP measurements were  extracted from the medical record; in cohort 2 (n = 4), ICP measurements were  collected every minute by an automated data-collection system. MEASUREMENTS AND  MAIN RESULTS: The mean absolute difference in ICP (|N5ICP|N5) and intraclass  correlation coefficients were calculated. Timing to detection of ICP crises was  analyzed. Data were expressed as mean ± sem. For cohort 1, 7,387 hrs of data were  analyzed; 399 hrs (23,940 mins) were analyzed for cohort 2. In cohort 1, the  |N5ICP|N5 was 3.10 ± 0.04 mm Hg (intraclass correlation coefficients = 0.98, p <  .001). The |N5ICP|N5 in cohort 2 was 3.30 ± 0.05 mm Hg (intraclass correlation  coefficients = 0.98, p < .001). In cohort 2, a total of 75 ICP crises were  observed. Fifty-five (73%) were detected first by the IP monitor, of which 35  were not identified by the EVD monitor. Time between IP and EVD detection of a  crisis was 12.60 ± 2.34 mins. CONCLUSION: EVD and IP measurements of ICP were  highly correlated, although intermittent EVD ICP measurements may fail to  identify ICP events when continuously draining cerebrospinal fluid. In  institutions that use continuous cerebrospinal fluid diversion as a therapy, a  two-monitor system may be valuable for accomplishing monitoring and therapeutic  goals.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether transtendon repair by use of a novel small-diameter knotless anchor showed enhanced mechanical  properties compared with tear completion and repair. METHODS: Articular-sided  partial-thickness tears were created ex vivo in the infraspinatus of 24 ovine  shoulders. The specimens were randomized into 4 groups of 6 each: (1) no repair,  (2) transtendon repair, (3) completion of tear with tension-band single-row  repair, and (4) completion of tear with double-row repair. Footprint contact  pressure and ultimate load to failure were measured in each specimen. RESULTS:  Technical failure of the transtendon anchors occurred in 3 of 15 shoulders.  Transtendon repair (mean +/- SEM, 0.8 +/- 0.1 MPa) and double-row repair (1 +/-  0.09 MPa) showed 3-fold (P < .001) greater footprint contact pressures than  tension-band single-row repair (0.3 +/- 0.03 MPa) and no repair (0.3 +/- 0.02  MPa). The ultimate load to failure for transtendon repair (544 +/- 22 N) was more  than 3 times greater than that for the double-row repair (157 +/- 23 N) (P <  .001) and the single-row repair (116 +/- 11 N) (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS:  Transtendon repair of partial-thickness tears by use of specifically designed  anchors biomechanically outperformed tear completion and repair in an ovine  model. Transtendon repair showed the best combination of high footprint contact  pressure and high ultimate failure load. However, the high insertion failure rate  of these transtendon anchors is of concern. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: On the basis of  the biomechanical data, transtendon repair of partial-thickness rotator cuff  tears may be used as an alternative to tear completion and repair, but the  specific transtendon anchors used in this study need further evaluation before  their clinical use can be recommended.

T2  - Clinical physiology and functional imaging
AB  - AIM: To test if a small muscle injury influences the vascular reactivity to adrenaline in human skeletal muscle. METHODS: Blood flow was measured by ¹³³Xenon  clearance in the gastrocnemius muscle of eight male subjects at basal and during  i.v. infusion of adrenaline (0.1 nmol kg⁻¹ min⁻¹) or placebo. Measurements were  done with (expts 2 and 3) or without (expt 1) the influence of a small muscle  injury induced by inserting a microdialysis catheter. ¹³³Xenon was administered  either (expt 1) conventionally into the muscle via a fine needle, or (expts 2 and  3) through a fine tube close to the inserted microdialysis catheter. Expt 3  (control expt) was identical to expt 2 except that placebo was infused instead of  adrenaline. Mean ± SEM, n= 8. RESULTS:   The blood flow tended to increase during  the adrenaline infusion in expt 1 (1.17 ± 0.10 to 1.39 ± 0.15, N.S.), whereas it  decreased during the adrenaline infusion in expt 2, from 1.39 ± 0.14 to 1.03 ±  0.14 ml min⁻¹ 100 g tissue⁻¹ (P<0.001). The blood flow change in response to  adrenaline infusion was significantly different in expt 1 and expt 2 (P<0.05).  Blood flow also decreased during the placebo infusion in expt 3 (1.15 ± 0.10 to  1.00 ± 0.09, P<0.01), but this decrease was significantly smaller than in  response to the adrenaline infusion in expt 2, P<0.01. CONCLUSION: The present  results are consistent with the hypothesis that the small muscle injury caused by  the inserted microdialysis catheter influences the vascular reactivity to  adrenaline in a vasoconstrictive direction.

AB  - Premature infants are subjected to adverse effects of intubation to benefit from surfactant. We hypothesized that administration of surfactant through a laryngeal  mask airway (LMA) is as effective as administration through an endotracheal tube  (ETT) and that time and physiologic changes during instrumentation will be less  in the LMA group. This study is a randomized, controlled trial using newborn  pigs. Lung injury was induced via surfactant washout. Animals were randomized  into groups: 1) LMA placed, no surfactant administered (control; n = 8); 2)  surfactant via an LMA (LMA group; n = 8); and 3) surfactant via an ETT (ETT  group; n = 8). We demonstrated that partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood  (Pao2) levels of the LMA and ETT groups were not statistically different. Time  for successful placement of LMA was 19 ± 1 s versus ETT 123 ± 35 s (mean ± SEM);  number of attempts for successful LMA placement was 1.1 (1-2) versus ETT 1.9  (1-7) [mean (range)]. Administration of surfactant via an LMA compared with an  ETT resulted in similar improvements in oxygenation. Placement of the device  required less time and fewer attempts. These data suggest that further study in  human neonates is justified. If proven effective, some infants with respiratory  distress may be able to receive surfactant while avoiding intubation.

AB  - Fifty percent of diabetics (7% of general population) suffer from peripheral arterial occlusive disease, which may lead to amputation due to critical limb  ischemia (CLI). The aim of our study was to prevent major limb amputation (MLA)  in this group of patients using a local application of autologous bone marrow  stem cells (ABMSC) concentrate. A total of 96 patients with CLI and foot ulcer  (FU) were randomized into groups I and II. Patients in group I (n = 42, 36 males,  6 females, 66.2 ± 10.6 years) underwent local treatment with ABMSC while those in  group II (n = 54, control, 42 males, 12 females, 64.1 ± 8.6 years) received  standard medical care. The frequency of major limb amputation in groups I and II  was 21% and 44% within the 120 days of follow up, respectively (p < 0.05). Only  in salvaged limbs of group I both toe pressure and toe brachial index increased  (from 22.66 ± 5.32 to 25.63 ± 4.75 mmHg and from 0.14 ± 0.03 to 0.17 ± 0.03,  respectively, mean ± SEM). The CD34(+) cell counts in bone marrow concentrate  (BMC) decreased (correlation, p = 0.024) with age, even though there was no  correlation between age and healing. An unexpected finding was made of relative,  bone marrow lymphopenia in the initial bone marrow concentrates in patients who  failed ABMSC therapy (21% of MLA). This difference was statistically significant  (p < 0.040). We conclude ABMSC therapy results in 79% limb salvage in patients  suffering from CLI and FU. In the remaining 21% lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia  were identified as potential causative factors, suggesting that at least a  partial correction with platelet supplementation may be beneficial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Animal experiments have suggested that the laparoscopic peritoneal environment is hypoxic. This study aimed to investigate whether peritoneal tissue  is hypoxic on a cellular level during a carbon dioxide (CO(2)) pneumoperitoneum  at different intraperitoneal pressures (IPPs) and to determine the short-term  effects of surgical injury on the hypoxia status of peritoneal tissue in the  injured peritoneum and the distant noninjured peritoneum at cellular and  molecular levels. METHODS: Experiment 1: Mice were divided into five groups  according to the following treatments: anesthesia alone, laparotomy, and CO(2)  pneumoperitoneum at IPPs of 2, 8, or 15 mmHg. Over the course of each experiment,  the peritoneal tissue-oxygen tension (PitO(2)) was continuously monitored.  Experiment 2: On the first day, the mice were divided into three groups according  to the following treatments: CO(2) pneumoperitoneum at an IPP of either 2 or 8  mmHg or laparotomy. The bilateral caudal epigastric arteries and uterine horns  then were coagulated using a bipolar cautery device. On day 7, peritoneal tissue  samples were collected for real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain  reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry. In both experiments, pimonidazole  hydrochloride was used to detect tissue hypoxia at a cellular level. RESULTS:  Experiment 1: Peritoneal hypoxia at both tissue and cellular levels was detected  only in the groups treated with an IPP of 15 mmHg (PitO(2): 5.2 ± 1.0 mmHg, mean  ± SEM). Experiment 2: The percentage of pimonidazole immunostained mesothelial  and stromal cells from the distant noninjured peritoneum was significantly higher  in the group treated with an IPP of 8 mmHg than in the other groups.  Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha subunit mRNA expression in the distant  noninjured peritoneum of the group treated with an IPP of 8 mmHg was  significantly higher than in the control group (anesthesia alone). CONCLUSION:  The CO(2) pneumoperitoneum itself did not cause peritoneal hypoxia at either a  tissue or a cellular level in a mouse model when a low IPP was used.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) can cause brain ischemia and compromised brain oxygen (PbtO2 < or = 20 mm Hg) after severe traumatic brain  injury (TBI). OBJECTIVE: We examined whether decompressive craniectomy (DC) to  treat elevated ICP reduces the cumulative ischemic burden (CIB) of the brain and  therapeutic intensity level (TIL). METHODS: Ten severe TBI patients (mean age,  31.4 +/- 14.2 years) who had continuous PbtO2 monitoring before and after delayed  DC were retrospectively identified. Patients were managed according to the  guidelines for the management of severe TBI. The CIB was measured as the total  time spent between a PbtO2 of 15 to 20, 10 to 15, and 0 to 10 mm Hg. The TIL was  calculated every 12 hours. Mixed-effects models were used to estimate changes  associated with DC. RESULTS: DC was performed on average 2.8 days after  admission. DC was found to immediately reduce ICP (mean [SEM] decrease was 7.86  mm Hg [2.4 mm Hg]; P = .005). TIL, which was positively correlated with ICP (r =  0.46, P < or = .001), was reduced within 12 hours after surgery and continued to  improve within the postsurgical monitoring period (P </= .001). The duration and  severity of CIB were significantly reduced as an effect of DC in this group. The  overall mortality rate in the group of 10 patients was lower than predicted at  the time of admission (P = .015). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that a DC for  increased ICP can reduce the CIB of the brain after severe TBI. We suggest that  DC be considered early in a patient's clinical course, particularly when the TIL  and ICP are increased.

AB  - PURPOSE: In acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), combined high-frequency oscillation (HFO) and tracheal gas insufflation (TGI) may improve oxygenation  through a TGI-induced increase in mean tracheal pressure (P(tr)). We compared  standard HFO and HFO-TGI matched for P(tr), in order to determine whether TGI  affects gas exchange independently from P (tr). METHODS: We conducted a  prospective, randomized, crossover, physiological study in a 37-bed intensive  care unit. Twenty-two patients with early acute lung injury (ALI) or ARDS were  enrolled. On day 1, patients were ventilated with HFO, without (60 min) and  combined with TGI (60 min) in random order. HFO/HFO-TGI sessions were repeated in  inverse order within 7 h. HFO/HFO-TGI mean airway pressure (P(aw)) was titrated  to a P(tr) that was either equal to (low P(aw)) or 3 cmH(2)O higher than (high  P(aw)) the P(tr) of the preceding conventional mechanical ventilation. On day 2,  the protocol was repeated at the alternative P(tr) level relative to day 1.  RESULTS: Gas exchange and hemodynamics were determined before, during, and after  HFO/HFO-TGI sessions. HFO-TGI-high P(aw) versus HFO-high P(aw) resulted in  significantly higher PaO(2)/inspired O(2) fraction (FiO(2)) [mean +/- standard  error of the mean (SEM): 281.6 +/- 15.1 versus 199.0 +/- 15.0 mmHg; mean  increase: 42%; P < 0.001]. HFO-TGI-low P(aw), versus HFO-low P(aw), resulted in  significantly higher PaO(2)/FiO(2) (222.8 +/- 14.6 versus 141.3 +/- 8.7 mmHg;  mean increase: 58%; P < 0.001). PaCO(2) was significantly lower during  HFO-TGI-high P(aw) versus HFO-high P(aw) (45.3 +/- 1.6 versus 53.7 +/- 1.9 mmHg;  mean decrease: 16%; P = 0.037). CONCLUSIONS: At the same P(tr) level, HFO-TGI  results in superior gas exchange compared with HFO.

AB  - Entrapment neuropathy is a frequent clinical problem that can be caused by, among other factors, mechanical compression; however, exactly how a compressive force  affects the peripheral nerves remains poorly understood. In this study, using a  rabbit model of sciatic nerve injury (n=12), we evaluated the time-course of  changes in intraneural blood flow, compound nerve action potentials, and  functioning of the blood-nerve barrier during graded mechanical compression.  Nerve injury was applied using a compressor equipped with a custom-made pressure  transducer. Cessation of intraneural blood flow was noted at a mean compressive  force of 0.457+/-0.022 N (+/-SEM), and the compound action potential became zero  at 0.486+/-0.031 N. Marked extravasation of Evans blue albumin was noted after 20  min of intraneural ischemia. The functional changes induced by compression are  likely due to intraneural edema, which could subsequently result in impairment of  nerve function. These changes may be critical factors in the development of  symptoms associated with nerve compression.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Severe ischemia induces renal injury less frequently in women than men. In this study, cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation were used to  assess whether estradiol is renoprotective via an estrogen receptor  (ER)-dependent mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male and female C57BL/6 and ER  gene-deleted mice underwent 10 min of cardiac arrest followed by cardiopulmonary  resuscitation. Serum chemistries and renal stereology were measured 24 h after  arrest. RESULTS: Estrogen did not affect mean arterial pressure, regional renal  cortical blood flow, and arterial blood gases. Hence, female kidneys were  protected (mean +/- SEM: blood urea nitrogen, 65+/- 21 vs.149+/- 27 mg/dl, P =  0.04; creatinine, 0.14 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.73 +/- 0.16 mg/dl, P = 0.01; volume of  necrotic tubules, 7 +/- 1% vs. 10 +/- 0%, P = 0.04). Estrogen also reduced renal  injury. In intact females (n = 5), ovariectomized/vehicle-treated (n = 8), and  ovariectomized/estrogen-treated (n = 8) animals, blood urea nitrogen was 65 +/-  21, 166 +/- 28, and 50 +/- 14 mg/dl (P = 0.002); creatinine was 0.14 +/- 0.05,  0.74 +/- 0.26, and 0.23 +/- 0.27 mg/dl (P = 0.014); necrotic tubules were 2.5 +/-  0.25%, 12.0 +/- 1.9%, and 5.0 +/- 1.6% (P = 0.004), respectively. In ER-[alpha]  and ER-[beta] gene-deleted mice and controls estradiol-reduced functional injury  (blood urea nitrogen: estradiol 117 +/- 71, vehicle 167 +/- 56, P = 0.007;  creatinine: estradiol 0.5 +/- 0.5, vehicle 1.0 +/- 0.4, P = 0.013), but the  effect of estradiol was not different between ER-[alpha] or ER-[beta]  gene-deleted mice. Adding ICI 182,780 to estradiol did not alter injury.  CONCLUSIONS: In women, kidneys were protected from cardiac arrest through  estrogen. Estradiol-mediated renoprotection was not affected by ER deletion or  blockade. Estradiol is renoprotective after cardiac arrest. The results indicate  that estradiol renoprotection is ER-[alpha] and ER-[beta] independent.

AB  - This study evaluated the efficacy of a supercritical carbon dioxide (SCCO(2)) system with a gas-liquid porous metal contactor for eliminating Escherichia coli  K12 in apple cider. Pasteurized, preservative-free apple cider was inoculated  with E. coli K12 and processed using the SCCO(2) system at CO(2) concentrations  of 0-10% (wt.%, g CO(2)/100g product), outlet temperatures of 34, 38, and 42  degrees C, a system pressure of 7.6 MPa, and a flow rate of 1L/min. Increased  CO(2) concentrations and temperatures significantly (P<0.05) enhanced the  bactericidal effect, resulting in a maximum reduction of 7.31 log CFU/mL at 8%  CO(2) and 42 degrees C. A response surface model indicated that minimum CO(2)  concentrations of 9.9% at 34 degrees C, 7.4% at 38 degrees C, and 5.4% at 42  degrees C are needed to achieve a 5-log reduction of E. coli K12 in apple cider.  SEM observations showed morphological changes in the cell envelope after SCCO(2)  processing. At a processing condition of 8% and 38 degrees C, the reduction of E.  coli was 6.03 log and the sublethal injury of the survivors was 84%. The regrowth  or survival of E. coli in SCCO(2) processed apple cider was not observed during  storage for 28 days at 4, 8, and 20 degrees C. Thus this study showed the  potential of SCCO(2) processing with a gas-liquid porous metal contactor for the  nonthermal pasteurization of apple cider.

AU  - Kottner, Jan

T2  - International journal of nursing studies
AB  - BACKGROUND: The application of standardized pressure ulcer risk assessment scales is recommended in clinical practice. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to  compare the interrater reliabilities of the Braden and Waterlow scores and  subjective pressure ulcer risk assessment and to determine the construct validity  of these three assessment approaches. DESIGN: Observational. SETTINGS: Two  intensive care units of a large University Hospital in Germany. PARTICIPANTS: 21  and 24 patients were assessed by 53 nurses. Patients' mean age was 69.7 (SD 8.3)  and 67.2 (SD 11.3). METHODS: Two interrater reliability studies were conducted.  Samples of patients were assessed independently by a sample of three nurses. A  10-cm visual analogue scale was applied to measure subjective pressure ulcer risk  rating. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and standard errors of  measurement (SEM) were used to determine interrater reliability and agreement of  the item and sum scores. Pearson product moment correlation coefficients (r) were  used to indicate the degree and direction of the relationships between the  measures. RESULTS: The interrater reliability for the subjective pressure ulcer  risk assessment was ICC(1,1)=0.51 (95% CI 0.26-0.74) and 0.71 (95% CI 0.53-0.85).  Interrater reliability of Braden scale sum scores was ICC(1,1)=0.72 (95% CI  0.52-0.87) and 0.84 (95% CI 0.72-0.92) and for Waterlow scale sum scores  ICC(1,1)=0.36 (95% CI 0.09-0.63) and 0.51 (95% CI 0.27-0.72). The absolute degree  of correlation between the measures ranged from 0.51 to 0.77. CONCLUSIONS:  Interrater reliability coefficients indicate a high degree of measurement error  inherent in the scores. Compared to subjective risk assessment and the Waterlow  scale scores the Braden scale performed best. However, measurement error is too  high to draw valid inferences for individuals. Less than 26-59% of variances in  scores of one scale were determined by scores of another scale indicating that  all three instruments only partly measured the same construct. The use of the  Braden-, Waterlow- and Visual Analogue scales for measuring pressure ulcer risk  of intensive care unit patients is not recommended.

AB  - PURPOSE: Elevation of intracranial pressure (ICP) is a major complication of traumatic brain injury (TBI), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume is a key  factor in ICP regulation. Choroidal epithelial cells (CEC) form the blood-CSF  barrier and their integrity is essential for controlling CSF production. In the  current study, the morphology of the CEC was studied from 5 h to 28 day after TBI  in the rat. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to severe TBI using  the impact-acceleration model, and the ultrastructure of the CEC was studied  using transmission (TEM) and scanning (SEM) electron microscopy. RESULTS: Radical  ultrastructural changes were seen by TEM in CEC in injured animals. At 5 h  post-injury cell swelling and incipient cytoplasmic vacuoles were seen. At 24 h  most severe changes were noted with extensive widening of intercellular clefts.  At 7 day and 14 day post-injury, increased cytoplasmic electron density was  evident. At 21 day, most microvilli had bulbous ends, and at 28 day cytoplasmic  vacuoles were numerous with widened intercellular clefts. SEM revealed a  continuum of changes in all injured animals and most conspicuous was the  heterogeneity of surface features, with most cells showing bulbous and cup-shaped  microvilli, burr-like processes and pits. Epiplexus cells were hypertrophic and  more numerous. CONCLUSION: At 4 weeks after trauma, choroidal epithelial cells  continued to show morphological alterations suggesting that brain homeostasis was  still not restored.

AB  - OBJECT: Oxygen delivered in supraphysiological amounts is currently under investigation as a therapy for severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Hyperoxia can  be delivered to the brain under normobaric as well as hyperbaric conditions. In  this study the authors directly compare hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) and normobaric  hyperoxia (NBH) treatment effects. METHODS: Sixty-nine patients who had sustained  severe TBIs (mean Glasgow Coma Scale Score 5.8) were prospectively randomized to  1 of 3 groups within 24 hours of injury: 1) HBO2, 60 minutes of HBO(2) at 1.5  ATA; 2) NBH, 3 hours of 100% fraction of inspired oxygen at 1 ATA; and 3)  control, standard care. Treatments occurred once every 24 hours for 3 consecutive  days. Brain tissue PO(2), microdialysis, and intracranial pressure were  continuously monitored. Cerebral blood flow (CBF), arteriovenous differences in  oxygen, cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2), CSF lactate and F2-isoprostane  concentrations, and bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid interleukin (IL)-8 and  IL-6 assays were obtained pretreatment and 1 and 6 hours posttreatment.  Mixed-effects linear modeling was used to statistically test differences among  the treatment arms as well as changes from pretreatment to posttreatment.  RESULTS: In comparison with values in the control group, the brain tissue PO2  levels were significantly increased during treatment in both the HBO2 (mean +/-  SEM, 223 +/- 29 mm Hg) and NBH (86 +/- 12 mm Hg) groups (p < 0.0001) and  following HBO2 until the next treatment session (p = 0.003). Hyperbaric O2  significantly increased CBF and CMRO2 for 6 hours (p < or = 0.01). Cerebrospinal  fluid lactate concentrations decreased posttreatment in both the HBO2 and NBH  groups (p < 0.05). The dialysate lactate levels in patients who had received HBO2  decreased for 5 hours posttreatment (p = 0.017). Microdialysis lactate/pyruvate  (L/P) ratios were significantly decreased posttreatment in both HBO2 and NBH  groups (p < 0.05). Cerebral blood flow, CMRO2, microdialysate lactate, and the  L/P ratio had significantly greater improvement when a brain tissue PO2 > or =  200 mm Hg was achieved during treatment (p < 0.01). Intracranial pressure was  significantly lower after HBO2 until the next treatment session (p < 0.001) in  comparison with levels in the control group. The treatment effect persisted over  all 3 days. No increase was seen in the CSF F2-isoprostane levels, microdialysate  glycerol, and BAL inflammatory markers, which were used to monitor potential O2  toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Hyperbaric O2 has a more robust posttreatment effect than  NBH on oxidative cerebral metabolism related to its ability to produce a brain  tissue PO2 > or = 200 mm Hg. However, it appears that O2 treatment for severe TBI  is not an all or nothing phenomenon but represents a graduated effect. No signs  of pulmonary or cerebral O2 toxicity were present.

T2  - Journal of neurotrauma
AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with an almost immediate reduction in cerebral blood flow (CBF). Because cerebral perfusion pressure is often normal  under these circumstances it was hypothesized that the reduction of  post-traumatic CBF has to occur at the level of the microcirculation. The aim of  the current study was to investigate whether cerebral microvessels are involved  in the development of blood flow disturbances following experimental TBI. C57/BL6  mice (n = 12) were intubated and ventilated under control of end-tidal Pco(2)  ((ET)P(CO2)). After preparation of a cranial window and baseline recordings, the  animals were subjected to experimental TBI by controlled cortical impact (CCI; 6  m/sec, 0.5 mm). Vessel lumina and intravascular cells were visualized by in vivo  fluorescence microscopy (IVM) using the fluorescent dyes FITC-dextran and  rhodamine 6G, respectively. Vessel diameter, cell-endothelial interactions, and  thrombus formation were quantified within the traumatic penumbra by IVM up to 2 h  after CCI. Arteriolar diameters increased after CCI by 26.2 +/- 2.5% (mean +/-  SEM, p < 0.01 versus baseline), and remained at this level until the end of the  observation period. Rolling of leukocytes on the cerebrovascular endothelium was  observed both in arterioles and venules, while leukocyte-platelet aggregates were  found only in venules. Microthrombi occluded up to 70% of venules and 33% of  arterioles. The current data suggest that the immediate post-traumatic decrease  in peri-contusional blood flow is not caused by arteriolar vasoconstriction, but  by platelet activation and the subsequent formation of thrombi in the cerebral  microcirculation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The glycoprotein erythropoietin (EPO) has been shown to be protective in models of neuronal disease and reduced apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells  (RGC) after transection of the optic nerve and in glaucoma. In this study we  assessed in vivo the properties of EPO on survival of RGC after ischemia and  optic nerve compression, as well as on postischemic visual function. Furthermore,  the safety of intravitreal injection was assessed. METHODS: In all experiments,  EPO was administered intravitreally in male Brown Norway rats. Ocular ischemia  was induced by elevating the intraocular pressure for 55 min. The calibrated  optic nerve compression was performed for 10 s. RGC were marked stereotactically  and quantified by fluorescence microscopy. The retinal function was quantified by  electroretinography (ERG) and the whole visual pathway by visual evoked potential  (VEP). RESULTS: EPO (2 and 20 units per eye, n=9-21) increased the survival of  RGC after ischemia by 21+/-21% and 127+/-31% (mean +/- SEM) and after optic nerve  compression by 28+/-12% and 58+/-13%. With EPO (20 units), postischemic function  was increased, in ERG by 71+/-13% (a-wave) and 75+/-19% (b-wave) and in VEP by  264+/-65% (p=0.053). Neither the ERG parameters, nor the VEP, nor the number of  RGC differed significantly after intravitreal injection of EPO (5, 50, and 200  units, n=6-7) in healthy eyes. CONCLUSION: The combination of toxicological  safety and protection of retinal neurons makes EPO a promising drug for ischemic  retinal diseases and traumatic optic neuropathy.

AB  - PURPOSE: To compare four methods of volume recruitment upon initiation of high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV). METHODS: Anesthetized intubated  neonatal piglets (n = 10) underwent repeated saline lavage, followed by  conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV). After transition to HFOV at a mean  airway pressure 8 cmH2O above CMV (P(basal)), four methods of lung volume  recruitment were tested in each animal in random order: Escalating--step-wise  pressure increments over 6 min to a peak mean airway pressure 12 cmH2O above  P(basal); Sustained dynamic inflation (DI)--a 20 s inflation to the same peak  pressure; DI repeated six times for 1 s; Standard--mean airway pressure set  directly at P(basal). After each recruitment method, HFOV continued at P(basal)  for 15 min. Thoracic gas volume and distribution of aeration were determined by  single slice computed tomography, and oxygenation by arterial blood gas sampling.  RESULTS: Escalating recruitment resulted in the greatest thoracic gas volume 15  min post recruitment [77 +/- 3.3% of total lung capacity vs. 70 +/- 4.2%  (Sustained DI), 65 +/- 3.5% (Repeated DI),63 +/- 5.1% (Standard); mean +/- SEM; P  = 0.042, ANOVA]. All methods resulted in a reduction in non-aerated lung, with  the greatest redistribution to normally aerated lung being with Escalating  recruitment. Oxygenation 15 min post recruitment was better with the Escalating  method than with Repeated DI or Standard recruitment (pO2 307 +/- 41 vs. 159 +/-  36 vs. 134 +/- 39 mmHg, respectively; P = 0.016, ANOVA). CONCLUSIONS: Escalating  recruitment produced the greatest increase in lung volume and resolution of  atelectasis, and is recommended for lung volume recruitment upon initiation of  HFOV.

AB  - Femoral arterial lines are used for continuous monitoring of arterial blood pressure in experimental studies. However, placement of a catheter in the femoral  artery could produce acute limb ischemia with associated systemic effects. The  aim of this study was to investigate the effect of femoral arterial line  insertion on liver function, in a rabbit liver lobar ischemia-reperfusion (I/R)  model. Four groups of animals (n = 6 each) were studied: groups 1 and 2 (sham)  underwent laparotomy but no liver ischemia. In groups 3 and 4 (I/R), liver lobar  ischemia was induced for 60 minutes followed by 7 hours of reperfusion. In groups  1 and 3, the arterial line was placed in the femoral artery whereas in groups 2  and 4 in the ear artery. Liver function was assessed by serum alanine  aminotransferase (ALT) activity, bile flow, plasma lactate levels, and histology.  Results are expressed as mean +/- SEM. Alanine aminotransferase activity and  lactate levels were significantly higher in the I/R femoral line group compared  with the I/R ear line group at 7 hours postreperfusion. Bile production was  significantly lower (75 +/- 9.6 vs 112 +/- 10 microL/min per 100 g liver weight).  Histopathology showed more extensive hepatocellular necrosis and neutrophil  accumulation in the I/R femoral line group compared with I/R ear line group. The  sham femoral group showed liver injury, which was more marked than the ear line  group (all P < .05). In conclusion, femoral artery cannulation induces remote  liver injury. The use of femoral arterial lines should be avoided in experimental  studies concerning liver function.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between a measure of skin and tissue water, subepidermal moisture (SEM), and visual assessment of early pressure ulcer  (PU) damage in nursing home (NH) residents with dark skin tones. DESIGN, SETTING,  AND PARTICIPANTS: Descriptive, cohort study with 66 residents in 4 US NH.  METHODS: Data were pooled from 2 previous NH studies to evaluate persons with  dark skin tones. Data were analyzed for concurrent visual assessments and SEM,  which were obtained at the right and left buttocks and sacrum weekly for 20  weeks. Subepidermal moisture was measured with a surface electrical capacitance  dermal phase meter, where higher readings indicate greater SEM (range: 0-999  dermal phase units [DPUs]). Visual assessment was rated as normal, erythema/stage  I PU, or stage II+ PU. Subepidermal moisture and specific SEM threshold values  (50, 150, 300 DPU) were modeled as detectors of visual assessment of early PU 1  week later (controlling for clustering and incontinence); with concurrent SEM,  and PU risk status, in separate analyses for persons with light and dark skin  tones. RESULTS: Participants had a mean age of 84 years, 83% were female, and 77%  were non-Hispanic white. Higher SEM predicted greater likelihood of  erythema/stage I PU and stage II+ PU in persons with dark skin tones the next  week (OR = 1.88 for every 100 DPU increase in SEM, P = .004). When SEM was  greater than 50, 150, and 300 DPU, persons with dark skin tones were 8.5, 13, and  10 times more likely to present with stage II+ PU the following week compared to  persons with light skin who were 7.2, 3.5, and 4.3 times more likely to present  with stage II PU (50, 150, 300 DPU, respectively). Subepidermal moisture  threshold of 50 DPU was also significant for detecting erythema/stage I PU in  persons with dark skin tones (OR = 5.3, 95% CI, 1.87-15.11, P < .001).  CONCLUSIONS: Subepidermal moisture was associated with future (1 week later) PU  in persons with dark skin tones. Subepidermal moisture threshold values may  assist in detecting early PU in persons with dark skin tones, allowing for  earlier intervention to prevent PU. These findings should be further evaluated in  persons with dark skin tones.

AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of early rapid control of multiple bowel perforations on cardiovascular function in combined abdominal  missile trauma and haemorrhagic shock compared with conventional surgery.  METHODS: Eighteen anesthetised pigs were injured with a standardised abdominal  missile trauma. The animals were bled to a mean arterial pressure of 50 mm Hg for  30 minutes, after which they were resuscitated and had laparotomy. They were  divided into conventional surgery group (n=9) with primary resection and  anastomosis of bowel -injuries and early rapid multiple bowel ligation group  (n?=?9). Repeated measurement analysis of variance was used for analysis.  RESULTS: There was profound hypotension, reduced cardiac output, increased  vascular resistance and lactic acidaemia in both groups. Lactic acidaemia  persisted longer in the early rapid multiple bowel ligation group. There were no  significant differences in mean arterial pressure, cardiac output , stroke volume  or systemic vascular resistance between the groups. The mean operation time was  significantly shorter in the early rapid multiple bowel ligation group (13.3  (1.5) (SEM) minutes, compared with 116.4 (1.74) (SEM) minutes in the conventional  surgery group, p =0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Damage control principles have shortened  the operating time in our model but did not improve the cardiovascular function  and caused more lactic acidaemia than conventional repair.

AB  - OBJECT: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the time course for cerebral autoregulation (AR) recovery following severe traumatic brain injury (TBI).  METHODS: Thirty-six patients (27 males and 9 females, mean +/- SEM age 33 +/-  15.1 years) with severe TBI underwent serial dynamic AR studies with leg cuff  deflation as a stimulus, until recovery of the AR responses was measured.  RESULTS: The AR was impaired (AR index < 2.8) in 30 (83%) of 36 patients on Days  3-5 after injury, and in 19 individuals (53%) impairments were found on Days 9-11  after the injury. Nine (25%) of 36 patients exhibited a poor AR response (AR  index < 1) on postinjury Days 12-14, which eventually recovered on Days 15-23.  Fifty-eight percent of the patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3-5, 50%  of those with diffuse brain injury, 54% of those with elevated intracranial  pressure, and 40% of those with poor outcome had no AR recovery in the first 11  days after injury. CONCLUSIONS: Autoregulation recovery after severe TBI can be  delayed, and failure to recover during the 2nd week after injury occurs mainly in  patients with a lower Glasgow Coma Scale score, diffuse brain injury, elevated  ICP, or unfavorable outcome. The finding suggests that perfusion pressure  management should be considered in some of the patients for a period of at least  2 weeks.

AB  - PURPOSE: Glaucoma is a common neurodegenerative disease for which current therapies are often insufficient; thus, new neuroprotective strategies are an  important goal. Stem cells are attracting increasing attention as mediators of  neuroprotection, often conferred via the trophic support of injured neurons. The  purpose of our investigation was to determine whether oligodendrocyte precursor  cells (OPCs), a type of neural stem cell, can protect retinal ganglion cells  (RGCs) from glaucomatous damage in vivo. METHODS: Intraocular pressure was  chronically increased by trabecular laser treatment delivered unilaterally to  adult rat eyes. OPCs were isolated in vitro and then transplanted intravitreally  either before, or concurrent with, injury induction. Survival, migration,  differentiation, and integration of grafted cells were assessed by  immunohistochemistry. RGC survival was assessed by optic nerve axon  quantification. RESULTS: Transplanted OPCs were found to survive within the eye  for at least 12 weeks and to localize close to the RGCs. Moreover, OPCs  significantly enhanced the survival of RGCs in the glaucomatous eye, but only  when concomitantly activated by inflammation. Axonal loss relative to the  untreated fellow eye was 28.34% +/- 11.51% in eyes that received activated OPCs,  compared with 60.34% +/- 8.28% in control eyes (mean +/- SEM; P = 0.05).  Amelioration of RGC death was not attributable to inflammation but relied on an  interaction between inflammatory cells and OPCs. Engrafted cells also displayed  multipotentiality in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: The impressive neuroprotection conferred  by OPCs in this model suggests stem cell-based therapies should be explored  further as a potential treatment for glaucoma.

AB  - BACKGROUND: HemCon bandage (HC) and QuikClot granules (QC) have been deployed for the past 5 years for treating external hemorrhage in combat casualties. We  examined efficacy and initial safety of three new hemostatic granules/powders in  a swine extremity arterial hemorrhage model that was 100% fatal with army  standard gauze treatment. The new products were compared with the most advanced  forms of HC and QC products. METHODS: Anesthetized pigs (37 kg, n = 46) were  instrumented, splenectomized, and their femoral arteries were isolated and  injured (6 mm arteriotomy). After 45 seconds free bleeding, a test agent  [WoundStat (WS), super quick relief (SQR), Celox (CX)] or a control product [HC  or QC bead bags (advanced clotting sponge plus)] was applied to the wounds and  compressed with a large gauze for 2 minutes. Fluid resuscitation (colloid and  crystalloid) was given and titrated to a mean arterial pressure of 65 mm Hg.  Animals were observed for 180 minutes or until death. Computed tomography  angiography was performed on survivors and tissue samples were collected form  wounds for histologic examination. RESULTS: No differences were found in baseline  measurements and pretreatment blood loss (17.4 mL/kg +/- 0.5 mL/kg, mean +/- SEM)  among groups. Advanced clotting sponge plus testing was halted after six  unsuccessful attempts (no hemostasis observed) whereas other agents were tested  each in 10 animals. Stable hemostasis was achieved in 10 (WS), 7 (SQR), 6 (CX),  and 1 (HC) subjects in each group, resulting in the recovery of mean arterial  pressure and survival of the animals for 3 hours (p < 0.05, SQR or WS vs. HC).  Posttreatment blood loss was significantly reduced with the use of the new agents  (CX = 40 +/- 16.6, SQR = 34.5 +/- 16.3, WS = 9.5 mL/kg +/- 5.2 mL/kg) as compared  with HC (85.6 mL/kg +/- 10 mL/kg, p < 0.05). The granular treated animals lived  for 180 (WS), 164 +/- 8.2 (SQR) and 138 +/- 17.7 (CX) minutes, significantly (p <  0.05) longer than the HC (83.3 +/- 12 minutes) group. A significant (p < 0.05)  rise in temperature (53.5 degrees C +/- 1.8 degrees C) over baseline (36.5  degrees C +/- 0.3 degrees C) was measured only in the wounds treated with SQR.  Computed tomography images showed no blood flow through treated vessels.  Histologic evidence indicated the least tissue damage with HC, moderate damage  with WS and CX, and most damage including axonal necrosis with SQR. CONCLUSION:  The new hemostatic agents are significantly more effective in treating arterial  hemorrhage than currently deployed products. Among them, WS granules appear to be  most efficacious, followed by SQR and CX powders. The clinical significance of  tissue damage caused by these agents and any potential risk of embolism with  procoagulant granular/powder products are unknown and warrant survival studies.

AB  - Severe haemorrhage leads to a reflex bradycardia and hypotension. This is thought to be protective, but is attenuated by both concomitant musculoskeletal injury  and exogenous morphine. The aim of this study was to determine whether the  injury-induced attenuation of the response to severe haemorrhage could be blocked  by naloxone. Male Wistar rats, terminally anaesthetized with  alphadolone/alphaxalone (19-20 mg kg(-1) h(-1)I.V.), were randomly allocated to  one of four groups. In groups I and IV, haemorrhage was simple [40% of estimated  total blood volume (BV)], while in groups II and III it was initiated 10 min  after the onset of bilateral hindlimb ischaemia (a model of musculoskeletal  injury). Groups I and II received 20 microl of 0.9% saline  intracerebroventricularly (I.C.V.) immediately before haemorrhage, while groups  III and IV received 20 microg of naloxone I.C.V., in the same volume. In group I,  the bradycardia reached its peak after the loss of 32.8 +/- 0.3% BV (mean +/-  S.E.M.). Blood pressure did not fall significantly until the loss of 15.0 +/-  3.0% BV. The response in group IV was not significantly different from group I.  By contrast, the bradycardia was absent after similar blood losses in groups II  and III, while hypotension was attenuated. These results indicate that naloxone,  at a dose known to be effective in blocking mu-opioid receptors and preventing  other aspects of the response to injury, does not prevent the injury-induced  attenuation of the response to severe haemorrhage. Thus the attenuation of the  response to blood loss by injury is unlikely to be mediated via the mu-opioid  receptors.

AB  - Reliability is a population-specific property, but to the authors' knowledge there has been no study to determine the test-retest reliability of the postural  stability measures such as center of pressure (COP) measures in the population of  patients with musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), while their clinical applications  have been presented in literature. So, 33 patients with low back pain (LBP),  anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury and functional ankle instability (FAI)  randomly completed postural measurements with three levels of difficulty (rigid  surface-eyes open, rigid surface-eyes closed, and foam surface-eyes closed) in  two sessions. COP data were used to calculate standard deviation of amplitude,  standard deviation of velocity, phase plane portrait, mean total velocity and  area (95% confidence ellipse). Relative reliability of these measures was  assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and absolute reliability  using standard error of measurement (SEM) and coefficient of variation (CV).  Also, minimal metrically detectable change (MMDC) was calculated to quantify  intervention effects. Among different COP parameters, mean total velocity in all  conditions of postural difficulty showed high to very high reliability, with ICC  range of 0.74-0.91, SEM range of 0.09-0.40cm/s, CV range of 5.31-8.29% and MMDC  range of 0.19-0.79cm/s. Phase plane portrait in anteroposterior-mediolateral  (AP-ML) and ML direction were other best parameters with respect to the level of  reliability. Mean total velocity and phase plane portrait parameters are  suggested as good candidates to use for quantification and assessment of balance  performance and identifying those with MSDs.

AB  - Although it has long been recognized that thyroid hormone is an effective positive inotrope, its efficacy in supporting hemodynamics in the acute setting  of ischaemia and reperfusion (R) without worsening reperfusion injury remains  largely unknown. Thus, we investigated the effects of triiodothyronine (T3) on  reperfusion injury in a Langendorff-perfused rat heart model of 30 min zero-flow  ischaemia and 60 min of (R) with or without T3 (40 microg/l) at R, T3-R60, n = 11  and CNT-R60, n = 10, respectively. Furthermore, phosphorylated levels of  intracellular kinases were measured at 5, 15 and 60 min of R. T3 markedly  improved postischaemic recovery of left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP%);  56.0% (SEM, 4.4) in T3-R60 versus 38.8% (3.1) in CNT-R60, P < 0.05. Furthermore,  LDH release was significantly lower in T3-R60. Apoptosis detection by fluorescent  probe optical imaging showed increased fluorescent signal in CNT-R60 hearts,  while the signal was hardly detectable in T3-R60 hearts. Similarly, caspase-3  activity was found to be 78.2 (8.2) in CNT-R60 vs 40.5 (7.1) in T3-R60 hearts, P  < 0.05. This response was associated with significantly lower levels of  phospho-p38 MAPK at any time point of R. No significant changes in phospho-  ERK1/2 and JNK levels were observed between groups. Phospho-Akt levels were  significantly lower in T3 treated group at 5 min and no change in phospho-Akt  levels were observed at 15 and 60 min between groups. In conclusion, T3  administration at reperfusion can improve postischaemic recovery of function  while limiting apoptosis. This may constitute a paradigm of a positive inotropic  agent with anti-apoptotic action suitable for supporting hemodynamics in the  clinical setting of ischaemia-reperfusion.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The  experiments were conducted > or =4-5 weeks after spinal cord transection at the  T9-T10 level. PES was applied via a pair of hook electrodes to the perianal skin  area in three awake female cats with chronic SCI. A double-lumen balloon catheter  was inserted through the urethra into the bladder to monitor bladder pressure and  infuse saline (2-4 mL/min). RESULTS: Under isovolumetric conditions PES at 3-10  Hz significantly inhibited large-amplitude reflex bladder activity induced by  bladder distension above the micturition volume threshold. However, PES at 20-50  Hz induced large-amplitude bladder contractions when the bladder volume was below  the micturition volume threshold. Inhibitory PES (7 Hz) significantly increased  the mean (sem) bladder capacity by 40 (10)% when it was applied continuously  during cystometrography. The optimum excitatory PES (30 Hz) induced  large-amplitude (>25 cmH(2)O), long-duration (>20 s) bladder contractions at a  wide range of bladder volumes (10-90% of bladder capacity). CONCLUSIONS: This  study showed that activation of pudendal afferent fibres by PES could induce  frequency-dependent reflex bladder responses in awake cats with chronic SCI,  indicating that a possible noninvasive treatment based on PES could be developed  to restore both continence and micturition function for patients with SCI.

AB  - PURPOSE: Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HOT) consists of intermittent inhalations of 100% oxygen at a pressure higher than 1 atm. It is an important adjuvant therapy  in pathological processes like soft tissue infections, radiation injury, gas  gangrene, osteomyelitis and decompressive diseases. Cisplatin, a potent  antineoplastic drug, widely used in cancer therapy is highly ototoxic causing  bilateral, irreversible damage to the hearing of high frequency sounds (4-8 KHz).  OBJECTIVE: This experimental study conducted at the Faculty of Medicine of  Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo aims to evaluate Hyperbaric Oxygen  Therapy as an otoprotection agent against drug toxicity. METHODS: Albino guinea  pigs were divided into two groups: in Group A, 5 animals (10 cochlea) received  cisplatin, i. p., 8.0 mg/kg/day during three days and afterwards were submitted  to HOT; in Group B, 3 animals (6 cochlea) received cisplatin, i. p. 8.0 mg/kg/day  during three days. Guinea pigs were evaluated by acoustic otoemissions (AOE) and  scanning electron microscopy (SEM). RESULTS: Group B animals showed loss of  auditory functions as measured by AOE and distorted outer hair cells by SEM. In  Group A, outer hair cells shown by SEM images were mostly preserved. CONCLUSION:  It is presumed that Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy has a protector effect against  cisplatin ototoxicity.

AB  - Inactivity and muscular adaptations following spinal cord injury (SCI) result in secondary complications such as cardiovascular disease, obesity, and pressure  sores. Functional electrically stimulated (FES) cycling can potentially reduce  these complications, but previous studies have provided inconsistent results. We  studied the effect of intensive long-term FES cycle training on muscle properties  in 11 SCI subjects (mean +/- SEM: 41.8 +/- 2.3 years) who had trained for up to 1  hour/day, 5 days/week, for 1 year. Comparative measurements were made in 10  able-bodied (AB) subjects. Quadriceps maximal electrically stimulated torque  increased fivefold (n = 5), but remained lower than in AB individuals. Relative  force response at 1 HZ decreased, relaxation rate remained unchanged, and fatigue  resistance improved significantly. Power output (PO) improved to a lesser extent  than quadriceps torque and not to a greater extent than has been reported  previously. We need to understand the factors that limit PO in order to maximize  the benefits of FES cycling.

T2  - Regulatory peptides
AB  - Endothelin-1 is involved in physiology and pathophysiology of the alimentary tract. The peptide modulates blood flow in the gastrointestinal microvasculature  and regulates contractility of smooth muscles and, when present in excess, may be  an important factor contributing to pathogenesis of various forms of mucosal  injury and peristaltic disorders. Mechanisms that regulate endothelin  concentration in the gastrointestinal tissues are unknown. Therefore, the aim of  our study was to identify and characterize endothelin inactivating peptidases in  the rat gastrointestinal mucosa and smooth muscle cells. We have found three high  affinity and efficient endothelin-1 inactivating peptidases. The acidic (pH  optimum 5.5), membrane-bound, thiorphan- (ED(50) 1.2+/-0.2 nM) and phosphoramidon  (ED(50) 150+/-25 pM) sensitive, endothelin-1 inactivating peptidase (K(M)  0.12+/-0.03 microM) was present in the mucosal cells of duodenum and small  intestine. The enzyme exhibited high molecular weight (>100 kDa) and  characteristics similar to that of the rat and human kidney, acidic  metalloendopeptidase that was recently described. Two forms of the unique, low  molecular weight (100>MW>30 kDa), alkaline (pH optimum 8.5), specific (K(M)  0.5+/-0.2 microM), thiorphan- and phosphoramidon insensitive, 1,10 phenanthroline  inhibitable (ED(50) 0.65+/-0.20 mM, mean+/-S.E.M.) endothelin-1 inactivating  peptidase were present exclusively in the duodenal mucosal cells; soluble form in  cytosol and membrane-bound form exhibiting an abundance ratio 5:1, respectively.  Mucosa of the stomach and large intestine, and gastrointestinal smooth muscle  cells do not contain the specific endothelin-1 inactivating peptidases. The  enzymes may play a crucial role in regulation of endothelin concentration in the  gastrointestinal tissues. Whether impairment of activity of the mucosal  endothelin inactivating peptidases, resulting in the increase of concentration of  endothelin peptides in gastrointestinal tissues, occurs in various pathological  conditions is actually studied in our laboratory.

AB  - The present study describes the production of hyaluronan based porous microparticles by a semi-continuous gas anti-solvent (GAS) precipitation process  to be used as a growth factor delivery system for in vivo treatment of ulcers.  Operative process conditions, such as pressure, nozzle diameter and HYAFF11  solution concentrations, were adjusted to optimize particle production in terms  of morphology and size. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and light scattering  demonstrated that porous nano-structured particles with a size of 300 and 900 nm  had a high specific surface suitable for absorption of growth factors from the  aqueous environment within the polymeric matrix. Water acted as a plasticizer,  enhancing growth factor absorption. Water contents within the HYAFF11 matrix were  analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The absorption process was  developed using fluorescence dyes and growth factors. Immunohistochemical  analysis confirmed the high efficiency of absorption of growth factor and a  mathematical model was generated to quantify and qualify the in vitro kinetics of  growth factor release within the polymeric matrix. In vivo experiments were  performed with the aim to optimize timed and focal release of PDGF to promote  optimal tissue repair and regeneration of full-thickness wounds.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nonoperative management (NOM) of low-grade blunt pancreatic injuries (LGBPI) diagnosed by computed tomographic (CT) abnormalities of the pancreas in  the adult hemodynamically stable (HDS) patient has not been previously defined.  We report our experience of patients with LGBPI at a single Level I Trauma  Center. METHODS: Adult HDS patients during a 5-year period with blunt pancreatic  injuries with an abbreviated injury score of </=2 were identified through the  hospital trauma registry. Management, complications, and outcome were reviewed.  Patients who underwent initial emergency laparotomy, died on hospital day one, or  had a Glasgow Coma Scale of three were excluded. Failure of NOM was defined by  need for subsequent exploratory laparotomy or development of a pancreatic  complication. Data are reported as mean +/- SEM. RESULTS: A total of 120 patients  were identified as having blunt pancreatic injury of which 35, with pancreatic  abbreviated injury score of </=2, were blunt HDS patients with abdominal CT  evidence of pancreatic injury. Amylase elevation was noted in 23 of 35 (68.5%)  patients with positive CT scan findings of LGBPI. Study population consisted of  20 male patients and 15 female patients, age 32 +/- 13.22, injury severity score  21 +/- 10.08, systolic pressure 123 +/- 27.06 with mean base deficit -3.78 +/- 2.  Of these 12 (34.28%) patients had an associated intra-abdominal solid organ  injury. Five patients failed NOM (F-NOM), one had missed small bowel injury,  three had pancreatic abscess, of which one developed a pancreatic fistula which  resolved with medical management, and one F-NOM for blunt liver injury with  missed bowel injury. No death in the F-NOM group and two deaths (5.71%) in the  successful NOM (S-NOM) group unrelated to the pancreas. The average length of  stay was 11 days +/- 9.71 days. CONCLUSION: NOM of LGBPI diagnosed by CT was  successful in the majority of HDS patients, with low morbidity and mortality. We  propose a management algorithm for NOM of LGBPI in which the role for early  ductal injury detection with endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatogram or  magnetic retrograde cholangio-pancreatogram should be incorporated to better  analyze the most appropriate treatment.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that head-down positioning in anesthetized horses increases intracranial pressure (ICP) and decreases cerebral and spinal  cord blood flows. ANIMALS: 6 adult horses. PROCEDURES: For each horse, anesthesia  was induced with ketamine hydrochloride and xylazine hydrochloride and maintained  with 1.57% isoflurane in oxygen. Once in right lateral recumbency, horses were  ventilated to maintain normocapnia. An ICP transducer was placed in the  subarachnoid space, and catheters were placed in the left cardiac ventricle and  in multiple vessels. Blood flow measurements were made by use of a fluorescent  microsphere technique while each horse was in horizontal and head-down positions.  Inferential statistical analyses were performed via repeated-measures ANOVA and  Dunn-Sidak comparisons. RESULTS: Because 1 horse developed extreme hypotension,  data from 5 horses were analyzed. During head-down positioning, mean +/- SEM ICP  increased to 55+/-2 mm Hg, compared with 31+/-2 mm Hg during horizontal  positioning; cerebral perfusion pressure was unchanged. Compared with findings  during horizontal positioning, blood flow to the cerebrum, cerebellum, and  cranial portion of the brainstem decreased significantly by approximately 20%  during head-down positioning; blood flows within the pons and medulla were mildly  but not significantly decreased. Spinal cord blood flow was low (9 mL/min/100 g  of tissue) and unaffected by position. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE:  Head-down positioning increased heart-brain hydrostatic gradients in  isoflurane-anesthetized horses, thereby decreasing cerebral blood flow and, to a  greater extent, increasing ICP. During anesthesia, CNS regions with low blood  flows in horses may be predisposed to ischemic injury induced by high ICP.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Agents inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAAS) system have an important role in slowing the progression of chronic kidney disease. We  evaluated the hypothesis that the addition of an aldosterone receptor antagonist  to an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and angiotensin II type 1  (AT-1) receptor blocker (ARB) (triple RAAS blockade) may provide an additional  benefit compared with an ACE inhibitor and ARB (double RAAS blockade). DESIGN:  Randomized open controlled crossover study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 18 whites (7  women, 11 men) from the Outpatient Department of Nephrology with chronic  nondiabetic proteinuric kidney diseases, mean age 42.4 +/- 1.9 years (SEM).  INTERVENTIONS: In the 8-week run-in period, all participants received the ACE  inhibitor cilazapril (5 mg), the ARB telmisartan (80 mg), and the diuretic  hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg) as double RAAS blockade to achieve the target blood  pressure of less than 130/80 mm Hg. Participants were then randomly assigned to 2  treatment sequences, either the addition of spironolactone (25 mg) (triple RAAS  blockade) through 8 weeks followed by double RAAS blockade through 8 weeks  (sequence 1) or double RAAS blockade followed by triple RAAS blockade (sequence  2). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 24-hour urine protein excretion (primary end point)  and markers of tubular injury and fibrosis (secondary end points). Analysis was  performed using analysis of variance for repeated measurements. RESULTS: At  baseline, mean serum creatinine level was 1.16 +/- 0.09 mg/dL (103 +/- 8  micromol/L), estimated glomerular filtration rate was 107.8 mL/min (95%  confidence interval, 93 to 140.9 [1.8 mL/s; 95% confidence interval, 1.55 to  2.35; Cockcroft-Gault formula), and 24-hour mean proteinuria was 0.97 +/- 0.18 g.  Mean urine protein excretion was 0.7 g/24 h (95% confidence interval, 0.48 to  0.92) less after triple RAAS blockade than after double RAAS blockade (P = 0.01),  without change in blood pressure. Urine excretion of  N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase (P = 0.02) and amino-terminal propeptide of type  III procollagen (P = 0.05) also significantly decreased. Potassium levels  increased significantly after triple therapy (P = 0.02). However, no patient was  withdrawn because of adverse effects. LIMITATIONS: Absence of blinding, small  sample size, short treatment period, absence of histological assessment.  CONCLUSIONS: Administration of an aldosterone receptor antagonist in addition to  double RAAS blockade with an ACE inhibitor and ARB may slow the progression of  chronic kidney disease. Additional studies are necessary to confirm this result.

AB  - Although famotidine was reported to be 7.5 and 20 times more potent than ranitidine and cimetidine, respectively, its oral bioavailability is low and  variable; due mainly to its poor aqueous solubility. The purpose of this study  was to improve famotidine dissolution through its formulation into liquisolid  systems and then to investigate the in vitro and in vivo performance of the  prepared liquisolid tablets. The new mathematical model was utilized to formulate  various liquisolid powder systems. Both DSC and XRD suggested loss of famotidine  crystallinity upon liquisolid formulation which was further confirmed by SEM  indicating that even though the drug existed in a solid dosage form, it is held  within the powder substrate in a solubilized, almost molecularly dispersed state,  which contributed to the enhanced drug dissolution properties. All the tested  liquisolid tablet formulations showed higher drug dissolution rates (DR) than the  conventional, directly compressed tables. In addition, the selected optimal  formula released 78.36% of its content during the first 10 min which is 39%  higher than that of the directly compressed tablets. Further, the bioavailability  study indicated that the prepared optimal liquisolid formula did not differ  significantly from the marketed famotidine tablets concerning Cmax, tmax, and  AUC(0-8) at P<0.05.

AB  - The objective of this descriptive cohort study was to examine the relationship between subepidermal moisture (SEM) and visual assessment of early pressure  ulcers (PUs) in 31 nursing home (NH) residents residing in two NHs. Concurrent  visual assessments and SEM were obtained at the sacrum, right and left  trochanters, buttocks, and ischium weekly for 20 weeks. Visual assessment was  rated as normal, erythema, stage I PU, or stage II+ PU. SEM, measured with a  dermal phase meter where higher readings indicate greater SEM (range: 0-999  dermal phase units [DPU]), was modeled as a predictor of concurrent visual  assessment of skin damage and erythema and stage I PUs at the sacrum 1 week later  with covariate PU risk. Participants had a mean age of 84.1 years, were 83%  female, 72% non-Hispanic white. SEM was lowest for normal skin (104 DPU, SD 114),  higher for erythema (185 DPU, SD 138), stage I PUs (264 DPU, SD 208), and highest  for stage II+ PUs (727 DPU, SD 287) across all sites (all p<0.01). SEM was  responsive to visual assessment changes, differentiated between erythema and  stage I PU, and higher SEM predicted greater likelihood of erythema/stage I PU at  the sacrum the next week (odds ratio=1.32 for every 100 DPU increase, p=0.03).  SEM was associated with concurrent skin damage and future (1 week later)  development of sacral erythema/stage I PUs. SEM differentiates between erythema  and stage I PUs. SEM may assist in predicting early PU damage, allowing for  earlier intervention to prevent PUs.

Since adenosine is known to be a major trigger of ischemic  preconditioning, we hypothesized that A(1) adenosine receptor (A(1)AR) activation  plays a role in sildenafil-induced cardioprotective signaling. Adult male C57BL  wild-type (WT) mice or their corresponding A(1)AR knockout (A(1)AR-KO) mice were  treated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with either sildenafil (0.71 mg/kg, equivalent  to 50 mg dose for a 70 kg patient) or volume-matched saline. The selective A(1)AR  antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropyxanthine (DPCPX; 0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) was  administered 30 min before sildenafil. The hearts were isolated 24 h later and  subjected to 30 min of global ischemia and 1 h of reperfusion in Langendorff  mode. Post-ischemic myocardial infarct size (mean+/-SEM; % of risk area) was  reduced in C57BL-WT mice treated with sildenafil (5.6+/-0.9) versus saline  control group (27.3+/-2.1; p<0.05; n=6/each). However, sildenafil failed to  protect the A(1)AR-KO hearts (31.6+/-1.9 vs. 32.3+/-1.5 with saline, p>0.05).  Additionally, DPCPX treatment abolished the infarct limiting effect of sildenafil  (27.3+/-3.2, p<0.05). DPCPX alone had no effect on infarct size as compared with  the control group. No significant changes in post-ischemic recovery of left  ventricular pressure and heart rate were observed in the sildenafil-treated  group. We further examined the effect of sildenafil in protection against  simulated ischemia and reoxygenation injury in adult cardiomyocytes derived from  WT and A(1)AR-KO mice. WT myocytes treated with sildenafil (1 microM)  demonstrated significantly lower trypan blue-positive necrotic cells. However,  cardiomyocytes derived from A(1)AR-KO mice or DPCPX-treated WT cells failed to  show protection against necrosis with sildenafil. These results suggest that  A(1)AR activation following treatment with sildenafil plays an integral role in  the signaling cascade responsible for delayed protection against global I/R  injury.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the relationship between a measure of subepidermal moisture (SEM) and visual skin assessment (VSA) of erythema and Stage 1 pressure  ulcers (PUs) performed a week later in nursing home (NH) residents. DESIGN:  Descriptive, cohort study. SETTING: Two NHs. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-five residents.  METHODS: Concurrent VSAs and SEM readings were obtained at the sacrum, right and  left trochanters, buttocks, and ischial tuberosities weekly for 52 weeks. SEM was  measured using a handheld dermal phase meter, with higher readings indicating  greater SEM (range 0-999 dermal phase units [DPUs]). VSA was rated as normal,  erythema/Stage 1 PU, or Stage 2+PU. SEM was modeled as a predictor of VSA of  erythema and PUs 1 week later (controlling for clustering), with concurrent  moisture, Braden Scale PU risk status, anatomic site, and ethnicity as  covariates. RESULTS: Participants had a mean age of 84.7, 83% were female, and  80% were non-Hispanic white. SEM measures were lowest for normal skin (97+/-122  DPU), higher for erythema/Stage 1 PUs (192+/-188 DPU), and highest for Stage  2+PUs (569+/-320 DPU) across all sites (all P<.001). SEM was responsive to  changes in VSA, and higher SEM predicted greater likelihood of erythema/Stage 1  PU the next week (odds ratio=1.26 for every 100-DPU increase in SEM, P=.04).  CONCLUSION: SEM measures are associated with concurrent erythema and PUs and  future (1 week later) development of erythema/Stage 1 PUs. SEM may assist in  predicting early PU damage, allowing for earlier intervention to prevent skin  damage.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Several types of renal disease progress at a faster rate in men compared with women, but the reasons for this sex difference are not well  understood. Chronic renal disease is associated with elevated levels of toxic  reactive oxygen species (ROS). Superoxide, the major ROS in the kidney, is  generated by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase.  OBJECTIVE: To determine if female protection from renal disease progression is  consistent with 17beta-estradiol (E2) attenuation of superoxide production, this  study was conducted to assess superoxide production in the renal cortex of male  and female control and renal wrap (RW) rats, as well as in ovariectomized rats  treated with vehicle or E2. METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 2 sham  operation male (Sham-M) and female (Sham-F) control groups, and 4 RW hypertensive  groups: RW-M; RW-F; RW ovariectomized females treated with vehicle (RW-OVX); and  RW ovariectomized females treated with E2, supplied as a 0.24 mg/60-day release  pellet (RW-OVX+E2). All groups were maintained on a high-sodium (4% NaCl) diet  for 6 weeks. RESULTS: Mean (SEM) markers of renal injury and oxidative stress,  including urinary protein (mg/24 h: RW-M, 298 [31] vs RW-F, 169 [22]; P < 0.001),  microalbuminuria (RW/Sham arbitrary units [AU]/24 h: M, 8.78 [0.58] vs F, 4.31  [1.0]; P < 0.005), and malondialdehyde (nmol/24 h: RW-M, 167 [23] vs RW-F, 117  [8.5]; P < 0.05) levels, as well as mean glomerular volume (microm3 x 10(6):  RW-M, 2.25 [0.16] vs RW-F, 1.25 [0.04]; P < 0.001) and the glomerulosclerotic  index (AU: RW-M, 2.64 [0.19] vs RW-F, 1.10 [0.09]; P < 0.001) were greater in  both control and RW males compared with females in the same treatment groups.  Though RW surgery increased mean arterial pressure in both male and female rats,  no sex difference was observed. Under these conditions, mean (SEM) renal cortical  NADPH oxidase activity was 1.3-fold higher in RW males compared with RW females  (relative light units [RLU]/180 sec: RW-M, 4080 [240] vs RW-F, 3200 [260]; P <  0.05). Ovariectomy increased NADPH oxidase activity by 1.4-fold (RLU/180 sec:  RW-OVX, 4520 [184]; P < 0.01) under conditions in which the mean glomerular  volume and glomerulosclerotic index were both increased by 1.5-fold, whereas E2  replacement (RLU/180 sec: RW-OVX+E2, 2745 [440]) prevented these effects.  Furthermore, the effects on NADPH oxidase activity were mirrored by changes in  the protein abundance of NADPH oxidase subunit p22P(phox). CONCLUSION: These  results suggest that E2 protects the female kidney in part by attenuating  injury-induced increases in renal superoxide production.

AB  - PURPOSE: We investigated a new method of muscle precursor cell transfer in the urethra for the treatment of urinary incontinence, consisting of implanting  myofibers with their satellite cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In preliminary  experiments to test the regenerative capacities of satellite cells histological  analysis was performed on days 7 and 30 after the implantation of myofiber cores  in the urethra of 6 female pigs. In the main experiments 11 pigs underwent  baseline urodynamics, followed by endoscopic destruction of the striated urethral  sphincter located around the distal urethra (day 0). On day 30 circular myofiber  strips in 7 experimental cases and adipocytes in 4 controls were implanted in the  proximal urethra. Seven days later (day 37) 1 case was sacrificed to verify  satellite cell activation. On day 60 urodynamics were performed without and with  curarization. Urethral cryosections were immunostained for desmin (activated  satellite cells), fast myosin heavy chain/bungarotoxin (myotubes/acetylcholine  receptors), neurofilament/vesicular acetylcholine transporter (nerve endings) and  CD45/CD68 (inflammatory response). RESULTS: Preliminary histological studies  revealed a myogenic process consisting of myofiber degeneration and satellite  cell activation (day 7), followed by myotube formation replacing parental  myofibers (day 30). In the main experiments endoscopic injury abolished striated  urethral sphincter activity. Implantation of myofiber strips generated a pressure  peak that decreased after curarization (mean+/-SEM 71.5+/-17.8 vs 33.5+/-14.8 cm  H2O, p=0.031) and reappeared 60 minutes later, revealing that this action was  tonic and under neural control. Nerve endings connected to the acetylcholine  receptors of myotubes were observed on day 60. An inflammatory response was  observed only on day 7 in the myofiber implantation group. Adipocyte implantation  resulted in no significant intraurethral pressure changes. CONCLUSIONS: Urethral  implantation of myofibers regenerates as myotubes that exert tonic activity under  neural control. This has potential clinical value as a means to create an  additional striated urethral sphincter.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The current management of pelvic fracture patients who are hemodynamically unstable in the United States consists of aggressive  resuscitation, mechanical stabilization, and angioembolization. Despite this  multidisciplinary approach, our recent analysis confirms an alarming 40%  mortality in these high-risk patients. Therefore, we pursued alternate therapies  to improve patient outcomes. European trauma groups have suggested the technique  of pelvic packing via laparotomy to directly address the venous bleeding that  comprises 85% of pelvic fracture hemorrhage. We hypothesized that a modified  technique of direct preperitoneal pelvic packing (PPP) would reduce the need for  angiography, decrease blood transfusion requirements, and lower mortality.  METHODS: Since September 2004, all patients at our ACS-verified level I trauma  center with hemodynamic instability and pelvic fractures underwent PPP/external  fixation, according to our protocol. Statistics are reported as mean +/- SEM and  analyzed using Student's t test. RESULTS: During the study period, 28 consecutive  patients underwent PPP. There was one protocol deviation of prePPP angiography to  evaluate an extremity vascular injury. The majority were men (68%) with a mean  age of 40 +/- 3.9 years and a mean injury severity score of 55 +/- 3.0. The mean  emergency department (ED) systolic blood pressure was 77 +/- 3.0 mm Hg, heart  rate was 120 +/- 4.3 bpm, and base deficit 13 +/- 0.8 mmol/L. Pelvic fracture  classifications included lateral compression (LC) II (9), anteroposterior  compression (APC) III (8), LC I (3), vertical shear (3), LC III (3), and APC II  (2). Patients required 4 +/- 1.2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) during  82 +/- 13 minutes in the ED. Blood transfusion requirements before postoperative  surgical intensive care unit (SICU) admission compared with the subsequent 24  postoperative hours were significantly different (12 +/- 2.0 versus 6 +/- 1.1; p  = 0.006). The first 4 patients underwent routine angiography postPPP, with 1  undergoing therapeutic embolization; 4 of the subsequent 24 patients underwent  angioembolization with clinical concern of ongoing pelvic hemorrhage. Seven (25%)  patients died from multiple organ failure (2), postinjury myocardial  infarction/pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest (2), invasive mucormycosis  (1), withdrawal of care (1), and closed head injury (1); there were no deaths as  a result of acute blood loss. CONCLUSIONS: PPP is a rapid method for controlling  pelvic fracture-related hemorrhage that can supplant the need for emergent  angiography. There is a significant reduction in blood product transfusion after  PPP, and this approach appears to reduce mortality in this select high-risk group  of patients.

T2  - Journal of clinical laboratory analysis
AB  - The debate continues regarding the possible interference of phenytoin metabolites in phenytoin immunoassays, and its clinical importance for patients with renal  failure. The aim of this study was to compare the results obtained using the  Abbott fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA), Dade enzyme-multiplied  immunoassay technique (EMIT), and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)  to establish the significance of the differences in conditions of renal failure.  Thirty-six adult patients who had been treated with phenytoin and whose renal  function ranged from normal to severely impaired were chosen for this study. In  accordance with previously established validation criteria for analytical methods  for the determination of drugs, a 15% bias from the HPLC phenytoin values was  considered an acceptable limit. The mean (+/-SEM) glomerular filtration rate  (GFR) of the patients was 37.5+/-4.6 mL/min (range = 10-102 mL/min). The mean  values found using FPIA (10.8+/-1.2 microg/mL) and EMIT (10.8+/-1.3 microg/mL)  presented acceptable deviations with respect to HPLC (10.5+/-1.2 microg/mL), and  a high correlation was found among the results (N = 36) of the different methods  (r > or = 0.987, P < 0.001). An FPIA deviation above the 15% bias limit with  respect to HPLC was found only in two cases with very low serum phenytoin  concentrations and low GFR values (< 20 mL/min), although it does not appear to  be important in terms of adjusting drug dosage. According to our data, FPIA and  EMIT gave accurate results for total phenytoin in serum samples from patients  with renal failure.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To partially characterise maggot-secreted antibacterial substances and determine their range of activity against different bacteria. METHOD: Sterile and  non-sterile maggots maintained in the laboratory and taken from chronic wounds of  treated patients were used. Whole body extracts and haemolymph were fractionated  and their range of activity against bacteria was tested using the zone of  inhibition assay. The mode of action of bacterial destruction was examined by  viable counts, influx of K+ and changes in the membrane potential by scanning  electron microscope (SEM). RESULTS: Extracts of sterile and non-sterile maggots  showed an activity of 200 arbitrary units (AU)/ml and 400AU/ml respectively.  Maggots removed from chronic wounds had an activity of 1200AU/ml. Injuring  sterile maggots with a sterile needle doubled the antibacterial activity within  24 hours, while the antibacterial activity of haemolymph increased fourfold after  injury with a sterile needle and sixteenfold with an infected needle. The  fractions with a molecular weight of < 1kDa and 3-10kDa showed antibacterial  activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria including Pseudomonas  aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus  (MRSA) isolated from wounds. The fraction with a molecular weight of < 1kDa lysed  over 90% of the bacteria within 15 minutes by causing an influx of K+ and  changing the membrane potential of bacteria. CONCLUSION: The nature of the  antibacterial materials extracted from maggots not only indicates their ability  to ingest the necrotic tissue on the wound, but also their potential significance  in wound healing,

AB  - BACKGROUND: Exenatide, an incretin mimetic for adjunctive treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), reduced glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) and weight in  30-week placebo-controlled trials. Some patients were followed up in open-label  extensions to provide 'real-world' exenatide clinical experience. OBJECTIVE: The  purpose of this study was to examine the metabolic effects of 2 years of  exenatide treatment in patients with T2DM. METHODS: For this interim analysis,  data were pooled from patients who completed 1 of three 30-week, multicenter,  double-blind, placebo-controlled trials and their open-label extensions. In the  initial trials, subjects were randomized to BID 5-microg exenatide, 10-microg  exenatide, or placebo for 30 weeks. All subjects who enrolled in the extension  phase then received 5-pg exenatide BID for 4 weeks, followed by open-label  treatment with 10-pg exenatide BID. Subjects continued their existing metformin  and/or sulfonylurea regimens. Analyses were conducted on data from all subjects  who had the opportunity to achieve 2 years of exenatide exposure, irrespective of  their treatment arm in the 30-week placebo-controlled trials. RESULTS: A total of  974 patients entered the open-label, extension phase of the trial. Two hundred  eighty-three subjects (mean [SD] age, 57 [10] years; mean [SD] weight, 100[19]  kg; sex, 63% male; mean [SD] body mass index, 34 [6] kg/m(2); mean [SD] HbA(1c),  8.3% [1.0%]) completed 2 years of exenatide treatment. Reductions in mean (SE)  HbA(1c) from baseline to week 30 (-0.9% [0.1%]) were sustained through 2 years  (-1.1% [0.1%]; P < 0.05 vs baseline), with 50% of the population achieving  HbA(1c) < or = 7%. At week 30, exenatide was associated with a significant  reduction in mean (SD) body weight from baseline (-2.1 [0.2] kg), with  progressive reductions after 2 years (-4.7 [0.3] kg; P < 0.001 vs baseline).  Patients with normal baseline alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (132/283 [47%];  normal: female < or =19 IU/L; male < or =30 IU/L) had no significant ALT change.  However, patients with elevated ALT at baseline (151/283 [53%]) had a mean (SEM)  reduction of ALT (-11 [1] IU/L from baseline 38 [1] IU/1; P < 0.05) and 39%  achieved normal ALT by week 104. Patients with elevated ALT at baseline lost  significantly more weight than patients with normal ALT at baseline (P = 0.04).  However, weight change was minimally correlated with baseline ALT (r = -0.09) or  ALT change (r = 0.31). Also, homeostasis model assessment of the beta-cell  function (HOMA-B), blood pressure, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) all  improved. The most frequently reported adverse event was mild-to-moderate nausea.  CONCLUSIONS: In these patients with T2DM, adjunctive exenatide treatment for 2  years was generally well tolerated and resulted in a sustained reduction of  HbA(1c), progressive reduction in weight, and improvements in HOMA-B, blood  pressure, and the hepatic injury biomarkers, AST and ALT.

AB  - Progenitor cell plasticity enhances positive remodeling of damaged tissue. We and others have previously shown that progenitor cells may limit apoptosis and  modulate inflammation in part by the production of growth factors. However,  recent studies suggest that progenitor cells senesce and lose their  differentiation potential with increasing time in culture and passage. We  hypothesize that murine bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are  cardioprotective against ischemia/reperfusion injury in the isolated perfused rat  heart, and that passage number has an adverse effect on MSC activation and  cardioprotection. Adult male and female Sprague-Dawley rat hearts were isolated,  perfused via Langendorff model, and subjected to ischemia/reperfusion. Mouse MSCs  were harvested, cultured, suspended in perfusate, and infused before global index  ischemia. Hearts were assigned to controls or infusion with passage 3, 5, or 10  MSCs. In addition, MSCs in culture were stressed by hypoxia and increasing doses  of endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide). Mesenchymal stem cell activation was  determined by measuring vascular endothelial growth factor production with  enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. All data are reported as mean +/- SEM and were  analyzed with 2-way analysis of variance. Differences are considered significant  if P < 0.05. Passage 3 murine MSC infusion in hearts before ischemia reduced the  depression of left ventricular developed pressure, attenuated the increase of  end-diastolic pressure, and reduced the depression of +dP/dT and -dP/dT. However,  the MSC protective effect disappeared in hearts infused with passage 5 and  passage 10 MSCs. Although hypoxia and lipopolysaccharide resulted in significant  activation of MSCs, passage 3 MSCs demonstrated significantly greater vascular  endothelial growth factor release than passage 5 and 10 MSCs. Acute murine MSC  infusion confers protection in isolated rat hearts. However, high passage number  has an adverse effect on MSC activation and protection. This portends limited ex  vivo expansion before possible therapeutic use.

AB  - PURPOSE: New treatments are currently under investigation for intrinsic sphincter insufficiency. However, animal models in which to study the resting urethral tone  generated by the striated urethral sphincter are still lacking. We describe the  striated urethral sphincter in the pig. We investigated its participation in  resting urethral tone with the aim of developing new tools for evaluating  therapies for sphincter insufficiency. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 15  female pigs were used in this study. Anatomy of the striated urethral sphincter  was described via transpubic and endoscopic approaches. Participation of the  striated urethral sphincter in resting urethral tone was assessed by analysis of  urethral pressure profilometry (maximum urethral closure pressure, functional  urethral length and area under the curve) before and after curare injection or by  destruction of the striated urethral sphincter by endoscopic electrocautery.  Serial urethral cross sections were immunostained for slow/fast myosin and  digitalized for 3-dimensional reconstructions to determine striated urethral  sphincter volume. RESULTS: The striated urethral sphincter was Omega-shaped and  it encircled the distal third of the urethra. A mean peak intraurethral pressure  +/- SEM of 58.9 +/- 13.4 cm H(2)O was noted in front of the striated urethral  sphincter. Curare injection and endoscopic injury decreased maximum urethral  closure pressure by 48.4% and 51.1%, functional urethral length by 10.3% and  15.3%, and area under the curve by 47% and 64%, respectively. The striated  urethral sphincter consisted of 52% slow and 48% fast myofibers. Its mean volume  was 0.87 cm. CONCLUSIONS: The striated urethral sphincter of the female pig shows  the morphological and functional features of a tonic muscle. Methods of measuring  resting urethral tone generated by the striated urethral sphincter represent  original tools for evaluating therapies for intrinsic sphincter insufficiency.

AB  - The objective of the present investigation was to prepare and evaluate floating granular delivery system consisting of (i) calcium silicate (CS) as porous  carrier; (ii) ranitidine hydrochloride (RH), an anti-ulcer agent; and (iii)  hydroxypropyl methylcellulose K4M (HPMC) and ethylcellulose (EC) as matrix  forming polymers. The effect of various formulation and process variables on the  particle morphology, particle size, micromeritic properties, percent drug  content, in vitro floating behavior, and in vitro drug release from the floating  granules was studied. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of granules revealed  that that more pores of CS in secondary coated granules (SCG) were covered by the  polymer film than those in primary coated granules (PCG). The formulation  demonstrated favorable in vitro floating and drug release characteristics. The in  vivo evaluation for the determination of pharmacokinetic parameters was performed  in albino rats. Higher plasma concentration was maintained throughout the study  period from the floating granules of RH. The enhanced bioavailability and  elimination half-life observed in the present study may be due to the floating  nature of the dosage form. The results suggested that CS is a useful carrier for  the development of floating and sustained release preparations.

AB  - In a porcine model of uncontrolled hemorrhagic shock, we evaluated the effects of fluid resuscitation versus arginine vasopressin (AVP) combined with  hypertonic-hyperoncotic hydroxyethyl starch solution (HHS) on cerebral perfusion  pressure (CPP) and on cerebral metabolism using intracerebral microdialysis.  Sixteen anesthetized pigs were subjected to uncontrolled liver bleeding until  hemodynamic decompensation, followed by resuscitation using either fluid (n = 8)  or AVP/HHS (n = 8). Thirty minutes after drug administration, bleeding was  controlled by manual compression, and colloid and crystalloid solutions were  administered in both groups. All surviving animals were observed for one hour.  After hemodynamic decompensation, fluid resuscitation resulted in a smaller  increase of CPP than did AVP/HHS (mean +/- sem; 24 +/- 5 vs 45 +/- 7 mm Hg; P <  0.01). Mean (+/- sem) cerebral venous partial pressure of oxygen was  significantly decreased (P < 0.01) 5 min after fluid compared with 5 min after  AVP/HHS administration (36 +/- 3 vs 64 +/- 4 torr). Cerebral metabolism was  comparable in both groups. In conclusion, AVP/HHS proved to be superior to fluid  in the initial phase of therapy with respect to CPP and cerebral oxygenation, but  was comparable to fluid regarding cerebral metabolism and secondary cell damage  in surviving animals.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The use of non-heart-beating donors (NHBD) has been advocated as an alternative to overcome the critical organ shortage in lung transplantation  despite the warm ischemic period that may result in primary graft dysfunction. On  the contrary, brain death in the heart-beating donor (HBD) may be an  underestimated risk factor for donor lung injury. We postulated that 60 min of  warm ischemia in the NHBD is less detrimental to the lung than the  pathophysiological changes after brain death in the HBD. In this study we  compared the quality of lungs from HBD versus NHBD in an isolated reperfusion  model. METHODS: Pigs (n=10 per group) were divided into three groups. In group I  (HBD), brain death was induced by acute inflation of an intracranial epidural  balloon catheter. In group II (CONTROL), the balloon was not inflated. In group  III (NHBD), cardiac arrest was induced by myocardial fibrillation. After 5 h of  in situ mechanical ventilation, lungs in HBD and CONTROL were preserved with a  cold antegrade flush. In NHBD, unflushed grafts were explanted after 1 h of warm  ischemia and 4 h of topical cooling in the cadaver. Graft performance was  evaluated during 1 h in an isolated ventilation and reperfusion model.  Extravascular lung water content (EVLW) was calculated. All data are reported as  mean+/-SEM. RESULTS: A significant autonomic storm was observed in HBD following  balloon inflation. During ex vivo assessment, pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR)  at 60 min in HBD (2634+/-371 dynes cm(-5)) was significantly higher as compared  with that of CONTROL and NHBD (1894+/-137 dynes s cm(-5) and 1268+/-111 dynes s  cm(-5), respectively; p<0.05). Plateau airway pressure (Plateau AwP) was also  higher in HBD (17+/-1cmH2O) compared with that of CONTROL (12+/-1 cmH2O; p<0.05)  and NHBD (14+/-1 cmH2O; not significant). No significant differences were  observed between HBD, CONTROL and NHBD in EVLW (79+/-1%, 79+/-0% and 78+/-1%,  respectively), and in PO2/FiO2 (564+/-58 mmHg, 622+/-14 mmHg and 578+/-26 mmHg,  respectively). CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that 1-h warm ischemic lungs in  our model are less susceptible to ischemia-reperfusion injury than lungs  retrieved 5 h after brain death. This study further supports the use of lungs  from NHBD for pulmonary transplantation.

AB  - 1. Bradykinin B(2) receptor activation confers preconditioning from ischaemic injury. In the present study, we tested whether an angiotensin-converting enzyme  (ACE) inhibitor (captopril) could mediate delayed preconditioning and, thus,  cardioprotection. 2. New Zealand white rabbits received 15 mL infusion of either  saline (control group; n = 7) or drugs (0.3 mg/kg captopril (CAP group; n = 7) or  0.3 mg/kg captopril + 0.1 mg/kg HOE 140 (CAPHOE group; n = 7)) via a marginal ear  vein over 30 min. After 24 h, hearts were connected to a Langendorff apparatus  and buffer perfused. The experimental protocol consisted of 20 min global  normothermic hypoxia, followed by 120 min reperfusion. 3. Compared with baseline,  the mean (SEM) contractile state (= dP/dt(max)) at 120 min reperfusion was  decreased to 42 +/- ;23, 72 +/- ;16 (*P < 0.05 vs control) and 49 +/- ;22% in the  control, CAP and CAPHOE groups, respectively. Early relaxation (= dP/dt(min)) was  reduced to 55 +/- ;28, 73 +/- ;15 (*P < 0.05 vs control) and 52 +/- ;19% in the  control, CAP and CAPHOE groups, respectively. The estimate for myocardial oxygen  consumption (MVO(2)= rate-pressure product) was decreased to 52 +/- ;15, 69 +/-  ;24 (*P < 0.05 vs control) and 56 +/- ;15% in the control, CAP and CAPHOE groups,  respectively. Similarly, coronary flow was decreased in the control, CAP and  CAPHOE groups to 49 +/- ;20, 67 +/- ;18 and 46 +/- ;19%, respectively. In  contrast, ventricular extrasystoles during reperfusion were significantly  elevated in both the CAP and CAPHOE groups (1.3 +/- ;0.2 and 1.1 +/- ;0.3 /min,  respectively) compared with control (0.4 +/- ;0.2 /min). 4. Captopril confers  delayed preconditioning against stunning via a B(2) receptor-mediated pathway.  This pharmacological preconditioning protects against systolic and diastolic  stunning, against vascular stunning and preserves cardiac metabolism. In addition  to its accepted cardioprotective effects in early preconditioning, captopril  should induce delayed preconditioning (e.g. for routine interventional cardiology  or in elective cardiac surgery).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Carvedilol is an alpha-and beta-blocking agent with antioxidant properties. We examined if treatment with carvedilol in vivo protected the heart  against ischemic injury ex vivo. METHODS: Isolated hearts from treated rats (80  mg/kg/day) were subjected to 30 min regional ischemia. Hearts from non-treated  animals received either no drug, 10 min carvedilol (1 microM) acute or ischemic  preconditioning (IP) by 5 min ischemia +5 min reperfusion prior to regional  ischemia. In separate experiments isolated hearts were subjected to 15 min global  ischemia and 30 min reperfusion. RESULTS: Infarct size was significantly reduced  by ischemic preconditioning or by chronic carvedilol treatment (9.0+/-0.9% and  7.2+/-1.9% of risk zone infarcted, respectively, vs. 33.8+/-6.4% in control  hearts, mean+/-SEM, p < 0.05). Recovery of left ventricular developed pressure  after global ischemia was not improved by carvedilol. Post-ischemic rise in left  ventricular end diastolic pressure was, however, attenuated by chronic carvedilol  treatment. CONCLUSION: Chronic in vivo but not acute ex vivo pretreatment with  carvedilol significantly limited infarct size in isolated rat hearts.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To test the hypothesis that remote ischaemic preconditioning (rIPC) reduces injury after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). DESIGN: Randomised study with  an experimental model of CPB (3 h CPB with 2 h of cardioplegic arrest). Twelve 15  kg pigs were randomly assigned to control or rIPC before CPB and followed up for  6 h. INTERVENTION: rIPC was induced by four 5 min cycles of lower limb ischaemia  before CPB. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Troponin I, glial protein S-100B, lactate  concentrations, load-independent indices (conductance catheter) of systolic and  diastolic function, and pulmonary resistance and compliance were measured before  and for 6 h after CPB. RESULTS: Troponin I increased after CPB in both groups but  during reperfusion the rIPC group had lower concentrations than controls (mean  area under the curve -57.3 (SEM 7.3) v 89.0 (11.6) ng.h/ml, p = 0.02). Lactate  increased after CPB in both groups but during reperfusion the control group had  significantly more prolonged hyperlactataemia (p = 0.04). S-100B did not differ  between groups. Indices of ventricular function did not differ. There was a  tendency to improved lung compliance (p = 0.07), and pulmonary resistance changed  less in the rIPC than in the control group during reperfusion (p = 0.02).  Subsequently, peak inspiratory pressure was lower (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: rIPC  significantly attenuated clinically relevant markers of myocardial and pulmonary  injury after CPB. Transient limb ischaemia as an rIPC stimulus has potentially  important clinical applications.

AB  - PURPOSE: We investigated the neurotrophic effect of FK1706 on erectile recovery following bilateral cavernous nerve crush injury in a rat model. MATERIALS AND  METHODS: A total of 28 male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 4  equal groups. Seven animals underwent sham operation and subcutaneous vehicle  injection, whereas 21 underwent bilateral cavernous nerve crush injury followed  by vehicle injection alone, or by low (0.1 mg/kg) or high (1.0 mg/kg) dose FK1706  treatment. Injections were continued 5 days weekly for 8 weeks. Erectile function  was then assessed by cavernous nerve electrostimulation and penile tissue was  evaluated immunohistochemically. RESULTS: No erectile dysfunction was identified  in the sham treated group (mean maximal intracavernous pressure +/- SEM 106.8 +/-  6.4 cm H(2)O), whereas nerve injury significantly decreased ICP to 17.9 +/- 7.0  cm H(2)O. FK1706 facilitated neural and erectile recovery in a concentration  dependent manner with a mean ICP in the high dose FK treatment group of 80.1 +/-  7.8 cm H(2)O compared with 44.1 +/- 12.9 cm H(2)O in the low dose group. Similar  stepwise findings were observed using mean area under the curve data. Sham  treated animals showed regular axon sizes and shapes with homogenous GAP-43 and  neurofilament staining, whereas injured axons showed irregular shapes, sizes and  staining patterns. FK1706 treatment restored axon shape and staining patterns.  Injury significantly decreased nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate  staining and FK1706 treatment showed a nonsignificant trend toward increased  staining. CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral cavernous nerve crush causes reproducible  erectile dysfunction, consistent with prior experiments. High dose subcutaneous  FK1706 therapy promotes significant neuroregeneration and erectile function  recovery.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the intracavernosal application of growth differentiation factor-5 (GDF-5) influences nerve regeneration and erectile  function after cavernosal nerve injury in a rat model. MATERIALS AND METHODS:  Thirty-two male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four equal groups:  eight had a sham operation (uninjured controls), while 24 had bilateral  cavernosal nerve crush. The crush-injury groups were treated at the time of  injury with an impregnated collagen sponge implanted into the right corpus  cavernosum. The sponge contained no GDF-5 (injured controls), 2 microg (low  concentration), or 20 microg GDF-5 (high concentration). Erectile function was  assessed by cavernosal nerve electrostimulation at 8 weeks. Midshaft penile  tissue samples were histochemically evaluated for neuronal nitric oxide synthase  (nNOS)-containing fibres in the dorsal penile nerve. RESULTS: There was no  erectile dysfunction in the uninjured control group, as shown by a mean (sem)  maximal increase in intracavernosal pressure (ICP) of 149.5 (17.0) cmH(2)O on  stimulation. By comparison, the ICP decreased in the injured control group, by  21.3 (6.7) cmH(2)O. After cavernosal nerve injury, the recovery of erectile  function was greatest in the low-concentration GDF-5 group; the maximum ICP  increase was 40.8 (13.3) cmH(2)O, vs 24.3 (5.9) cmH(2)O for 20 microg GDF-5.  Histologically, the low-concentration group had significantly more  nNOS-containing nerve fibres, at 163 (24.7), than the high-concentration group,  at 76 (17.3), or injured controls, at 67 (23.8). By contrast, the uninjured  controls had a mean of 538 (40.6) nerve fibres in the dorsal nerve. CONCLUSION:  Bilateral cavernosal nerve crush resulted in erectile dysfunction with  accompanying neurological changes in the rat. The intracavernosal application of  GDF-5 enhanced the recovery of erectile function and n-NOS nerve preservation,  with a 2-microg dose giving the most promising results.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that complement inhibition reduces reperfusion injury. A clinical setting with local application of a C1 esterase inhibitor  (C1-INH) has been modeled in an animal study in order to further investigate  these findings. METHODS: In 21 pigs, the left anterior descending coronary artery  (LAD) was occluded distally to the first diagonal branch for 2 hours (h),  including 1 h of cardioplegic arrest during CPB. After release of the coronary  snare, C1-INH or NaCl (control) was applied to the aortic root. Thereafter, the  aortic cross-clamp was removed and the heart was reperfused for 30 minutes before  weaning from CPB. Left ventricular pressure volume analysis was performed by a  multielectrode conductance catheter and the area at risk and infarct size were  determined from excised hearts. RESULTS: The following data were observed  (mean+/-SEM) for the control group and the C1-INH group, respectively, after 1-h  ligation of the LAD: heart rate (HR) 86+/-3 and 93+/-6 beats/min, stroke volume  (SV) 1.2+/-0.1 and 1.2+/-0.1 ml/kg, aortic pressure (AoP) 83+/-6 and 87+/-5 mmHg,  left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVedP) 12+/-1 and 11+/-2 mmHg; two hours  after weaning from CPB: HR 106+/-9 and 123+/-4 beats/min, SV 0.9+/-0.1 and  0.9+/-0.1 ml/kg, AoP 65+/-5 and 79+/-7 mmHg, LVedP 9+/-1 and 8+/-1 mmHg.  Conductance catheter measurements showed no improved left ventricular performance  after C1-INH application. Infarct size to area at risk ratio was 61.5+/-4.2% for  controls and 61.4+/-4.8% for C1-INH. CONCLUSIONS: Intracoronary application of  complement inhibitor in an acute infarction model, which mimicked a clinical  setting of urgent coronary bypass grafting after ischemia, has been shown to  neither influence the area of infarction, nor the ventricular function.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The value of early therapy with beta-blocking agents in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) undergoing reperfusion is not yet well established.  Newer beta-blocking agents such as carvedilol offer potential advantages in the  setting of ischemia and reperfusion injury. METHODS: We randomized 100 patients  with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) to receive either 12.5 mg  carvedilol or 50 mg metoprolol tartrate orally already before percutaneous  coronary intervention (PCI) of the infarct-related artery, uptitrating to a daily  target dose of 50 mg carvedilol or 150 mg metoprolol during the first week. Pts.  were subjected to left ventricular (LV) angiography just before reperfusion and  after 14 days to compare ejection fraction (EF) and regional wall motion  abnormalities by quantitative LV analysis. Furthermore, kinetics of cardiac  troponin T (cTnT), NT-proANP, NT-proBNP, endothelin, argenine vasopressin,  epinephrine and norepinephrine were assessed during the first 12 hours and again  at 2 weeks. In addition, reperfusion-induced rhythm abnormalities like VT,  triplets, couplets, and bradycardic events were assessed continuously during the  first 12 hours starting at reperfusion by Holter analysis. RESULTS: Both groups  did not differ with respect to onset of pain, target vessel, extent of coronary  heart disease, age, gender, rate of stenting or use of a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor,  pre- and postinterventional TIMI flow grade, time course of heart rate or blood  pressure. There were neither significant differences in the cardiac and  neurohumoral markers nor in the occurrence of arrhythmias between both treatment  groups. Within 14 days, EF improved by 5.8+/-2.0% (mean+/-SEM) in the metoprolol  group and by 5.2+/-2.1% in the carvedilol group (n.s.). Area of infarction was  reduced by 6.1+/-2.9% in the metoprolol group and by 12.8+/-3.6% of total LV  outline in the carvedilol group (n.s.). Maximum hypokinesia in the central  infarcted region was diminished by 0.40+/-0.11 standard deviation (SD) in the  metoprolol group and by 0.34+/-0.13 SD in the carvedilol group (n.s.).  CONCLUSION: In the setting of direct PCI in acute STEMI, administration of  carvedilol before reperfusion appears not to be superior to metoprolol with  respect to myocardial injury and improvement of global and regional LV function.  The study documents equivalent improvement of LV function and similar kinetics of  cardiac and neurohumoral markers in pts. with acute STEMI undergoing direct PCI  if the pts. were immediately treated with either carvedilol or metoprolol. Thus,  superiority of carvedilol in experimental studies did not translate into a  clinical benefit.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Postconditioning, a series of brief ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) cycles at reperfusion onset, is a recently described novel approach to attenuate I/R  injury, and because it is an after-injury treatment strategy, it may have greater  clinical potential than preconditioning. However, it has not been determined  whether postconditioning is effective in women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adult male  and female (250-300 g) Sprague-Dawley rat hearts (n = 25) were isolated, perfused  via Langendorff model, and subjected to 15 min of equilibration, 20 or 25 min of  global index ischemia (37 degrees C), and 40 min total reperfusion.  Postconditioned hearts were subjected to 6 cycles of 10-s reperfusion/10-s  ischemia immediately after release of the global index ischemia. Hearts were  assigned randomly to one of four groups: 1) control hearts, 20 min index  ischemia; 2) postconditioned hearts, 20 min index ischemia; 3) control hearts, 25  min index ischemia; or 4) postconditioned hearts, 25 min index ischemia. All data  are reported as mean +/- SEM and were analyzed with unpaired student's t test; P  < 0.05 considered significant. RESULTS: Postconditioning in female rats after 20  min of ischemia reduced depression of left ventricular-developed pressure (93.9  +/- 6.7% postconditioning recovery versus 58.6 +/- 12.6% control recovery, P <  0.05), attenuated the increase of end-diastolic pressure (P < 0.05), and reduced  the depression of +dP/dT and -dP/dT (P < 0.05). The postconditioning protective  effect disappeared in female rats exposed to 25 min of ischemia. The  postconditioning protective effect was observed in male rats after both 20 min  and 25 min ischemia. CONCLUSIONS: Postconditioning confers cardioprotection in  leukocyte-free, buffer-perfused female hearts, but this protection may depend on  ischemia duration. The attractive potential for the clinical application of  postconditioning, however, warrants further studies to elucidate the mechanistic  pathways and differences in males and female rats.

AB  - Patients with spinal cord injury have an increased risk of developing respiratory tract infections as the result of expiratory muscle paralysis and consequent  inability to cough. We have developed a method by which the expiratory muscles  can be activated via lower thoracic and upper lumbar spinal cord stimulation to  produce an effective cough mechanism. In a tetraplegic patient who required  frequent (8.57+/-2.3 times per week [mean+/-SEM]) caregiver assistance to  facilitate airway clearance and expectoration of secretions, three epidural  electrodes were applied in the T9, T11, and L1 spinal cord regions. During  stimulation at the T9 and L1 levels, airway pressures were 90 and 82 cm H2O,  respectively. Peak expiratory flow rates were 6.4 L/s and 5.0 L/s; respectively.  During combined (T9+L1) stimulation, airway pressure and expiratory flow rate  increased to 132 cm H2O and 7.4 L/s, respectively. Addition of the third lead did  not result in further increases in pressure generation. These values are  characteristic of those observed with a normal subject. Because the patient is  able to trigger the device independently, he no longer requires caregiver support  for airway management. If confirmed in additional patients, spinal cord  stimulation may be a useful method to restore an effective cough mechanism in  patients with spinal cord injury.

AB  - Pantoprazole is an important drug in the treatment of acid-related disorders. This work concerns the preparation and characterization of gastro-resistant  pantoprazole-loaded microparticles prepared using an O/O emulsification/solvent  evaporation technique. The in vivo activity of the pantoprazole-loaded Eudragit  S100 microparticles was carried out in rats. Furthermore, tablets containing the  microparticles were also investigated. Microparticles presented spherical and  smooth morphologies (SEM) and they remained intact in the inner surface of  tablets. DSC and IR analyses showed that pantoprazole was physically and  molecularly dispersed in the polymer. In vivo anti-ulcer evaluation showed that  the microparticles were able to protect rat stomachs against ulcer formation,  while the drug aqueous solution did not present activity. Drug dissolution  profiles from tablets demonstrated slower release than untabletted  microparticles. Weibull equation was the best model for describing the drug  release profiles from microparticles and tablets. As regards the acid protection,  tablets showed a satisfactory drug protection in acid medium (61.05 +/- 8.09%  after 30 min).

AB  - cGMP and opening of mitochondrial K(ATP) channel play an important role in preconditioning of the heart following ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. We  investigated the cardioprotective effect of vardenafil (VAR) (Levitra), a highly  selective and biochemically potent inhibitor of phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) that  enhances erectile function in men through up-regulation of cGMP. Rabbits were  treated with VAR (0.014 mg/kg, iv) or volume-matched saline, 30 min prior to 30  min of sustained regional ischemia followed by 3 h of reperfusion.  5-hydroxydecanoate (5-HD, 5 mg/kg, iv) or HMR 1098 (HMR, 3 mg/kg, iv), the  respective blockers of mitochondrial or sarcolemmal K(ATP) channels were  administered 10 min before I/R. Infarct size was measured by computer morphometry  of tetrazolium stained sections. Vardenafil treatment caused decrease in mean  arterial blood pressure from 93.5+/-2.6 to 82.2+/-1.5 mmHg and increase in heart  rate from baseline value of 151+/-20 to 196+/-4.6 bpm (mean+/-standard error of  mean (S.E.M.), P<0.05) within 5 min. The infarct size (% of risk area) was  reduced from 33.8+/-1.3 in control rabbits to 14.3+/-2.2 (58% reduction, P<0.05).  5-HD abolished VAR-induced protection as demonstrated by increase in infarct size  to 34.5+/-2.3 (P<0.05, N=6 per group). In contrast, HMR failed to block the  protective effect of VAR (infarct size, 14.3+/-2.2 versus 16.3+/-1.0 in VAR +  HMR, P>0.05). Neither inhibitors of the K(ATP) channel influenced the infarct  size in the control rabbits, as shown by infarct size of 34.9+/-1.1 and  33.3+/-1.4 in animals treated with 5-HD and HMR, respectively. For the first  time, we demonstrate that VAR induces protective effect against I/R injury via  opening of mitochondrial K(ATP) channel. These results further support our  hypothesis that the novel class of PDE-5 inhibitors induce protective effect in  the ischemic heart, in addition to their well known clinical effects in the  treatment of erectile dysfunction in men.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Endothelins (ET) can be considered stress-responsive regulators working in paracrine and autocrine fashion. It has been suggested that elevated  levels of ET may be responsible for the low coronary re-flow phenomena.  Ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) was shown to stimulate ET release in rat heart;  however, the mechanism(s) of this effect has not been clarified. Therefore, this  study was focused to investigate the effect of BQ-123, selective ETA receptor  antagonist, on three aspects of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (MI/R) injury:  hemodynamic parameters, infarct size and oxidant-antioxidant status in the  absence and presence of ET-1 in an vivo rat model. METHODS AND RESULTS: To  produce MI/R, a branch of the descending left coronary artery was occluded for 30  min followed by 2h reperfusion. ECG changes, blood pressure (BP), and heart rate  (HR) were measured before occlusion and continued both occlusion and reperfusion.  Forty rats were randomly assigned to five groups equally: (1) sham-operated rats  without coronary ligation, (2) I/R group, (3) I/R+BQ-123-treated group (10  microg/kg/min i.v.), (4) I/R+ET-treated group (25 ng/kg/min i.v.), (5)  I/R+ET+BQ-123-treated group. The results are expressed as mean+/-S.E.M. In the  ET-1 plus I/R group, the ratio between the infarcted area and area at risk  56+/-1% was significantly higher than I/R group (49+/-1%). In the BQ-123 group  with or without exogenous ET-1 treatment in I/R group, this ratio was  significantly lower at 40+/-2 and 37+/-1%, respectively. As compared to sham  group, I/R increased lipid peroxidation whereas decreased nitric oxide (NO),  glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) contents. This  decreased antioxidant enzymatic defense could result in aggravated oxidative  damage in I/R group rat hearts. ET-1 administration group showed severe oxidative  damage. BQ-123 administrations to I/R group with or without ET-1 caused  significantly decrease in lipid peroxidation and increased in SOD, CAT activities  and NO generation and GSH content when compared with I/R group alone.  CONCLUSIONS: The most important finding of the present study is that the ET  blockade reduced I/R-induced myocardial injury. The mechanism of this reduction  was speculated to be a resistance to ischemic injury in the subcellular levels of  the myocardium conferred by a reduction of vascular constriction and improvement  of imbalance in the antioxidant status.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aims of this study were to describe the early time course of hemodynamic and tissue perfusion and oxygenation patterns in survivors and  nonsurvivors after head injury; to suggest physiologic mechanisms responsible for  the observed patterns; and to evaluate postinjury parameters that might be useful  for treatment. The hypothesis was that reduced hemodynamics and tissue  oxygenation and reduced arterial oxygen saturation affect outcomes. STUDY DESIGN:  Sixty patients with head trauma were noninvasively monitored on arrival in the  emergency department to assess the temporal hemodynamic patterns associated with  head injury; patients who were brain dead were excluded because they have very  different hemodynamic patterns. Cardiac index, mean arterial pressure, and heart  rate were monitored to assess cardiac function, pulse oximetry to reflect changes  in pulmonary function, and transcutaneous oxygen and carbon dioxide to reflect  tissue perfusion function. Patients were stratified by inhospital survival  outcomes, the Glasgow Coma Scale, and the presence or absence of associated  somatic injuries. RESULTS: When all head injured patients were considered  together, the predominant findings were high cardiac index, hypertension, mild  tachycardia, normal pulmonary function, and reduced tissue oxygenation. The  subset of survivors and those with high Glasgow Coma Scale had greater than  normal cardiac index responses (4.02 +/- 0.01 (SEM) L/min/m2, p < 0.01 versus  normal) and better tissue oxygenation (217 +/- 2 mmHg PtcO2/FiO2) than  nonsurvivors (70 +/- 3 mmHg, p < 0.01) and those with low Glasgow Coma Scale (160  +/- 2, p < 0.05). Patterns of patients with associated somatic injuries were  similar to those with isolated head injury. CONCLUSIONS: The study suggested that  survivors' cardiac index, tissue oxygenation, and arterial oxygen saturation may  be considered as markers of resuscitation. Nonsurvivors of head injury had normal  blood flow with reduced tissue oxygenation that might have contributed to  unfavorable outcomes.

T2  - European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Previously, we showed intermittent cross-clamp fibrillation afforded equivalent protection to cardioplegia. This study examined whether protection  induced by intermittent cross-clamp fibrillation involves an ischemic  preconditioning mechanism. METHODS: Isolated Langendorff-perfused rat hearts were  subjected to three different studies to determine: Study 1, whether a single  intermittent cross-clamp fibrillation episode (10 min) and reperfusion (10 min)  before prolonged ischemia acts as a preconditioning trigger for protection; Study  2, whether cardioprotection induced by intermittent cross-clamp fibrillation  alone (no prolonged ischemia) involves a preconditioning mechanism; Study 3,  whether intermittent cross-clamp fibrillation cardioprotection can be prevented  by targeting putative components of the preconditioning mechanism (protein kinase  C or the mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channel). Hearts were  reperfused (60 min) and recovery of function (left ventricular developed pressure  measured using an intraventricular balloon) and myocardial injury (creatine  kinase leakage) were measured. RESULTS: In Study 1, recovery of function in the  single intermittent cross-clamp fibrillation hearts was 61+/-3% (mean+/-SEM)  (p<0.05) compared to 41+/-2% in control group; glibenclamide (a non-specific  ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP))-channel blocker) prevented this preconditioning  protection (37+/-4%). In Study 2, recovery of function in intermittent  cross-clamp fibrillation hearts (62+/-3%) was significantly (p<0.05) higher than  intermittent cross-clamp fibrillation hearts treated with glibenclamide (33+/-2%)  and ischemia hearts (30+/-5%). In Study 3, protection by intermittent cross-clamp  fibrillation (60+/-3%; p<0.05) was attenuated by protein kinase C inhibition  (chelerythrine, 34+/-3%) and mitochondrial K(ATP)-channel blockade  (5-hydroxydecanoate, 27+/-4%) to levels not significantly different from that of  ischemia hearts (25+/-4%). CONCLUSIONS: The cardioprotective efficacy of  intermittent cross-clamp fibrillation was attenuated by protein kinase C  inhibition or K(ATP)-channel blockade. Involvement of these putative  preconditioning cascade components in association with cardioprotection induced  by intermittent cross-clamp fibrillation, suggests a role for the ischemic  preconditioning mechanism.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is an independent risk factor for higher morbidity and mortality rates from trauma. We tested the null hypothesis that  there would be no difference in the hemorrhage volumes and hemodynamic responses  to uncontrolled hemorrhage between Zucker Diabetic Fat rats (ZDF) and euglycemic  Sprague-Dawley rats (SD). METHODS: Twenty-four adult male rats (12 ZDF and 12 SD)  were anesthetized with althesin via the intraperitoneal route. The femoral artery  was cannulated by cut-down to monitor the heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure  (MAP) and to obtain blood samples for blood gas analysis. Twelve rats (6 ZDF and  6 SD) underwent uncontrolled hemorrhage by 50% tail amputation. Twelve rats (6  ZDF and 6 SD) served as non-hemorrhage controls. The HR, MAP, lactate (LAC),  glucose levels (GL) and cumulative hemorrhage volume (CHV) were measured  pre-hemorrhage and then every 15 min post-hemorrhage for 120 min. Data were  reported as mean+/-S.E.M. Group comparisons were analyzed by ANOVA with repeated  values; post hoc testing by Bonferroni (all tests were two-tailed, alpha = 0.05).  RESULTS: Pre-hemorrhage the SD and ZDF were evenly matched for LAC, HR and MAP.  CHV (cm3/100 g) was significantly (p = 0.008) greater in the ZDF (1.49+/-0.12) as  compared to the SD (0.38+/-0.11). The ZDF had significantly (p < 0.001) higher  LAC (7.96+/-0.61 mmol/L) than the SD (2.0+/-0.41 mmol/L). CONCLUSION: DM as  compared to non-DM rats suffered a greater blood loss with a more severe lactic  acidosis after a comparable uncontrolled vascular injury.

AB  - The aims were to apply a stochastic model to predict outcome early in acute emergencies and to evaluate the effectiveness of various therapies in a  consecutively monitored series of severely injured patients with noninvasive  hemodynamic monitoring. The survival probabilities were calculated beginning  shortly after admission to the emergency department (ED) and at subsequent  intervals during their hospitalization. Cardiac function was evaluated by cardiac  output (CI), heart rate (HR), and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), pulmonary  function by pulse oximetry (SapO(2)), and tissue perfusion function by  transcutaneous oxygen indexed to FiO(2),(PtcO(2)/FiO(2)), and carbon dioxide  (PtcCO(2)) tension. The survival probability (SP) of survivors averaged  81.5+/-1.1% (SEM) and for nonsurvivors 57.7+/-2.3% (p<0.001) in the first 24-hour  period of resuscitation and subsequent management. The CI, SapO(2),PtcO(2)/FiO(2)  and MAP were significantly higher in survivors than in nonsurvivors during the  initial resuscitation, while HR and PtcCO(2) tensions were higher in the  nonsurvivors. Predictions made during the initial resuscitation period in the  first 24-hours after admission were compared with the actual outcome at hospital  discharge, which were usually several weeks later; misclassifications were 9.6%  (16/167). The therapeutic decision support system objectively evaluated the  responses of alternative therapies based on responses of patients with similar  clinical-hemodynamic states.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Post-resuscitation gut edema and associated gut dysfunction is a common and significant clinical problem that occurs after traumatic injury and  shock. We have shown previously that gut edema without ischemia/reperfusion  injury delays intestinal transit [1]. We hypothesized that gut edema increases  expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) protein, and that selective  iNOS inhibition using L-NIL reverses the delayed intestinal transit associated  with gut edema. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hour prior to laparotomy, rats were  pretreated with 10 mg/kg body weight of intraperitoneal L-NIL or saline vehicle  and underwent 80 ml/kg body weight of 0.9% saline + superior mesenteric venous  pressure elevation (Edema) or sham surgery (Sham). A duodenal catheter was placed  to allow injection of a fluorescent dye for the measurement of intestinal  transit. At 6 h, the small bowel was divided and the mean geometric center (MGC)  of fluorescent dye was measured to determine transit. Ileum was harvested for  histological assessment of mucosal injury, evaluation of iNOS protein expression  by Western blotting, and MPO activity. Tissue water was determined using the  wet-to-dry weight ratio to assess gut edema. Data are expressed as mean +/- SEM,  n = 3-6 and * = P <0.05 using ANOVA. RESULTS: Gut edema, expressed as increased  wet-to-dry ratio, was associated with decreased intestinal transit and elevated  iNOS protein expression. Pretreatment with l-NIL improved intestinal transit and  decreased expression of iNOS protein without decreasing intestinal tissue water  compared to edema animals. There was no difference in mucosal injury or MPO  activity among groups. CONCLUSION: Gut edema delays intestinal transit via an  iNOS-mediated mechanism.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We demonstrated previously that treatment with selective kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) agonist BRL 52537 hydrochloride  [(+/-)-1-(3,4-dichlorophenyl) acetyl-2-(1-pyrrolidinyl) methylpiperidine] (1) has  a long therapeutic window for providing ischemic neuroprotection, and (2)  attenuates ischemia-evoked NO production in vivo in rats. Neuronally derived NO  has been shown to be deleterious in the male but not in the female rodent model  of focal ischemic stroke. We tested the hypothesis that BRL provides significant  neuroprotection from transient focal ischemia in male but not in female rats.  METHODS: Halothane-anesthetized adult male and female Wistar rats (250 to 275 g)  were subjected to 2 hours of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) by the  intraluminal suture technique. Adequacy of MCAO and reperfusion was monitored  with laser-Doppler flowmetry over the ipsilateral parietal cortex. In the first  experiment, male and female rats were treated in a blinded randomized fashion  with vehicle saline or 1 mg/kg per hour BRL infusion started at the onset of  reperfusion and continued for 22 hours. In the second experiment, ovariectomized  (OVX) female rats were treated with vehicle or BRL. Infarct volume in the cortex  and caudoputamen (CP) complex was assessed by triphenyl tetrazolium chloride  staining at 72 hours after MCAO. RESULTS: Infarct volume (percentage of  ipsilateral structure; mean+/-SEM) was attenuated significantly in male rats with  BRL treatment (cortex 23+/-5%; CP 44+/-6%; n=15) compared with vehicle-treated  male rats (cortex 38+/-4%; CP 66+/-4%; n=15) but not in female rats (BRL-cortex  26+/-6; CP 55+/-8%; vehicle-cortex 26+/-5; CP 62+/-5%; n=10 each). Neurologic  deficit score was improved in BRL-treated male rats but not in female rats.  Infarct volume was not different in OVX female rats treated with vehicle or BRL.  CONCLUSIONS: These data: (1) demonstrate that this dose of selective KOR agonist  provides ischemic neuroprotection in male but not female rats, (2) demonstrate  that the lack of protection by BRL is not attributable to circulating ovarian  hormones, and (3) highlight the importance of using animal models of both sexes  in preclinical studies of experimental ischemia.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to review our experience with interfacility transfers to identify problems that could be addressed in the  development of a statewide trauma system. BACKGROUND: The fundamental tenet of a  trauma system is to get the right patient to the right hospital at the right  time. This hinges on well-defined prehospital destination criteria, interfacility  transfer protocols, and education of caregivers. Patients arriving at local  community hospitals (LOCs) benefit from stabilization and transfer to trauma  centers (TCs) for definitive care. However, in the absence of a formalized trauma  system, patients may not reach the TC in a timely fashion and may not be  appropriately treated or stabilized at LOCs prior to transfer. METHODS: Our  facility is a level I TC and regional referral center for a compact geographic  area without a formal trauma system. The Trauma Registry was queried for adult  patients admitted to the trauma service between January 1, 2001 and March 30,  2003. Patients were divided into 2 groups: those received directly from the scene  (DIR) and those transferred from another institution (TRAN). Medical records were  reviewed to elucidate details of the early care. Data are presented as mean +/-  SEM. Continuous data were compared using Student t test, and categorical data  using chi2. Transfer times were analyzed by one-way ANOVA. RESULTS: A total of  3507 patients were analyzed. The TRAN group had a higher Injury Severity Score  (ISS) (17.5 versus 11.0, P < 0.05), lower Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) (13.3 versus  14.1, P < 0.05), lower initial systolic blood pressure (SBP) (130 versus 140, P<  0.05), and higher mortality (10% versus 79%, P < 0.05) than the DIR group. The  average time spent at the LOC was 162 +/- 8 minutes. The subgroup of patients  with hypotension spent an average of 134 minutes at the LOC, often receiving  numerous diagnostic tests despite unavailability of surgeons to provide  definitive care. Severe head injury (GCS = 3) triggered more prompt transfer, but  high ISS was underappreciated and did not result in a prompt transfer in all but  the most severely injured group (ISS > 40). Some therapeutic interventions were  initiated at the LOCs, but many were required at the TC. A total of 23 (8%) TRAN  patients required critical interventions within 15 minutes of arrival; mortality  in this group was 52%. Mortality among those requiring laparotomy after transfer  was 33%. CONCLUSIONS: All but the most severely injured patients spend prolonged  periods of time in LOCs, and many require critical interventions upon arrival at  the TC. It is unreasonable to expect immediate availability of surgeons or  operating rooms in LOCs. Thus, trauma system planning efforts should focus on 1)  prehospital destination protocols that allow direct transport to the TC; and 2)  education of caregivers in LOCs to enhance intervention skill sets and expedite  transfer to definitive care.

T2  - Pain
AB  - Chronic pain following whiplash injury and non-specific arm pain (NSAP, previously termed diffuse repetitive strain injury) present clinicians with  problems of diagnosis and management. In both patient groups there are clinical  signs of altered nerve movement and increased nerve trunk mechanosensitivity.  Previous studies of NSAP patients have identified altered median nerve movement  at the wrist. The present study uses high frequency ultrasound imaging to examine  changes to median nerve movement and clinical examination to assess altered  mechanosensitivity of the median nerve. Longitudinal median nerve movement was  measured in the forearm during maximal inspiration in nine post-whiplash patients  with chronic neck and arm pain and eight controls subjects. Eight NSAP patients  and seven controls were also studied. Transverse median nerve movement at the  proximal carpal tunnel during 30 degrees wrist extension to 30 degrees flexion  was also measured. A clinical examination of nerve trunk allodynia was performed  in all subjects. Longitudinal nerve movement in the forearm was reduced by 71% in  the post-whiplash patients and by 68% in NSAP patients compared to controls. In  the whiplash patients the pattern of transverse median nerve movement at the  proximal carpal tunnel was significantly different to controls (patient  mean=2.57+/-0.80 mm (SEM) in a radial direction; control mean=0.39+/-0.52 mm in  an ulnar direction). Signs of neural mechanosensitivity (i.e. painful responses  to median nerve trunk and brachial plexus pressure and stretch) were apparent in  both patients groups. Change in nerve tension and neural mechanosensitivity may  contribute to symptoms in whiplash and NSAP patients.

AB  - We studied the effects of the inhaled endothelin-A receptor antagonist LU-135252 at different doses on hemodynamics and gas exchange in an animal model of acute  lung injury. Thirtysix piglets (27 +/- 1 kg) were anesthetized, mechanically  ventilated (FiO2 1.0), and surfactant-depleted by repeated lung lavage. The  animals were randomly assigned to receive either nebulized LU- 135252 for 30  minutes at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg (n = 12), or at a dose of 3.0 mg/kg (n = 12); n =  12 animals received no further treatment (Controls). Induction of acute lung  injury decreased PaO2 from 566 +/- 8 mmHg to 53 +/- 2 mmHg (mean +/- SEM) and  increased intrapulmonary shunt (QS/QT) from 13 +/- 1% to 57 +/- 2%. Inhalation of  LU-135252 at either dose induced a significant and sustained increase in PaO2  (0.3 mg/kg: 349 +/- 39 mmHg; 3.0 mg/kg: 219 +/- 40 mmHg), and a significant  decrease in QS/QT (0.3 mg/kg: 19 +/- 2%; 3.0 mg/kg: 27 +/- 3%) when compared with  Controls (PaO2: 50 +/- 3 mmHg, QS/QT: 50 +/- 5%) (P < 0.05; values at 4 hours).  Mean pulmonary artery pressure in LU-135252-treated animals (0.3 mg/kg: 31 +/- 2  mmHg; 3.0 mg/kg: 30 +/- 1 mmHg) was significantly lower than in Controls (40 +/-  2 mmHg), while there were no differences in mean arterial pressure and cardiac  output. We conclude that inhalation of LU-135252 at either dose improved gas  exchange and hemodynamics comparably, indicating that the lower dose was already  sufficient to block the majority of endothelin-A receptors in ventilated regions  of the injured lung.

AB  - Previous in vivo studies have demonstrated that microvessel hemorrhages and alterations of endothelial permeability can be produced in tissues containing  microbubble-based ultrasound contrast agents when those tissues are exposed to  MHz-frequency pulsed ultrasound of sufficient pressure amplitudes. The general  hypothesis guiding this research was that acoustic (viz., inertial) cavitation,  rather than thermal insult, is the dominant mechanism by which such effects  arise. We report the results of testing five specific hypotheses in an in vivo  rabbit auricular blood vessel model: (1) acoustic cavitation nucleated by  microbubble contrast agent can damage the endothelia of veins at relatively low  spatial-peak temporal-average intensities, (2) such damage will be proportional  to the peak negative pressure amplitude of the insonifying pulses, (3) damage  will be confined largely to the intimal surface, with sparing of perivascular  tissues, (4) greater damage will occur to the endothelial cells on the side of  the vessel distal to the source transducer than on the proximal side and (5)  ultrasound/contrast agent-induced endothelial damage can be inherently  thrombogenic, or can aid sclerotherapeutic thrombogenesis through the application  of otherwise subtherapeutic doses of thrombogenic drugs. Auricular vessels were  exposed to 1-MHz focused ultrasound of variable peak pressure amplitude using low  duty factor, fixed pulse parameters, with or without infusion of a shelled  microbubble contrast agent. Extravasation of Evans blue dye and erythrocytes was  assessed at the macroscopic level. Endothelial damage was assessed via scanning  electron microscopy (SEM) image analysis. The hypotheses were supported by the  data. We discuss potential therapeutic applications of vessel occlusion, e.g.,  occlusion of at-risk gastric varices.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The management of patients with hemodynamic instability related to pelvic fracture is a major challenge, with high morbidity and mortality.  Evidence-based institutional practice guidelines (PG) were developed as a  strategy to optimize the care of these patients. The aims of this study were to  evaluate the adherence to the new PG and compare the outcomes before and after  their implementation. METHODS: Major blunt trauma patients (Injury Severity Score  [ISS] > 15) with hemodynamic instability (initial base deficit > 6 mEq/L or  received > 6 units of packed red blood cells [PRBCs] during the first 12 hours)  related to pelvic fracture were investigated. Patients presenting with ongoing  bleeding from other regions or with severe head injury (Glasgow Coma Scale score  < 9) were excluded. The pre-PG group (n = 17) were patients managed during the 18  months ending on December 31, 2001. The post-PG group (n = 14) consisted of  patients managed during the subsequent 18 months. Demographics, ISS, shock  severity, resuscitation, and outcome data were prospectively collected. The  adherence to the key steps of PG was evaluated retrospectively in the pre-PG and  prospectively in the post-PG group, including abdominal clearance (AC) with  diagnostic peritoneal aspiration/lavage or ultrasound (<15 minutes), noninvasive  pelvic binding (PB) (<15 minutes), pelvic angiography (PA) (<90 minutes after  admission), and minimally invasive orthopedic fixation (MIOF) (<24 hours). Data  are presented as mean +/- SEM or percentages. RESULTS: The pre-PG and post-PG  groups were similar regarding age (40 +/- 4 years vs. 42 +/- 6 years), gender  (both 71% male), ISS (39 +/- 3 vs. 37 +/- 4), admission base deficit (9 +/- 1 vs.  10 +/- 1) admission systolic blood pressure (116 +/- 7 vs. 112 +/- 6 mm Hg),  Glasgow Coma Scale score (12 +/- 1 vs. 12 +/- 1), and PRBC transfusion in the  first 12 hours (9 +/- 2 U vs. 9 +/- 2 U). The adherence to the guidelines in the  post-PG period was as follows: AC, 100%; PB, 86% (p < 0.05 based on t test or chi  test); PA, 93% (p < 0.05 based on t test or chi test); and MIOF, 86%. In the  pre-PG period, adherence to the guidelines was as follows: AC, 65%; PB, 0%; PA,  30%; and MIOF 52%. In the post-PG period, the 24-hour PRBC transfusion decreased  from 16 +/- 2 U to 11 +/- 1 U and the mortality decreased from 35% to 7% (p <  0.05 based on t test or chi test for both). CONCLUSION: The adherence to the PG  as a reflection of optimal management was significantly improved. PG focusing  particular on timely hemorrhage control reduced the 24-hour transfusion  requirements and the mortality rate in the post-PG group.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Malnutrition is prevalent in elders with pressure ulcers and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. This study compared  nutritional status, assessed by the Mini Nutrition Assessment (MNA), to immune  function in nursing home elders with pressure ulcers. METHODS: Nutritional status  was assessed in nursing home residents (>65 years) with a stage II or more severe  pressure ulcer. Subjects were classified as well nourished, at risk of  malnutrition, or malnourished according to MNA score. Blood was drawn to assess  whole blood mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation and neutrophil respiratory  burst. Delayed-type hypersensitivity to 3 antigens was measured. MNA status was  compared with immune parameters using the Kruskall-Wallis test. RESULTS: Of the  24 subjects (23 men, 1 woman) who completed the study protocol, only 4 (17%) were  classified as well nourished, whereas 7 (29%) were at risk and 13 (54%) were  malnourished according to MNA score. Whole blood lymphocyte proliferation was  significantly lower in the malnourished vs at risk subjects with both pokeweed  (median [25th, 75th percentile], 0.6 [0.3, 0.9] vs 1.8 [1.2, 2.1] disintegrations  per minute [dpm]/cell, p < .05); and concanavalin A (1.7 [0.9, 2.0] vs 2.8 [2.6,  3.9] dpm/cell, p < .05) mitogens. Neutrophil respiratory burst normalized to a  young control was significantly lower in malnourished subjects vs well-nourished  subjects (0.8 [0.5, 0.9] vs 1.4 [1.0, 1.7], p < .05). Total induration to 3  skin-test antigens was 13.4 +/- 4.6, 3.5 +/- 2.6, and 3.8 +/- 1.8 (mean +/- SEM)  for well-nourished, at risk, and malnourished, respectively (p = .059).  CONCLUSIONS: Immune function is impaired with an MNA score indicative of  malnutrition in nursing home elders with pressure ulcers.

AB  - Uneven hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction has been proposed to expose parts of the pulmonary capillary bed to high pressure and vascular injury in high-altitude  pulmonary edema (HAPE). We hypothesized that subjects with a history of HAPE  would demonstrate increased heterogeneity of pulmonary blood flow during hypoxia.  A functional magnetic resonance imaging technique (arterial spin labeling) was  used to quantify spatial pulmonary blood flow heterogeneity in three subject  groups: (1) HAPE-susceptible (n = 5), individuals with a history of  physician-documented HAPE; (2) HAPE-resistant (n = 6), individuals with repeated  high-altitude exposure without illness; and (3) unselected (n = 6), individuals  with a minimal history of altitude exposure. Data were collected in normoxia and  after 5, 10, 20, and 30 minutes of normobaric hypoxia FI(O(2)) = 0.125. Relative  dispersion (SD/mean) of the signal intensity was used as an index of perfusion  heterogeneity. Oxygen saturation was not different between groups during hypoxia.  Relative dispersion was not different between groups (HAPE-susceptible 0.94 +/-  0.05, HAPE-resistant 0.94 +/- 0.05, unselected 0.87 +/- 0.06; means +/- SEM)  during normoxia, but it was increased by hypoxia in HAPE-susceptible (to 1.10 +/-  0.05 after 30 minutes, p < 0.0001) but not in HAPE-resistant (0.91 +/- 0.05) or  unselected subjects (0.87 +/- 0.05). HAPE-susceptible individuals have increased  pulmonary blood flow heterogeneity in acute hypoxia, consistent with uneven  hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lidocaine is frequently used as an agent to treat ventricular arrhythmias associated with acute myocardial ischaemia. Lidocaine is a potent  blocker not only of sodium channels, but also of ATP-sensitive potassium  channels. The opening of these channels is a key mechanism of ischaemic  preconditioning. We investigated the hypothesis that lidocaine blocks the  cardioprotection induced by ischaemic preconditioning. METHODS: Isolated rat  hearts (n=60) were subjected to 30 min of no-flow ischaemia and 60 min of  reperfusion. Control hearts (CON) underwent no further intervention.  Preconditioned hearts (PC) received two 5-min periods of ischaemia separated by  10 min of reflow before the 30 min ischaemia. In three groups, lidocaine was  infused at concentrations of 2, 10 or 20 microg ml(-1) for 5 min before the  preconditioning ischaemia. Left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) and infarct  size (IS) (triphenyltetrazolium choride staining) were measured as variables of  ventricular function and cellular injury, respectively. RESULTS: PC reduced IS  from 24.8 (sem 4.1) % to 4.0 (0.7) % of the area at risk (P<0.05). Adding 2 or 10  microg ml(-1) lidocaine had no effect on IS compared with PC alone (3.7 (0.7) %,  6.9 (1.8) %). Adding 20 microg ml(-1) lidocaine increased IS to 14.1 (2.5) %  compared with PC (P<0.05). Baseline LVDP was similar in all groups (111.4 (2.1)  mm Hg). Compared with CON, PC improved functional recovery (after 60 min of  reperfusion; 52.3 (5.9) mm Hg vs 16.0 (4.0) mm Hg, P<0.01). The improved  ventricular function was not influenced by addition of 2 or 10 microg ml(-1)  lidocaine (47.3 (5.7) mm Hg, not significant; 45.3 (7.3) mm Hg, not significant),  but was blocked by the infusion of 20 microg ml(-1) lidocaine (22.5 (8.0) mm Hg,  P<0.01 vs PC). CONCLUSIONS: Lidocaine blocks the cardioprotection induced by  ischaemic preconditioning only at supratherapeutic concentrations.

AB  - S100B protein (S100B) has been described as a marker of brain injury. Various cytokines also increase in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with severe  traumatic brain injury (TBI). Thus, we investigated early changes in the  concentrations of CSF S100B and various cytokines after TBI and evaluated the  relations of both S100B and cytokines to intracranial pressure (ICP) and  prognosis. Twenty-three patients with severe TBI and a Glasgow Coma Scale score  of 8 or less on admission were included in this study. CSF and serum samples were  obtained on admission and at 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h after injury. CSF  concentrations of S100B and CSF and serum concentrations of five cytokines  (IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10) were measured and compared. The CSF  S100B concentration was increased for 6 h after injury and decreased thereafter.  The CSF concentrations of IL-6 and IL-8 peaked within 6 h after injury; other  cytokines (IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-10) were elevated for 24 h after injury  and gradually decreased thereafter. Peak CSF S100B concentrations correlated  significantly with ICP determined at the time CSF samples were taken (r = 0.729,  P < 0.0001). For the cytokines investigated, only the peak CSF IL-1beta  concentration correlated significantly and positively with the peak CSF S100B  concentration (r = 0.397, P < 0.005). Peak CSF concentrations of S100B (1649 +/-  415 microg/L, mean +/- SEM) and IL-1beta (16.5 +/- 3.3 pg/mL) in the 6 patients  with high ICP were significantly higher than those (233 +/- 67 microg/L, 7.6 +/-  1.7 pg/mL, respectively) in the 17 patients with low ICP (P < 0.05). The CSF  S100B concentration (1231 +/- 378 microg/L) in eight patients with an unfavorable  outcome was significantly higher than that (267 +/- 108 microg/L) in 15 patients  with a favorable outcome (P < 0.05). The CSF IL-1beta concentration (14.8 +/- 3.4  pg/mL) in eight patients with an unfavorable outcome tended to be higher than  that (7.3 +/- 1.5 pg/mL) in 15 patients with a favorable outcome (P = 0.057). CSF  concentrations of S100B and cytokines peak within 24 h after severe TBI and  decrease gradually thereafter. CSF S100B and IL-1beta may be useful as predictors  of outcome in cases of severe TBI.

AB  - Ischemia-reperfusion injury plays a major role in graft dysfunction following transplantation. Extensive research has demonstrated that nitric oxide (NO) plays  a fundamental role to protect the heart against this injury. Consequently, we  quantified NO synthase (NOS) isoform protein levels in a rat heart transplant  model during short and prolonged reperfusion following ischemia. Experiments were  performed using a modified Lewis to Lewis heterotopic abdominal heart  transplantation with a total ischemic time of 3 hours followed by 1 or 24 hours  of blood reperfusion (n = 12). Heart function, as represented by the rate  pressure product, increased from 7912 +/- 489 to 27067 +/- 9982 mm Hg/min (mean  +/- SEM, short vs prolonged reperfusion, P = .0027). NOS isoform protein levels  determined using Western blotting of freeze-clamped hearts were compared to  baseline values. eNOS protein levels were significantly lower during short  reperfusion compared to the basal value (P = .0077) or to prolonged reperfusion  (P = .004), returning to the basal value after 24 hours of reflow. iNOS protein  was not detected in the basal condition or after 1 hour of reflow, but was  present after 24 hours of reflow (P = .0001 vs basal value and 1-hour reflow).  nNOS protein was 69% lower after 1 hour of reflow compared with the baseline  value (P = .0001), it was not restored after 24 hours of reflow (P = .002). These  results suggest involvement of the NO pathway in ischemia-reperfusion injury with  distinctive roles of NOS isoforms during short and prolonged reperfusion  following ischemia.

AB  - Irrigation solution is routinely used in microsurgery. While the anticoagulation solution may aid in anastomotic patency, the direct effect of pressure irrigation  can have a detrimental effect on the vessel. An experimental study was performed  to determine the effect of irrigation pressure on the vessel wall. Histological  evaluation with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain and scanning electron  microscopy (SEM) was performed on the arteries of New Zealand white rabbits  irrigated with lactated Ringer's solution at pressures of 80 mmHg, 100 mmHg, and  500 mmHg. H&E staining and SEM microscopy demonstrated injury to the endothelial  cells and internal elastic lamina at pressures of 100 mmHg or greater.  Controlling microsurgical irrigation pressure to less than 100 mmHg may help to  avoid vessel injury.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study investigates the effectiveness of aerosol treatment on gas exchange and pulmonary inflammatory reaction using perfluorocarbons with  different molecular structure and vapor pressure. DESIGN: Experimental,  prospective, randomized, controlled study. SETTING: Experimental laboratory at a  university hospital. SUBJECTS: Twenty anesthetized neonatal piglets assigned to  four groups. INTERVENTIONS: After establishment of lung injury by bronchoalveolar  lavage, piglets either received aerosolized FC77 (n = 5), perfluorooctylbromide  (n = 5), or FC43 (n = 5, 10 mL x kg(-1) x hr(-1) for 2 hrs) or intermittent  mandatory ventilation (control, n = 5). Thereafter, animals were supported for  another 6 hrs. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Pao2 significantly improved in the  perfluorocarbon groups compared with control (p < .01). Final Pao2 (mean +/- SEM)  was FC77, 406 +/- 27 mm Hg; perfluorooctylbromide, 332 +/- 32 mm Hg; FC43, 406  +/- 19 mm Hg; control, 68 +/- 8 mm Hg. Paco2 and mean pulmonary arterial pressure  were lower in all perfluorocarbon groups compared with control. The ratio of  terminal dynamic compliance to total compliance was significantly higher in the  FC77 than in the FC43, perfluorooctylbromide, and control groups. Relative gene  expression of interleukin-1beta, interleukin-8, P-selectin, E-selectin, and  intercellular adhesion molecule-1 in lung tissue was determined by TaqMan real  time polymerase chain reaction normalized to  hypoxanthineguanine-phosphoribosyl-transferase and was shown to be reduced by all  perfluorocarbons. CONCLUSIONS: Aerosol treatment with all the perfluorocarbons  investigated improved gas exchange and reduced pulmonary inflammatory reaction  independently from molecular structure and vapor pressure of the  perfluorocarbons. Although differences in vapor pressure and molecular structure  may account for varying optimal dosing strategies, several different  perfluorocarbons were shown to be principally suitable for aerosol treatment.

AB  - We describe here a case of accidental electrocution. A 48-year-old male was found dead in his room. At autopsy, there was a current mark on the right thumb and big  toe. Histological examination revealed that the skin wound had the  characteristics of a current mark, including vacuolation and elongation of the  cell nuclei. We could also identify titanium metallization on the skin surface of  the current mark using a variable-pressure scanning electron microscope (VP-SEM)  equipped with energy dispersive X-ray microanalyser (EDX). The autopsy finding  and the subsequent investigation support the conclusion that the cause of his  death was electrocution. Our result shows that the VP-SEM with EDX is a useful  tool for the forensic diagnosis of electrocution.

AB  - In a porcine model of uncontrolled hemorrhagic shock, we evaluated the effects of vasopressin versus an equal volume of saline placebo versus fluid resuscitation  on hemodynamic variables and short-term survival. Twenty-one anesthetized pigs  were subjected to severe liver injury. When mean arterial blood pressure was <20  mm Hg and heart rate decreased, pigs randomly received either vasopressin IV (0.4  U/kg; n = 7), an equal volume of saline placebo (n = 7), or fluid resuscitation  (1000 mL each of lactated Ringer's solution and hetastarch; n = 7). Thirty  minutes after intervention, surviving pigs were fluid resuscitated while bleeding  was surgically controlled. Mean (+/- SEM) arterial blood pressure 5 min after the  intervention was significantly (P < 0.05) higher after vasopressin than with  saline placebo or fluid resuscitation (58 +/- 9 versus 7 +/- 3 versus 32 +/- 6 mm  Hg, respectively). Vasopressin improved abdominal organ blood flow but did not  cause further blood loss (vasopressin versus saline placebo versus fluid  resuscitation 10 min after intervention, 1343 +/- 60 versus 1350 +/- 22 versus  2536 +/- 93 mL, respectively; P < 0.01). Seven of 7 vasopressin pigs survived  until bleeding was controlled and 60 min thereafter, whereas 7 of 7 saline  placebo and 7 of 7 fluid resuscitation pigs died (P < 0.01). We conclude that  vasopressin, but not saline placebo or fluid resuscitation, significantly  improves short-term survival during uncontrolled hemorrhagic shock. IMPLICATIONS:  Although IV fluid administration is the mainstay of nonsurgical management of  trauma patients with uncontrolled hemorrhagic shock, the efficacy of this  strategy has been discussed controversially. In this animal model of severe liver  trauma with uncontrolled hemorrhagic shock, vasopressin, but not saline placebo  or fluid resuscitation, improved short-term survival.

AB  - AIMS: To determine the effect of hypoglycaemia on ischaemic retinal injury. METHODS: Rat retinal cultures were incubated in varying concentrations of glucose  while placed under standardised anoxic conditions, and the number of surviving  GABA immunoreactive neurons was assessed using immunocytochemistry. Hypoglycaemia  was induced in age and sex matched Wistar rats by an injection of rapid acting  insulin. The blood, vitreous, and retinal glucose concentrations were measured  using a hexokinase assay kit. Electroretinography, semiquantitative RT-PCR, and  histology were used to compare the functional and structural retinal injury in  these rats with the injury in appropriate controls after a period of pressure  induced retinal ischaemia. RESULTS: Retinal cultures maintained in low glucose  concentrations (<1 mM) had fewer surviving GABA immunoreactive neurons after an  anoxic insult compared with retinal cultures maintained in 5 mM glucose.  Hypoglycaemic rats had significantly lower vitreous glucose concentrations (0.57  (SEM 0.04) mM) than the control rats (3.1 (0.70) mM; p<0.001). The a-wave and  b-wave amplitudes of the hypoglycaemic rats after 3 and 7 days of reperfusion  were significantly lower than the amplitudes of the control rats. Furthermore,  the level of Thy-1 mRNA (a retinal ganglion cell marker) was significantly lower  in the hypoglycaemic group (p<0.001) and there was a corresponding exacerbation  of structural injury compared with the controls. CONCLUSION: Hypoglycaemia causes  a significant reduction in vitreous glucose levels and exacerbates ischaemic  retinal injury.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cerebral hypoxia (cerebral cortical oxygenation [Pbro2] < 20 mm Hg) monitored by direct measurement has been shown in animal and small clinical  studies to be associated with poor outcome. We present our preliminary results  observing Pbro2 in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). METHODS: A  prospective observational cohort study was performed. Institutional review board  approval was obtained. All patients with TBI who required measurement of  intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), and Pbro2 because  of a Glasgow Coma Scale score < 8 were enrolled. Data sets (ICP, CPP, Pbro2,  positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), Pao2, and Paco2) were recorded during  routine manipulation. Episodes of cerebral hypoxia were compared with episodes  without. Results are displayed as mean +/- SEM; t test, chi2, and Fisher's exact  test were used to answer questions of interest. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-one  data sets were abstracted from 20 patients. Thirty-five episodes of regional  cerebral hypoxia were identified in 14 patients. Compared with episodes of  acceptable cerebral oxygenation, episodes of cerebral hypoxia were noted to be  associated with a significantly lower mean Pao2 (144 +/- 14 vs. 165 +/- 8; p <  0.01) and higher mean PEEP (8.8 +/- 0.7 vs. 7.1 +/- 0.3; p < 0.01). Mean ICP and  CPP measurements were similar between groups. In a univariate analysis, cerebral  hypoxic episodes were associated with Pao2 < or = 100 mm Hg (p < 0.01) and PEEP >  5 cm H2O (p < 0.01), but not ICP > 20 mm Hg, CPP < or = 65 mm Hg, or Pac2 < or =  35 mm Hg. CONCLUSION: Cerebral oxymetry is confirmed safe in the patient with  multiple injuries with TBI. Occult cerebral hypoxia is present in the traumatic  brain injured patient despite normal traditional measurements of cerebral  perfusion. Further research is necessary to determine whether management  protocols aimed at the prevention of cerebral cortical hypoxia will affect  outcome.

AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of repeated treatments with a neuroprotective compound, R(-)-1-(benzo [b] thiophen-5-yl)-2-[2-(N, N-diethylamino) ethoxy]  ethanol hydrochloride (T-588), on retinal ganglion cell (RGC) survival in rat  eyes with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) or after optic nerve crush.  METHODS: An increase in IOP was induced by a single laser treatment to the  trabecular meshwork in one eye of adult Wistar rats. Crush injury was  unilaterally produced by clipping the optic nerve 2 mm behind the globe. RGC  density was estimated by counting fluorescent dye-labeled cells in the flatmount  of the retina. The optic nerve damage in the crush model was also evaluated  histologically. RESULTS: In the elevated IOP model, RGC survival decreased to  72.9% +/- 3.8% (mean +/- SEM) of that of the contralateral control eye on the  eighth day after laser irradiation. Repeated treatments with T-588 at 30 mg/kg  twice daily significantly enhanced RGC survival (86.0% +/- 2.2%, P = 0.0242)  without the reduction of IOP. In the optic nerve crush model, RGC survival  diminished to 37.2% +/- 8.4% of that of the contralateral control eye after 4  weeks. Repeated applications with T-588 at 10 mg/kg twice daily significantly  enhanced RGC survival (77.8% +/- 2.1%, P = 0.0038). Histologically, the rat optic  nerve in the group treated with T-588 at 10 mg/kg retained a near-normal  morphology. CONCLUSIONS: T-588 has a neuroprotective effect against RGC death  caused by elevated IOP and optic nerve crush in the rat.

T2  - Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pressure-volume relationships (PV curves) are the only available method for bedside monitoring of respiratory mechanics. Alveolar recruitment  modifies the results obtained from the PV curves. We hypothesized that  method-related differences may influence PV-curve guided ventilatory management.  METHODS: Twelve acute lung injury (ALI) patients [PaO2/FiO2 13.0 +/- 1.5 kPa  (97.6 +/- 11.3 mmHg), bilateral pulmonary infiltrates] were studied. Two PV  curves [one at variable, and another at constant level of positive end-expiratory  pressure (PEEP)] were obtained from each patient using constant inspiratory flow  and end-inspiratory and -expiratory occlusions. Upper and lower inflection points  (UIP, LIP) were estimated. Recruitment due to PEEP and during inflation was  assessed by respiratory inductive plethysmography (RIP). RESULTS: (1)  Pressure-volume curves at constant PEEP tended to provide higher LIP values  compared with curves at variable PEEP (mean difference +/- SEM 5.1 +/- 1.9  cmH2O); and (2) recruitment occurred throughout the PV curve with no relationship  with LIP or UIP. CONCLUSION: Pressure-volume curves obtained using variable PEEP  translate a different physiological reality and seem to be clinically more  relevant than curves constructed at constant PEEP. If curves constructed at  constant PEEP are used to set the ventilator, unnecessarily high PEEP levels may  be used. Respiratory inductive plethysmography technology may be used for  monitoring of recruitment at the bedside.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In order to reduce protein-energy malnutrition in older people during hospitalisation an early interdisciplinary intervention is needed. We developed a  protocol which includes screening for malnutrition, dysphagia and dehydration on  admission, followed by immediate interventions. OBJECTIVE: To assess  effectiveness of the protocol on nutritional status, hospital-acquired infections  and pressure sores, and to evaluate the protocol s economical feasibility.  DESIGN: Prospective, controlled study. SETTING: The inpatient geriatric service  of a university hospital (UMC Nijmegen) and a geriatric ward of a non-academic  teaching hospital (Rijnstate Hospital, Arnhem). SUBJECTS: 298 older patients (>60  years). METHODS: One of the geriatric wards applied the protocol (N=140) while  the other provided standard care (N=158). All non-terminally ill patients  admitted for more than two days were included. Body mass was measured on  admittance and discharge and hospital-acquired infections and pressure sores were  scored and costs related to nutrition, infections and length of hospital stay  were assessed. RESULTS: There was a 0.8 kg loss (SEM 0.3 kg) in average weight in  the standard care group and a 0.9 kg gain (SEM 0.2 kg) in the intervention group  (p<0.001). The number of hospital acquired infections was significantly lower in  the intervention group (33/140 versus 58/158, p=0.01) but no significant  difference in number of patients with pressure sores (23/140 versus 33/158) was  found. Costs were not significantly different: 7516 versus 7908 Euro/patient for  intervention versus controls, respectively. CONCLUSION: An early  interdisciplinary intervention approach can be effective in reducing  protein-energy malnutrition and related hospital-acquired infections and appears  to be economically feasible.

AB  - HYPOTHESIS: Studies indicate that a depressed wound immune function contributes to an increased rate of wound complications and impaired wound healing following  trauma-hemorrhage (T-H). Androgen, ie, 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone, is  responsible for producing the depressed systemic cell-mediated immune responses  following T-H in males. The aim of the present study was to determine whether  depletion of 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone in males before T-H has any salutary  effects on wound immune cell function and wound healing in male mice following  T-H. DESIGN: Mice were castrated or sham castrated 14 days before midline  laparotomy (ie, tissue trauma) and subcutaneous polyvinyl sponge implantation,  followed by hemorrhage (mean +/- SEM blood pressure, 35 +/- 5 mm Hg for 90  minutes and resuscitation) or sham operation. At 24 hours thereafter, wound  immune cells from the sponges were harvested and cultured with lipopolysaccharide  A. Release of interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta) and IL-6 (in picograms per  milliliter) was determined in the supernatants by enzyme-linked immunosorbent  assay. In addition, IL-6 was assessed at the wound site by immunohistochemistry.  Ten days after T-H, wound-breaking strength was measured. RESULTS: Precastration  prevented the significantly suppressed capacity of wound immune cells to release  IL-1 beta and IL-6. In addition, precastration normalized the elevated IL-6  expression at the wound site in the T-H mice. Moreover, wound-breaking strength  was improved in castrated mice 10 days after T-H. CONCLUSIONS: Male sex steroids  appear to be responsible for wound immune cell dysfunction following trauma and  severe blood loss. Because decreasing androgen levels resulted in improved wound  healing, our results suggest that the use of androgen receptor-blocking agents,  eg, flutamide, following T-H might represent a novel adjunct for decreasing the  rate of wound complications under those conditions.

T2  - The Journal of physiology
AB  - This study's rationale was that the expression and activity of aspartate transporters in hypertrophied hearts might be different from normal hearts, which  could affect the use of aspartate in myocardial protection of hypertrophied  hearts. mRNA expression of system X(ag)(-) transporters in hearts from normal  (Wistar Kyoto) and hypertrophied (spontaneously hypertensive rat) rats was  investigated by RT-PCR. EAAT3 protein expression in isolated cells and vesicles  from normal and hypertrophied hearts was investigated by Western blotting. The  same vesicles were also used to measure aspartate uptake. The effects of 0.5 mmol  l(-1) aspartate supplementation on cardiac performance during  ischaemia-reperfusion were investigated in isolated and perfused hearts. Both  normal and hypertrophied hearts expressed EAAT1 and EAAT3 mRNA. EAAT3 protein  expression was significantly greater in cells and vesicles from hypertrophied  hearts compared to normal hearts. The velocity (V(max)) of aspartate uptake was  faster at 24.4 +/- 2.2 pmol mg(-1) s(-1) in vesicles from hypertrophied hearts  compared to 8.2 +/- 0.8 pmol mg(-1) s(-1) (P < 0.001, t test, n= 6, means  +/-s.e.m.) in normal heart vesicles. The affinity (K(m)) was similar for both  preparations. When recoveries were matched, 0.5 mmol l(-1) aspartate addition  reduced reperfusion injury and increased functional recovery of hypertrophied  hearts but not normal hearts. This was associated with a greater preservation of  ATP, glutamate and glutamine and less lactate production during ischaemia in  aspartate-treated hypertrophied hearts compared to all other experimental groups.  These results suggest that increased aspartate transporter expression and  activity in hypertrophy helps facilitate aspartate entry into hypertrophied  cardiomyocytes, which in turn leads to improved myocardial protection.

AB  - Quantitative analysis of plasma phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide (PCOOH) is an important step in evaluating the biochemical processes leading to oxidative  injury. However, secondary products of lipid peroxidation are now used as  indices. One hundred nine alcoholic patients, aged 22-81 years (mean +/- SEM,  52.0 +/- 1.3 years), and 21 healthy volunteers, aged 41-79 years (51.2 +/- 2.2  years), participated in this study. Plasma PCOOH was measured by HPLC with  chemiluminescence detection. Plasma PCOOH concentration was significantly higher  in alcoholic patients (46.1 +/- 4.1 pmol/ml) than in controls (15.6 +/- 1.8  pmol/ml). It was significantly higher in patients with blood alcohol (88.0 +/-  10.5 pmol/ml) than in those without alcohol (32.6 +/- 3.1 pmol/ml). The patients  with high levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase,  gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GTP), and triglyceride (TG) showed  significantly higher PCOOH concentrations than did patients with normal levels.  The PCOOH level was positively correlated with levels of gamma-GTP, HDL, blood  alcohol concentration, and TG. Plasma PCOOH levels in 29 alcoholic patients after  a 6 week abstinence were decreased significantly (22.8 +/- 11.1 pmol/ml), which  was associated with improvement on liver function tests. This is the first  measurement of plasma PCOOH in alcoholic patients. These results suggest the  involvement of lipid peroxidation in alcohol-induced liver damage and confirm  that the PCOOH plasma concentration is a new marker of alcohol consumption as  well as oxidative stress in alcoholic patients.

AB  - Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) are important mediators produced during inflammation. We hypothesized that the  pro-inflammatory cytokine response in the interstitial fluid (IF) is different  from that in serum, and we aimed at quantifying the amount of TNF-alpha and  IL-1beta in the IF. By centrifugation of rat skin at < 424 g pure IF is  extracted. Using ELISA such fluid was analysed for cytokines in back and/or paw  skin of pentobarbital-anaesthetized rats, after either induction of endotoxaemia  or ischaemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. During endotoxaemia, TNF-alpha increased  in the IF from 0 in control to 640 +/- 100 pg ml(-1) (mean +/-s.e.m.) after 90  min, with the serum concentration being 5-10 times higher at all time points. The  response pattern of IL-1beta after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge differed  greatly from that of TNF-alpha with a large increase in IF from 390 +/- 90 to 28  000 +/- 1500 pg ml(-1) after 210 min, and a significantly smaller increase in  serum (600 +/- 45 pg ml(-1)). During reperfusion of the hind paw after 2 h of  ischaemia, there was a gradual increase of TNF-alpha in both IF of the paw skin  and serum after 3 min of reperfusion. Both declined after 20 min. The pattern for  IL-1beta differed, increasing significantly less in serum (25 +/- 15 pg ml(-1)  after 20 min of reperfusion) than in the IF (1100 +/- 200 pg ml(-1)).  Immunostaining of the inflamed tissues showed increased expression of the two  cytokines in cells of both epidermis and dermis compared to controls. Subdermal  injections of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta at the same concentrations found in IF after  LPS infusion affected interstitial fluid pressure significantly. Local TNF-alpha  production dominates after I/R injury, whereas in endotoxaemia systemic  production predominates. For IL-1beta local production dominates in both  conditions. Thus, there is a differential pattern of cytokine production and the  current method allows the study of the role of cytokines in IF during different  inflammatory reactions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) rupture is associated with a systemic inflammatory response syndrome, characterized by increased microvascular  permeability and neutrophil sequestration, leading to multiorgan dysfunction. We  examined the role of a novel complement factor 5a (C5aR) receptor antagonist, the  cyclic peptide AcF-(OpdChaWR), in attenuation of pathologic complement activation  and tissue injury in a model of AAA rupture. METHODS: Anesthetized rats were  randomized to sham (control) or shock and clamp (s+c) groups. Animals in the s+c  group underwent 1 hour of hemorrhagic shock (mean arterial blood pressure < or  =50 mm Hg), followed by 45 minutes of supramesenteric aortic clamping, then 2  hours of resuscitated reperfusion. Animals in the s+c group were randomized to  receive an intravenous bolus of C5aR antagonist at 1 mg/kg or saline solution  control at the end of hemorrhagic shock. Intestinal and pulmonary permeability to  iodine 125-labeled albumin was measured as an indicator of microvascular  permeability. Tissue myeloperoxidase activity, proinflammatory cytokine tissue  necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) protein and mRNA, and C5aR mRNA levels were  measured as indicators of neutrophil sequestration and inflammatory signaling,  respectively. RESULTS: Lung permeability index was significantly increased in the  s+c group compared with the sham group (4.43 +/- 0.96 vs 1.30 +/- 0.17; P <.01),  and prevented with treatment with C5aR antagonist (1.74 +/- 0.50; P <.03). Lung  myeloperoxidase activity was significantly increased in the the s+c group  compared with the sham group (2.41 +/- 0.34 U/mg vs 1.03 +/- 0.29 U/mg; P <.009),  and significantly attenuated with treatment with C5aR antagonist (1.11 +/- 0.09  U/mg; P <.006). Lung TNF-alpha protein levels were significantly elevated in both  s+c groups, whereas lung TNF-alpha mRNA expression was significantly  downregulated in both s+c groups compared with the sham group. Intestinal  permeability index was significantly increased in animals in the s+c groups  during reperfusion, compared with sham (P <.001), which was attenuated in early  reperfusion with treatment with C5a receptor antagonist. Data represent mean +/-  SEM, group comparisons with analysis of variance and post hoc Scheffé test.  CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that a potent antagonist of C5a receptor  protects the rat intestine and lung from neutrophil-associated injury in a model  of AAA rupture. These data suggest that complement-mediated inflammation can be  modulated at the C5a receptor level, independent of proinflammatory TNF-alpha  production, and prevent acute local and remote organ injury.

By using dynamic flow-loop mechanics,  we performed a prospective stepwise reduction of tidal volume (by reduction of  peak inspiratory pressure, keeping end-expiratory pressure constant), in a group  of LBW infants to identify the steepest slope of the dynamic flow-loop. We used  flow-synchronized, assist-control mechanical ventilation with termination  sensitivity set at 5%. Vital signs and blood gases were assessed every 15 minutes  at each stepped-pressure change during the first hour after enrollment and after  12 hours, to evaluate oxygenation and ventilation. Peak inspiratory pressure  (PIP) was selected at the lowest level that achieved target range blood gases.  The acute reduction of PIP and the resulting lower tidal volume was initially  associated with an increase in the spontaneous respiratory rate in the first hour  that also was associated with a significant decrease in patient-selected  inspiration time. After 12 hours, the spontaneous respiratory rate returned to  baseline; the peak PaCO(2) was 43.8 +/- 2.03 (mean +/- SEM). LBW infants have the  capacity to alter respiratory rate to change minute ventilation in response to a  reduction of tidal volume created by lowering the PIP. Using this model of  endogenous CO(2) challenge in ventilated infants, we conclude that LBW neonates  have the capacity to select a CO(2) set-point. This approach suggests an  important avenue through which a clinician can minimize volutrauma through a  reduction of PIP and use of expiratory trigger to limit excessive PIP and an  overall lower mean airway pressure.

AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Nitric oxide (NO) is a known selective dilator of the pulmonary vascular tree. There also is evidence that it plays a role in  diminishing neutrophil adherence to vascular endothelial cells. An understanding  of these effects of NO on the pulmonary microcirculation is essential to our  understanding of its mechanisms of action as well as its potential as a  therapeutic agent to reduce neutrophil sequestration and subsequent lung injury  and inflammation from a variety of conditions. This study examines the direct  effects of inhibition of endogenous NO synthesis with the L-arginine analog,  Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) on neutrophil accumulation within  the lung. METHODS: Lung samples from 2 groups of rats (n = 14 for each study  group) were studied. One group was given an intravenous infusion of L-NAME, and  the other received normal saline (NS), at 2 mg/kg/min for 1 hour. The  accumulation of neutrophils within the lungs was assessed quantitatively by  myeloperoxidase (MPO) assay as well as by microscopic examination by a  pathologist blinded to the 2 groups. RESULTS: The L-NAME group showed increased  MPO activity in the lung compared with the NS group (mean MPO/mean bicinchoninic  acid [BCA]: 43.46 +/- 3.10 U/microg v 23.58 +/- 2.48 U/microg; mean MPO/g wet  lung [gwl]: 57.60 +/- 5.98 U/gwl v 27.10 +/- 3.84 U/gwl, mean +/- SEM; P <.05).  Histologic examination (n = 6 each group) showed 26 +/- 2 neutrophils/5 hpf for  the L-NAME group versus 18 +/- 1 neutrophils/5 hpf for the NS group (P < 0.05).  CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that the inhibition of endogenous NO has a  direct effect of increasing neutrophil sequestration in the pulmonary vasculature  and alveoli. This suggests that endogenous NO plays a critical role in the  control of neutrophil-endothelial cell interactions in the lung.

AB  - The impact of high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) compared with intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV) on oxygenation and pulmonary  inflammatory response was studied in a surfactant depleted piglet model. After  establishment of lung injury by bronchoalveolar lavage, piglets either received  HFOV (n =5) or IMV (control; n = 5) for eight hours. PaO(2) was higher and mean  pulmonary arterial pressure (MPAP) was lower with HFOV (HFOV versus control, mean  +/- SEM; endpoint PaO(2): 252 +/- 73 versus 68 +/- 8.4 mm Hg; p < 0.001; MPAP: 22  +/- 2.3 versus 34 +/- 2.5 mm Hg; p < 0.01). mRNA expression of interleukin (IL)-1  beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TGF-beta 1, Endothelin-1, and adhesion molecules  (E-selectin, P-selectin, ICAM-1) in lung tissue was quantified by real time PCR  normalized to beta-actin and hypoxanthine-guanine-phosphoribosyl-transferase  (HPRT). mRNA expression of all cytokines and adhesion molecules/HPRT was higher  in controls (e.g.: HFOV versus control, mean +/- SEM; IL-1 beta/HPRT: 1.6 +/- 0.3  versus 23.1 +/- 8.6 relative units (RU), p < 0.001; IL-8/HPRT: 8.5 +/- 2.0 versus  63.5 +/- 15.2 RU, p < 0.001). IL-8/HPRT gene expression was quantified in  microdissected single cells. With HFOV, IL-8 gene expression was highly reduced  in alveolar macrophages: 10 +/- 3.4 copies IL-8 mRNA/copy HPRT mRNA versus 356  +/- 142; p < 0.05 (bronchiolar epithelial cells: 33 +/- 16 versus 208 +/- 108;  alveolar septum: 2.1 +/- 1.3 versus 26 +/- 11; bronchiolar smooth muscle cells:  1.3 +/- 0.3 versus 2.8 +/- 1.0; vascular smooth muscle cells: 0.7 +/- 0.3 versus  1.1 +/- 0.4). In conclusion, HFOV improved oxygenation, reduced pulmonary  arterial pressure and attenuated pulmonary inflammatory response.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In mechanically ventilated patients a high fraction of the pressure can be dissipated to overcome the viscoelastic components of the respiratory  system. Recently it was demonstrated that sigh improved oxygenation in  mechanically ventilated ARDS patients. We evaluated if, in acute lung injury  (ALI) patients, the sigh can be used to measure the respiratory viscoelastic  properties. METHODS: Ten consecutive normal subjects undergoing general  anaesthesia for minor abdominal surgery and ten ALI patients admitted to the ICU,  were studied. Three sighs were administered every minute during the measurement  period. The viscoelastic constants (E2, R2 and tau2) were determined by (i) a  series of end-inflation airway occlusions (multiple breath method, MBM) and (ii)  fitting the time course of the slow decay in pressure during end inspiratory  pause of the sigh (sigh method, SM). The results were compared by means of the  limits of agreement as modified for small sample sizes. RESULTS: Viscoelastic  parameters were similar to those obtained in other studies. In normal subjects  the mean differences (+/- SEM) of tau2, R2, and E2 given by the SM and the MBM  were 0 +/- 0.04 s, 0.37 +/- 0.20 cmH2O L(-1) s, and 0.21 +/- 0.26 cmH2O L(-1),  respectively. The mean differences (+/- SEM) of tau2, R2, and E2 in ALI patients  were 0.02 +/- 0.02 s, 0.45 +/- 0.31 cmH2O L(-1) s, 0.34 +/- 0.36 cmH2O L(-1),  respectively. No lack of agreement could be detected between the two methods in  all variables in normal subjects and ALI patients. CONCLUSIONS: The long  inflation time characteristic of the sigh allowed the determination of the  viscoelastic constants by means of a simpler and faster method. Moreover it does  not require very small tidal volumes, which can increase reabsorption atelectasis  in ALI patients and can improve alveolar recruitment and oxygenation in these  patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Injuries of tracheal mucosa in contact with tracheal tube cuff is a function of cuff pressure and exposure time. This study aimed at  analyzing injuries of tracheal mucosa in contact with tracheal tube cuff inflated  to reach "seal" pressure or limit 25 cmH2O pressure, below critical 30 cmH2O, to  prevent tracheal damage. METHODS: This study involved 16 dogs submitted to  intravenous anesthesia and artificial ventilation. Dogs were randomly distributed  into two experimental groups according to tracheal tube cuff pressure (Portex  Blue Line, UK): Gseal (n = 8) cuff with minimum "seal" pressure to prevent air  leakage during artificial ventilation; G25 (n=8) cuff inflated to 25 cmH2O. Cuff  pressure was measured with a digital manometer at the beginning of the experiment  (control) and 60, 120 and 180 minutes later. Animals were sacrificed and tracheal  mucosa areas adjacent to the tracheal tube cuff were biopsed by scanning  electronic microscopy (SEM). RESULTS: Mean cuff pressure was maintained between  24.8 and 25 cmH2O in G25 and between 11.9 and 12.5 cmH2O in Gseal. SEM changes  were mild and not significantly different between groups (p > 0.30), with more  severe injuries to tracheal areas in contact with the cuff as compared to areas  adjacent or not to tracheal tube (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In dogs under our  experimental conditions, tracheal tube cuff inflation to 25 cmH2O limit or to  "seal" pressure to prevent air leakage has determined minor injuries to the  tracheal mucosa in contact with tracheal tube cuff, without significant  differences between groups.

AB  - Shock-induced enhanced capillary permeability is associated with alterations in the interstitial matrix composition and contributes to organ damage. This study  was designed to evaluate albumin extravasation in various organ tissues during  severe, hemorrhagic shock without fluid resuscitation and reperfusion. Target  value of hemorrhagic shock was a reduction of cardiac output (CO) by 50% induced  by removal of blood. Twelve anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats (260-325 g) kept  under continuous hemodynamic monitoring were randomly assigned to a group of  hemorrhagic shock (n = 6) and a control group of normovolemic animals (n = 6).  After 30 min of shock 50 mg/kg b.w. Evans blue (EB) was injected intravenously  followed by an incubation period of 20 min. Exsanguination and wash out of the  intravascular space was performed by a pressure-controlled perfusion with  heparinized saline before harvesting organs to quantify albumin-bound EB  extravasation. We found that withdrawal of 4.7 +/- 0.4 mL (mean, +/-SEM) blood,  which accounts for 21.1% of the calculated total blood volume, resulted in a  reduction of CO from 36.1 +/- 3.1 to 19.4 +/- 2.7 mL/min. Simultaneously, MAP  decreased from 98 +/- 6 to 40 +/- 1 mmHg. In hemorrhaged rats, the interstitial  concentration of EB in lung and kidney was significantly higher than observed in  intact animals, whereas heart, spleen, liver, ileum, skeletal muscle, and skin  showed no significant microvascular damage. We conclude that despite the absence  of fluid resuscitation and reperfusion, microvascular damage in lung and kidney  is evident within the first thirty minutes of hemorrhagic shock.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and recruitment maneuvers (RMs) may partially reverse atelectasis and reduce ventilation-associated lung  injury. The purposes of this study were to assess a) magnitude and duration of RM  effects on arterial oxygenation and on requirements for oxygenation support  (Fio2/PEEP) in patients with acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress  syndrome (ALI/ARDS) receiving ventilation with low tidal volumes and high levels  of PEEP; and b) frequency of adverse respiratory and circulatory events  attributable to RMs. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, crossover study. SETTING:  Thirty-four intensive care units at 19 hospitals. PATIENTS: Seventy-two patients  with early ALI/ARDS. Baseline PEEP and Fio2 were 13.8 +/- 3.0 cm H2O and 0.39 +/-  0.10, respectively (mean +/- sd). INTERVENTIONS: We conducted RMs by applying  continuous positive airway pressure of 35-40 cm H2O for 30 secs. We conducted  sham RMs on alternate days. We monitored oxyhemoglobin saturation by pulse  oximetry (SpO2), Fio2/PEEP, blood pressure, and heart rate for 8 hrs after RMs  and sham RMs. We examined chest radiographs for barotrauma. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN  RESULTS: Responses to RMs were variable. Greatest increments from baseline SpO2  within 10 mins after RMs were larger than after sham RMs (1.7 +/- 0.2 vs. 0.6 +/-  0.3 %, mean +/- SEM, p < .01). Systolic blood pressure decreased more +/- 1.1 mm  Hg, p < .01). Changes in Fio2/PEEP requirements were not significantly different  at any time after RMs vs. sham RMs. Barotrauma was apparent on first radiographs  after one RM and one sham RM. CONCLUSIONS: In ALI/ARDS patients receiving  mechanical ventilation with low tidal volumes and high PEEP, short-term effects  of RMs as conducted in this study are variable. Beneficial effects on gas  exchange in responders appear to be of brief duration. More information is needed  to determine the role of recruitment maneuvers in the management of ALI/ARDS.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of cyclosporine and rapamycin administration on renal function after ischemia/reperfusion injury (I/R). Cyclosporine A has  known nephrotoxic effects. Thus, cyclosporine therapy subsequent to I/R injury  may further exacerbate graft dysfunction. Rapamycin is a newer agent that  suppresses the immune system by a different mechanism. METHODS: Male Wistar rats  (250 g) were anesthetized, and the suprarenal aorta was clamped for 40 minutes.  The right kidney was removed. After recovery, the rats were divided into four  groups: group 1, controls, no ischemia and no treatment (n = 10); group 2,  ischemia with no treatment (n = 8); group 3, ischemia plus rapamycin (0.17  mg/kg/day gavage, n = 8); and group 4, ischemia plus cyclosporine A (30 mg/kg/day  intraperitoneally, n = 9). The glomerular filtration rate was measured 5 to 7  days after I/R injury using urinary iohexol clearance. Data are expressed as the  mean +/- SEM, and intergroup comparisons were made using one-way analysis of  variance. RESULTS: The mean GFR value for the controls (no ischemia, no  treatment) was 1.23 +/- 0.08 mL/min; for group 2 (ischemia, no treatment), it was  1.05 +/- 0.10 mL/min; for group 3 (ischemia plus rapamycin) 1.06 +/- 0.14 mL/min;  and for group 4 (ischemia plus cyclosporine A) 0.44 +/- 0.06 mL/min (P <0.05  versus the other three groups). The mean arterial pressure was significantly  lower in the ischemic rats treated with cyclosporine A (P <0.05 versus the other  three groups). CONCLUSIONS: After I/R injury, rapamycin may preserve renal  function compared with cyclosporine treatment, because it does not have a direct  vasoconstrictor effect on the renal microcirculation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Arterialization of the portal vein (APV) has shown beneficial effects on liver regeneration and function in selected patients undergoing liver  resection and transplantation. Whether APV improves liver perfusion and function  in cirrhosis is unclear. This study investigated the effect of APV on hepatic  haemodynamics and liver function in a rat model of cirrhosis. METHODS: Male  Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300 g) were divided into three groups: normal controls  (n = 7), cirrhosis with sham laparotomy (sham; n = 7) and cirrhosis with APV  (APV; n = 9). Portal venous blood flow, portal vein pressure and hepatic  parenchymal microcirculation (HPM) were measured before and after APV. Hepatic  parenchymal oxygenation was assessed by near-infrared spectroscopy and  hepatocellular injury by standard liver function tests. Measurements were taken  at baseline, after APV and 7 days after surgery. RESULTS: APV increased portal  blood flow and pressure in cirrhotic rats without altering intrahepatic portal  resistance. APV increased the HPM in cirrhotic rats by a mean(s.e.m.) of  28.5(0.1) per cent on day 0 and 54.6(0.1) per cent by day 7 (P = 0.001). Liver  tissue oxygenation was increased by APV and the plasma  gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase level was reduced (mean(s.e.m.) 6.0(0.5) versus  3.8(0.3) units/l before and after APV respectively; P = 0.006) at day 7.  CONCLUSION: APV increases portal blood flow, tissue perfusion and oxygenation in  cirrhosis.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Prospective organ donors are exposed to various stress types. The effect of endotoxin pretreatment (ETX) on pancreatic ischemia/reperfusion injury  (IRI) is unclear. We investigated, using a rat model of pancreatic IRI of an in  situ isolated pancreatic tail segment, the effect of ETX on postischemic  microcirculation and organ damage. METHODS: Twenty-four hours before pancreatic  dissection, either intraperitoneal application of ETX (1 mg/kg in 0.9% NaCl) or  saline only (control) was performed. Two-hour normothermic ischemia of the  pancreatic tail was induced by clamping the splenic vessels and was followed by a  reperfusion period of 2 hours. Microcirculatory parameters were measured by  intravital epifluorescence microscopy [functional capillary density (FCD),  adherent leukocytes (ALs), and histology]. The presented data represent the mean  +/- SEM/SD as appropriate. RESULTS: ETX pretreatment caused a significantly  greater decrease in FCD (497 +/- 6 cm/cm2 baseline versus 326 +/- 15 cm/cm2 2  hours of reperfusion) compared with controls (498 +/- 8 versus 258 +/- 15 cm/cm2)  2 hours after reperfusion (P < 0.01). Two hours after reperfusion, ALs were  significantly decreased in ETX animals compared with controls (ETX: 141 +/- 37  versus 273 +/- 36 cells/mm2, P < 0.05). Histologic damage was less in ETX (6.4  score points +/- 0.32 versus 8.8 +/- 0.33 control, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: ETX  preconditioning decreases microcirculatory deterioration caused by IRI by means  of less loss of nutritive tissue perfusion, decrease in ALs, and less histologic  damage. This indicates a protective effect of ETX preconditioning in pancreatic  IRI.

AB  - Nitric oxide synthesized from L-arginine in cells has important salutary physiological roles, but can also exert deleterious effects. Nitric oxide (NO)  can ameliorate post-ischemic reperfusion myocardial injury, yet formation from NO  and O(2)z*(-) of peroxynitrite and its downstream toxic products, such as *OH,  *NO(2) and CO(3)*(-), can ultimately exacerbate reperfusion damage. Nitroxide  stable radicals, such as 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TPL),  unlike SOD, readily penetrate cells and catalytically remove intracellular  O(2)*(-). Hence, nitroxides by virtue of catalytic removal of O(2)*(-) would be  expected to diminish the adverse effect of NO and lower post-ischemic reperfusion  cardiac damage. We show that post-ischemic recovery of hemodynamic functions of  isolated perfused rat hearts treated with L-arginine or TPL alone did not differ  from that of the control hearts. However, the recovery of hearts treated with the  combined regimen of L-arginine and TPL was significantly improved, e.g. the Work  Index=(left ventricular developed pressure x heart rate) recovered to 92+/-1.6%  (L-arginine and TPL) vs. 59.4+/-5.4% (Control), 60+/-2.9% (L-arginine) and  53.3+/-4.3% (TPL) of the pre-ischemic value; mean+/-SEM, N=10, P<0.001. The  enhanced recovery of hemodynamic function of hearts treated with L-arginine and  TPL was accompanied by an increased recovery of oxygen consumption during the  reperfusion. The combined regimen of L-arginine and TPL reduces the negative  effects of NO by either inhibiting the production of ONOO(-) or through reaction  with CO(3)z.rad;(-) and *NO(2) radicals formed during the decomposition of  peroxynitrite in the presence of bicarbonate, thus promoting cardioprotection  following post-ischemic reperfusion.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of intravenous lipopolysaccharide on systemic and cerebral haemodynamics and oxygenation in the preterm ovine fetus.  DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: Research centre for perinatal  brain injury. SAMPLE: Nine fetal sheep at circa 93 days of gestation (0.65).  METHODS: Fetal sheep were chronically instrumented with arterial and venous  catheters and a flow probe in the carotid artery. Near-infrared spectroscopy was  used to measure changes in cerebral oxygenation and total haemoglobin  concentration. Three days after surgery, each fetus was given 100 ng/kg  Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide. Observations were continued for 48 hours  post-injection and compared with baseline control values. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:  Fetal heart rate, mean arterial pressure, carotid blood flow. RESULTS: Three  fetuses died after administration of the lipopolysaccharide. In the survivors  fetal heart rate rose from 193 (SEM 7) to a mean maximal level of 226 (SEM 31  bpm) (P = 0.01) after 6.5 (SEM 1.0) hours. The mean arterial pressure decreased  from 40.5 (SEM 4.2) to 29.4 (SEM 1.6) mmHg (P < 0.05) after 7.0 (SEM 2.0) hours,  and carotid blood flow increased from 29.6 (SEM 1.6) to 45.8 (SEM 5.7) mL/min (P  = 0.0002) at 12 (SEM 3) hours. All values returned to control levels by 48 hours.  Histological assessment showed evidence of periventricular leucomalacia in three  out of six brains studied. CONCLUSION: These data do not suggest that cerebral  ischaemia is the main aetiological factor in endotoxin-related fetal brain  injury. Fetal tachycardia and cerebral vasodilation may indicate endotoxaemia in  fetuses exposed to prenatal infection.

AB  - The present study investigated whether heat stress-induced cardioprotection involves alterations in the pattern of p38 mitogen activated protein kinase  (p38MAPK) and c-Jun NH2 - terminal kinase (JNK) activation during ischaemia -  reperfusion in a model of isolated perfused rat heart. Wistar rats were subjected  to whole-body hyperthermia at 42 degrees C for 15 min (HS), while untreated  animals served as controls (CON). Twenty four hours later, CON and HS isolated  hearts were perfused in a Langendorff mode and subjected to 20 min of zero-.ow  global ischaemia followed by 45 min of reperfusion. Postischaemic recovery of  left ventricular developed pressure at 45 min of reperfusion was expressed as %  of the initial value (LVDP%). Activation of p38 MAPK and JNK was assessed by  standard Western blotting techniques using a dual phospho-p38 MAPK and  phospho-p46 JNK and p54 JNK antibodies. The levels of phospho-p38 MAPK at the end  of reperfusion were not different in HS as compared to CON hearts. The levels of  phospho-p46 JNK and p54 JNK were 1.4- and 1.6-fold less in HS than in CON hearts  respectively, p < 0.05. LVDP% was 60.3 (s.e.m., 6.3) for HS and 42.9 (4.1) for  CON, p < 0.05. In summary, heat stress pretreatment improves postischaemic  recovery of function in isolated rat hearts and this is associated with  suppressed JNK activation in response to ischaemia-reperfusion.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Vascular photodynamic therapy (PDT) inhibits intimal hyperplasia (IH) induced by angioplasty in rat iliac arteries by eradicating the  proliferating smooth muscle cells. This process may jeopardise the structure and  strength of the arterial wall, reflected by a decreased bursting pressure. STUDY  DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty male Wistar rats of 250-300 g were  subdivided into 3 groups (n = 10). In all groups, IH was induced by balloon  injury (BI). One experimental group received PDT at 50 J/cm diffuser length, the  other group at 100 J/cm diffuser length. The third group served as control group  and received no PDT. In half of each group the bursting pressure was analyzed  after 2 hours (n = 5), in the other half after 1 year. RESULTS: Two hours after  the procedure the bursting pressure was 3.37 +/- 0.58 (+/-SEM) bar in the BI +  PDT 50 and 3.96 +/- 0.43 bar in the BI + PDT 100 group, compared to 2.20 +/- 0.27  bar in the BI group (P < 0.05). After 1 year these values were 3.18 +/- 0.87 bar  in the BI + PDT 50 (P < 0.05) and 2.02 +/- 0.31 bar in the BI + PDT 100 group,  compared to 2.10 +/- 0.30 bar in the BI group (NS). In the BI + PDT 100 group, 3  out of 5 rats appeared to have aneurysmal dilatation after 1 year. CONCLUSIONS:  Endovascular PDT increases the arterial wall strength as measured by the bursting  pressure at short-term. After 1 year, wall strength is not diminished as measured  by bursting pressure, but aneurysmal dilatation nevertheless developed with 100  J/cm. dl. This may limit the use of high energy PDT.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We tested the hypothesis that sodium-hydrogen exchange inhibition attenuates ventricular dysfunction after ischemia-reperfusion injury in the  intact porcine heart. METHODS: Twelve pigs (weight, 30-45 kg) were evenly divided  into 2 groups. Baseline ventricular function studies were based on  echocardiography, conductance, aortic flow, and left ventricular pressure.  Animals were given vehicle (control) or  benzamide-N-(aminoiminomethl)-4-(4-[2-furanylcarbonyl]-1-piperazinyl)-3-(methylsulfonyl)methanesulfonate  (BIIB 513; 3 mg/kg administered intravenously). Ten minutes later, hearts were  subjected to 75 seconds of ventricular fibrillation. After reperfusion for 40  minutes, function studies were repeated. Hearts were arrested and excised.  Postmortem data included passive pressure-volume curves and myocardial water  content. RESULTS: Preload recruitable stroke work was significantly decreased  from baseline after ischemia and reperfusion in the control group (27.7 +/- 2.5  vs 48.0 +/- 5.6 mm Hg [+/- SEM], P =.001) but not in the BIIB 513 group (43.0 +/-  5.8 vs 45.5 +/- 4.1 mm Hg, P = not significant). In vivo diastolic and postmortem  passive left ventricular compliance were reduced after ischemia and reperfusion  for control animals but remained unchanged for animals receiving BIIB 513. Time  required to recover baseline blood pressure after ventricular fibrillation was  significantly longer for control animals (159 +/- 15 vs 88 +/- 14 seconds [+/-  SEM], P =.008). Myocardial water content (78.97% +/- 0.94% vs 77.86% +/- 0.46%  [+/- SEM]) and normalized left ventricular mass (137.24 +/- 6.17 vs 128.41 +/-  1.96 g [+/- SEM]) were insignificantly increased in control animals. CONCLUSIONS:  Sodium-hydrogen exchange inhibition attenuates ventricular dysfunction after 75  seconds of ventricular fibrillation and 40 minutes of reperfusion. This family of  agents might prove useful in patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction  undergoing ventricular fibrillation for implantable cardioverter defibrillator  testing.

TI  - Plasticity in action of intrathecal clonidine to mechanical but not thermal nociception after peripheral nerve injury.
AU  - Paqueron, Xavier
AU  - Conklin, Dawn
AU  - Eisenach, James C.
T2  - Anesthesiology
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intrathecal clonidine reduces tactile allodynia in animal models of neuropathic pain, and this effect is blocked by atropine. However, the role of  tonic spinal cholinergic activity and its interaction with alpha2-adrenergic  systems in normal and neuropathic conditions and to different sensory methods has  not been systematically examined. The authors examined cholinergic receptor  involvement in thermal and mechanical sensitivity in normal and neuropathic  animals and its interaction with intrathecal clonidine. METHODS: Normal rats and  rats that received L5/L6 spinal nerve ligation were tested with acute radiant  heat, paw pressure, and punctate mechanical stimulation before and after the  intrathecal administration of saline, the muscarinic receptor antagonist,  atropine, or a toxin to destroy cholinergic neurons, and then after intrathecal  clonidine. RESULTS: Atropine, the cholinergic neuronal toxin, and saline did not  alter baseline withdrawal thresholds. In nerve-injured rats, neither saline nor  atropine altered antinociception from clonidine to a thermal stimulus, but  atropine reduced the effect of clonidine to von Frey filament withdrawal  threshold (34 +/- 5.6 vs. 14 +/- 5.8 g [mean +/- SEM], saline vs. atropine; P <  0.05) and to withdrawal threshold to paw pressure after clonidine (174 +/- 18 g  vs. 137 +/- 16 g, saline vs. atropine; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest  that after nerve injury, mechanical but not thermal antinociception from  intrathecal clonidine relies on a muscarinic interaction, because only mechanical  antinociception was antagonized by atropine. These results do not favor a  regulation of nociceptive transmission by a tonic release of acetylcholine in  nerve-injured rats.

T2  - European journal of vascular and endovascular surgery : the official journal of the European Society for Vascular Surgery
AB  - OBJECTIVES: to investigate the relationship between clinical severity of venous disease, calf muscle pump dysfunction and range of ankle movement (ROAM).  MATERIALS AND METHODS: ROAM was assessed by goniometry in the supine,  nonweightbearing position. Calf muscle pump function was assessed by ambulatory  venous pressure (AVP), calculating the pressure relief index (PRI). Venous  disease was classified according to the CEAP classification (International  Consensus Committee reporting standards on venous disease). Forty seven limbs in  38 adults were recruited and matched for age: 11 normal controls CEAP(0), 12  varicose veins CEAP(2), 12 chronic venous insufficiency CEAP(4,5) and 12 active  ulceration CEAP(6). RESULTS: mean (S.E.M.) age was 60.7 (1.3) years. Mean  (S.E.M.) PRI was 1959.6 (313.7) in CEAP(0), 905.3 (139.3) in CEAP(2), 596.5  (148.5) in CEAP(4,5) and 170.6 (69.0) in CEAP(6) (p < 0.001, ANOVA). Mean  (S.E.M.) ROAM was 61.3 (2.0) degrees in CEAP(0), but significantly reduced to  49.7 (2.0) in CEAP(2), 42.1 (2.6) in CEAP(4,5) and 40.9 (2.7) in CEAP(6) (p <  0.004, ANOVA post hoc Tukey). PRI correlated with ROAM (p < 0.001, Pearson  correlation coefficientr = 0.52). CONCLUSIONS: limbs with venous hypertension  have a reduced range of ankle movement related to the clinical severity of venous  disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether extracellular concentrations of glutamate and other amino acids are significantly elevated after intracerebral hemorrhage and,  if so, the temporal characteristics of these changes. Although the role of  excitotoxic amino acids, particularly that of glutamate, has been described in  ischemic stroke and head trauma, no information exists regarding their possible  contribution to the pathogenesis of neuronal injury in intracerebral hemorrhage.  DESIGN: Prospective, controlled, laboratory trial. SETTINGS: Animal research  laboratory. SUBJECTS: Sixteen anesthetized New Zealand rabbits. INTERVENTION: We  introduced intracerebral hemorrhage in each of eight anesthetized New Zealand  rabbits by injecting 0.4 mL of autologous blood under arterial pressure into the  deep gray matter of the cerebrum. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Extracellular  fluid samples were collected from the perihematoma region and contralateral  (right) hemisphere by in vivo microdialysis at 30-min intervals for 6 hrs.  Corresponding samples were similarly collected from both hemispheres in each of  eight control animals that underwent needle placement without introduction of a  hematoma. Concentrations of amino acids (glutamate, aspartate, asparagine,  glycine, taurine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid) in the samples were measured by  use of high-pressure liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. Glutamate  concentrations (mean +/- sem) were significantly higher in the hemisphere  ipsilateral to the hematoma than in the contralateral hemisphere (92 +/- 22  pg/microL vs. 22 +/- 6 pg/microL) at 30 mins after hematoma creation. A  significant increase was observed at 30 mins posthematoma creation in the  hemisphere ipsilateral to the hematoma compared with the baseline value. A  nonsignificant increase in glutamate concentration persisted in the hemisphere  ipsilateral to the hematoma, ranging from 134% to 187% of baseline value between  1 and 5 hrs after hematoma creation. In the hemisphere ipsilateral to the  hematoma, a three-fold increase in the concentration of glycine was observed at  30 mins after hematoma creation compared with the baseline level (890 +/- 251  pg/microL vs. 291 +/- 73 pg/microL). There was a significant difference between  the hemisphere ipsilateral to the hematoma compared with the ipsilateral  (corresponding) hemisphere of the control group at 30 mins posthematoma (890 +/-  251 pg/microL vs. 248 +/- 66 pg/microL). A similar transient increase was  observed in taurine and asparagine concentrations at 30 mins after hematoma  creation, compared with baseline measurements. Taurine concentrations in the  hemisphere ipsilateral to the hematoma were significantly higher than the  ipsilateral hemisphere of the control group (622 +/- 180 pg/microL vs. 202 +/- 64  pg/microL) at 30 mins after hematoma creation. CONCLUSIONS: The present study  suggests that glutamate and other amino acids accumulate transiently in  extracellular fluids in the perihematoma region during the early period of  intracerebral hemorrhage. The exact role of these amino acids in the pathogenesis  of neuronal injury observed in intracerebral hemorrhage needs to be defined.

AB  - PURPOSE: To functionally characterize the status of the rat retina and optic nerve after acute elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) and to determine the  dynamics of the pathologic changes in the ischemic retina and optic nerve.  METHODS: Retinal ischemia was induced in rats by acutely increasing the IOP (110  mm Hg/60 minutes). Direct and indirect pupil light reflexes (PLRs) were recorded  from the noninjured eye, and electroretinograms (flash and flicker ERG) were  recorded from the injured and control eyes before and after surgery. Amplitudes  and latencies were calculated for each recording session. RESULTS: Preoperative  PLR(ratio)s (indirect/direct PLR) were 76.7 +/- 2.6 (mean +/- SEM). Twenty-four  hours after surgery the PLR(ratio) was 15.2 +/- 12.8, 10 days after surgery, 11.6  +/- 9.8; 20 days after surgery, 26.5 +/- 8.0; and 28 days after surgery, 33.27  +/- 9.3. However, at day 35, the PLR had significantly recovered (41.1 +/- 7.3)  when compared with the 24-hour postoperative ratios (P < 0.01, repeated-measures  ANOVA). Forty-two days after surgery, the PLR(ratio) started to decrease once  again in the injured eyes (28.7 +/- 5.9). Electroretinographic amplitudes  (full-field flash ERG) followed a similar pattern. Cone responses (flicker ERG)  were measured 42 days after surgery and revealed defects in injured eyes (control  eyes: 46.6 +/- 2.9 microV, injured eyes: 3.4 +/- 1.7 microV). Histologic analysis  revealed ischemic damage to all retinal layers, with the primary defects  localized to the central retina. CONCLUSIONS: Acute ocular ischemia causes a  significant decrease in retinal function, as measured by PLR and ERG, although  over time the rat retina and optic nerve show partial regain of function.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To analyze, in acute renal failure (ARF) in diabetic rats, how moderate functional ARF would modify metformin (MET) pharmacokinetics and if  plasma and renal tissue MET accumulation could aggravate renal insufficiency  and/or elicit plasma lactate accumulation. METHODS: Streptozotocin-induced  diabetic rats were allocated to four groups: control, MET, ARF, ARF-MET (6-7 rats  per group). MET (100 mg/kg/day) was given per os for two weeks before ARF was  induced by drinking restriction and enalapril treatment. The effects of MET  and/or ARF were examined in vivo on renal function in conscious rats (metabolic  cages) and ex vivo on renal vascular reactivity (isolated kidney). RESULTS: MET  treatment (plasma level: 5.3 +/- 1.4 microg/ml, mean+/-SEM), resulted in  biguanide accumulation in cortex and medulla (53 +/- 17 and 80 +/- 40 microg/g  respectively). MET was devoid of any effect on creatinine clearance, mean blood  pressure or renal vascular resistance, but moderately increased plasma lactate  (3.8 +/- 0.5 vs 3.2 +/- 0.2 mM, P<0.05) and decreased angiotensin II-induced  renal vasoconstriction. ARF, although mild, decreased renal MET clearance (0.29  +/- 0.05 vs 1.01 +/- 0.31 ml/min/100 g, P<0.05) and increased plasma and renal  tissue MET levels (x 2-4). MET however did not worsen the fall in glomerular  filtration rate, nor modify renal vascular reactivity. ARF did not change the  MET-elicited moderate increase in plasma lactate. CONCLUSION: Despite the  increase in MET plasma and renal tissue levels subsequent to moderate ARF, no  harmful metabolic effect on plasma lactate and no further impairment of renal  function was observed in MET-treated diabetic rats subjected to ARF.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Epinephrine is widely used for treatment of life-threatening hypotension, although new vasopressor drugs may merit evaluation. The purpose of  this study was to determine the effects of vasopressin vs. epinephrine vs. saline  placebo on hemodynamic variables, regional blood flow, and short-term survival in  an animal model of uncontrolled hemorrhagic shock and delayed fluid  resuscitation. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, laboratory investigation that  used a porcine model for measurement of hemodynamic variables and regional  abdominal organ blood flow. SETTING: University hospital laboratory. SUBJECTS: A  total of 21 pigs weighing 32 +/- 3 kg. INTERVENTIONS: The anesthetized pigs were  subjected to a penetrating liver injury, which resulted in a mean +/- sem loss of  40% +/- 5% of estimated whole blood volume within 30 mins and mean arterial  pressures of <20 mm Hg. When heart rate declined progressively, pigs randomly  received a bolus dose and continuous infusion of either vasopressin (0.4 units/kg  and 0.04 units.kg-1.min-1, n = 7), or epinephrine (45 microg/kg and 5  microg.kg(-1).min(-1), n = 7), or an equal volume of saline placebo (n = 7),  respectively. At 30 mins after drug administration, all surviving animals were  fluid resuscitated while bleeding was surgically controlled. MEASUREMENTS AND  MAIN RESULTS: Mean +/- sem arterial blood pressure at 2.5 and 10 mins was  significantly (p <.001) higher after vasopressin vs. epinephrine vs. saline  placebo (82 +/- 14 vs. 23 +/- 4 vs. 11 +/- 3 mm Hg, and 42 +/- 4 vs. 10 +/- 5 vs.  6 +/- 3 mm Hg, respectively). Although portal vein blood flow was temporarily  impaired by vasopressin, it was subsequently restored and significantly (p <.01)  higher when compared with epinephrine or saline placebo (9 +/- 5 vs. 121 +/- 3  vs. 54 +/- 22 mL/min and 150 +/- 20 vs. 31 +/- 17 vs. 0 +/- 0 mL/min,  respectively). Hepatic and renal artery blood flow was significantly higher  throughout the study in the vasopressin group; however, no further bleeding was  observed. Despite a second bolus dose, all epinephrine- and saline  placebo-treated animals died within 15 mins after drug administration. By  contrast, seven of seven vasopressin-treated animals survived until fluid  replacement, and 60 mins thereafter, without further vasopressor therapy (p  <.01). Moreover, blood flow to liver, gut, and kidney returned to normal values  in the postshock phase. CONCLUSIONS: Vasopressin, but not epinephrine or saline  placebo, improved short-term survival in a porcine model of uncontrolled  hemorrhagic shock after liver injury when surgical intervention and fluid  replacement was delayed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In addition to the known beneficial effects of ascorbic acid on wound healing and the immune response, it is also a potent extracellular antioxidant.  Recent work in septic rats suggests that high-dose ascorbic acid total parenteral  nutrition (TPN) supplementation may protect cells from free radical injury and  improve survival. In this study, we determined ascorbic acid levels in the  immediate post-injury/illness period and evaluated the ability of early  short-term high levels of ascorbic acid in TPN to normalize plasma levels.  MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ascorbic acid levels were determined in 12 critically  injured patients and 2 patients with severe surgical infections. Each patient  received TPN supplemented with increasing doses of ascorbic acid over a 6-day  period. Therapeutic responses were determined by plasma and urine measurements  using high-pressure liquid chromatography. RESULTS: The initial mean +/- SEM  baseline plasma ascorbic acid concentration was depressed (0.11 +/- 0.03 mg/dl)  and unresponsive following 2 days on 300 mg/day supplementation (0.14 +/- 0.03; P  = 1.0) and only approached low normal plasma levels following 2 days on 1000  mg/day (0.32 +/- 0.08; P = 0.36). A significant increase was noted following 2  days on 3000 mg/day (1.2 +/- 0.03; P = 0.005). CONCLUSION: We confirmed extremely  low plasma levels of ascorbic acid following trauma and infection. Maximal early  repletion of this vitamin requires rapid pool filling early in the post-injury  period using supraphysiologic doses for 3 or more days.

AB  - Previous studies of the fracture properties of cortical bone have suggested that the fracture toughness increases with crack length, which is indicative of rising  R-curve behavior. Based on this indirect evidence and the similarity of bone to  ceramic matrix composites, we hypothesized that bone would exhibit rising R-curve  behavior in the transverse orientation and that the characteristics of the  R-curves would be regionally dependent within the cortex due to variations in  bone microstructure and toughening mechanisms. To test these hypotheses, we  conducted R-curve experiments on specimens from equine third metacarpal bones  using standard fracture mechanics testing methods. Compact type specimens from  the dorsal and lateral regions in the middle of the diaphysis were oriented for  crack propagation transverse to the longitudinal axis of the bone. The test  results demonstrate that equine cortical bone exhibits rising R-curve behavior  during transverse crack propagation as hypothesized. Statistical analyses of the  crack growth initiation toughness, K0, the peak toughness, Kpeak, and the crack  extension at peak toughness, deltaa, revealed significant regional differences in  these characteristics. Specifically, the lateral cortex displayed higher crack  growth initiation and peak toughnesses. The dorsal cortex exhibited greater crack  extension at the peak of crack growth resistance. Scanning electron microscopy  revealed osteon pullout on fracture surfaces from the dorsal cortex and but not  in the lateral cortex. Taken together, the significant differences in R-curves  and the SEM fractography indicate that the fracture mechanisms acting in equine  cortical bone are regionally dependent.

AB  - Perfluorochemical (PFC) fluids of different physical properties were titrated and tested in vitro for physical properties that are appropriate for respiratory  application. Two PFC liquids were studied: perfluoromethylcyclohexane (PP2), a  liquid with high vapor pressure and low viscosity, and perfluoromethyldecalin  (PP9), a fluid with low vapor pressure and high viscosity. Eighteen rabbits (2.05  +/- 0.07 kg; mean +/- SEM) were lung-lavaged and randomized: group I, control  group; group II, partial liquid ventilation with 75% PP2 and 25% PP9; group III,  partial liquid ventilation with 50% PP2 and 50% PP9; and group IV, partial liquid  ventilation with 25% PP2 and 75% PP9. Ventilator volumes were kept constant  during the 4-h experiment. Cardiopulmonary measurements were performed every 30  min. The lung histology was examined. The in vitro study showed PFC  [viscosity/vapor pressure (in cS and mm Hg, respectively)] as follows: 100% PP2  (0.88/141); 100% PP9 (3.32/2.9); 75% PP2 and 25% PP9 (1.26/107); 50% PP2 and 50%  PP9 (1.63/13.7); and 25% PP2 and 75% PP9 (2.21/4.4). The in vivo experiments  found that combinations of moderate vapor pressure (groups 3 and 4) demonstrated  good gas exchange, compliance, and histologic findings. Thus, combinations of PFC  liquids can be formulated to modulate the physiologic outcome in acutely injured  lungs, and may prove useful for alternative PFC liquid applications.

AB  - The Volume Diffusive Respirator (VDR) is a high-frequency time cycled pressure ventilator that can ventilate, oxygenate, and promote secretion removal. The VDR  provides ventilation at lower airway pressures than those required for  conventional ventilation in the pressure control mode (PCV). A prospective,  randomized, institutional review board-approved study was conducted comparing the  VDR to PCV in burned children with respiratory failure from all causes. METHODS:  Pediatric burn patients requiring ventilation were stratified by presence of  inhalation injury and ventilated by VDR or PCV to achieve predefined arterial  blood gases. RESULTS: Sixty-four patients were prospectively assigned ventilator  type; 32 to VDR, 32 to PCV. Data are reported as mean + SEM. Patient age was 7.4  + 0.7 years, TBSA was 56 + 3%, and number of patients with inhalation injuries  was 55 (86%). Maximum peak inspiratory pressure with the VDR was significantly  less than with PCV (30.9 + 0.8 cm H2O vs 39.5 + 1.8 cm H2O,P < 0.05) and the best  PaO2 /FIO2 ratio was significantly higher with the VDR compared with PCV (563 +  15 vs 507 + 13, P < 0.05). No patient in the VDR group had evidence of barotrauma  compared with two in the PCV group. Five patients in the PCV group died compared  with two in the VDR group. CONCLUSION: Patients ventilated with the VDR required  significantly lower peak inspiratory pressure and achieved a significantly higher  PaO2 /FIO2 ratio compared with PCV. This demonstrates the VDR is a safe and  effective method of ventilation for pediatric burn patients and it offers  advantages when compared with conventional ventilation.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: The potential clinical benefits of pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) over volume-controlled ventilation (VCV) in patients with acute  lung injury (ALI) or ARDS still remain debated. We compared PCV with VCV in  patients with ALI/ARDS with respect to the following physiologic end points: (1)  gas exchange and airway pressures, and (2) CT scan intrapulmonary gas  distribution at end-expiration. DESIGN: Prospective, observational study.  SETTING: A multidisciplinary ICU in a nonuniversity, acute-care hospital.  PATIENTS: Ten patients with ALI or ARDS (9 men and 1 woman; age range, 17 to 80  years). INTERVENTIONS: Sequential ventilation in PCV and VCV with a constant  inspiratory/expiratory ratio, tidal volume, respiratory rate, and total positive  end-expiratory pressure; measurement of gas exchange and airway pressures; and  achievement of CT sections at lung base, hilum, and apex for the quantitative  analysis of lung densities and of aerated vs nonaerated zones. RESULTS: PaO(2),  PaCO(2), and PaO(2)/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio levels did not differ  between PCV and VCV. Peak airway pressure (Ppeak) was significantly lower in PCV  compared with VCV (26 +/- 2 cm H(2)O vs 31 +/- 2 cm H(2)O; p < 0.001; mean +/-  SEM). The surface areas of the nonaerated zones as well as the total areas at  each section level were unchanged in PCV compared with VCV, except at the apex  level, where there was a significantly greater nonaerated area in VCV (11 +/- 2  cm(2) vs 9 +/- 2 cm(2); p < 0.05). The total mean CT number of each lung (20  lungs from 10 patients) was similar in the two modes, as were the density values  at the basal and apical levels; the hilum mean CT number was - 442 +/- 28  Hounsfield units (HU) in VCV and - 430 +/- 26 HU in PCV (p < 0.005). CONCLUSIONS:  These data show that PCV allows the generation of lower Ppeaks through the  precise titration of the lung distending pressure, and might be applied to avoid  regional overdistension by means of a more homogeneous gas distribution.

TI  - Acoustic trauma induces reemergence of the growth- and plasticity-associated protein GAP-43 in the rat auditory brainstem.
AU  - Michler, Steffen A.
AU  - Illing, Robert-Benjamin
T2  - The Journal of comparative neurology
AB  - We explored the consequences of unilateral acoustic trauma to intracochlear and central nervous system structures in rats. An acoustic trauma, induced by  applying click stimuli of 130 dB (sound pressure level; SPL) for 30 minutes,  resulted in an instant and permanent threshold shift of 95.92 +/- 1.08 dB (SEM)  in the affected ear. We observed, as a consequence, a structural deterioration of  the organ of Corti. Deprivation-dependent changes of neurons of the auditory  brainstem were determined using antibodies against neurofilament and the  growth-associated protein GAP-43 and compared with those following cochleotomy,  studied earlier. By 231 days posttrauma, spiral ganglion cell bodies and their  processes were almost entirely lost from all cochlear regions with destroyed  organ of Corti. In the lateral superior olive (LSO) ipsilateral to the trauma,  cell bodies of lateral olivocochlear neurons turned transiently GAP-43 positive  within the first 1.5 years posttrauma. The time course of emergence and  disappearance of this population of neurons was similar to that found after  cochleotomy. Additionally, after noise trauma, principal cells in contralateral  LSO and in medial superior olive (MSO) on both sides of the brainstem developed  an expression of GAP-43 that began 3 and 16 days posttrauma, respectively, and  lasted for at least 1 year. Such cells were rarely observed after cochleotomy. An  unequivocal rise in GAP-43 immunoreactivity was also found in the neuropil of the  inferior colliculus and the ventral cochlear nucleus, both preferentially on the  acoustically damaged side. We conclude that the degree and specific cause of  sudden unilateral deafness entail specific patterns of plasticity responses in  the auditory brainstem, possibly to prevent the neural network dedicated to  locate sounds in the environment from delivering erroneous signals centralward.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of repeated and prolonged vaginal distension on the leak-point pressure (LPP) and urethral anatomy in the female rat, as  prolonged vaginal distension has been clinically correlated with signs of stress  urinary incontinence (SUI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty female rats were placed  into one of five groups; four groups underwent one of four vaginal distension  protocols using a modified 10 F Foley catheter, i.e. prolonged (1 h), brief (0.5  h), intermittent (cycling inflated/deflated for 0.5 h) or sham distension. All  animals had a suprapubic bladder catheter implanted 2 days after and were  assessed urodynamically 4 days after vaginal distension. The fifth group of rats  acted as controls and did not undergo vaginal distension, but did have a  suprapubic bladder catheter placed and urodynamics assessed. To measure LPP the  rats were anaesthetized with urethane, placed supine and the bladder filled with  saline (5 mL/h) while bladder pressure was measured via the bladder catheter.  LPPs were measured three times in each animal by manually increasing the  abdominal pressure until leakage at the urethral meatus, when the external  abdominal pressure was rapidly released. Peak bladder pressure was taken as the  LPP and a mean value calculated for each animal. Immediately after measuring LPP  the urethra was removed and processed routinely for histology (5 micro m  sections, stained with haematoxylin/eosin and trichrome). The means (sem) were  compared using a Kruskal-Wallis one-way anova on ranks, followed by a Dunn's  test, with P < 0.05 indicating a significant difference. RESULTS: Both LPP and  the external increase in abdominal pressure were significantly lower after  prolonged distension, at 31.4 (1.7) and 19.8 (1.2) cmH2O, than in the sham group,  at 41.1 (3.2) and 32.0 (4.7) cmH2O, respectively. There were no significant  differences in LPP or in the increase in abdominal pressure between the brief,  intermittent and sham groups. Qualitative histology showed that prolonged  distension resulted in extensive disruption and marked thinning of urethral  skeletal muscle fibres. Brief and intermittent distension showed mild and focal  disruptions, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: As observed clinically, prolonged vaginal  distension results in a lower LPP, greater anatomical injury and increased  severity of SUI. These results suggest that ischaemia is important in the  development of SUI after prolonged vaginal distension.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sevoflurane protects the heart against reperfusion injury even after cardioplegic arrest. This protection may depend on the cardioplegic solution.  Therefore, we investigated the effect of sevoflurane on myocardial reperfusion  injury after cardioplegic arrest with University of Wisconsin solution (UW),  Bretschneider's cardioplegia (HTK), and St Thomas' Hospital solution (STH).  METHODS: We used an isolated rat heart model where heart rate, ventricular  volume, and perfusion pressure were constant. The hearts underwent 30 min of  normothermic ischaemia followed by 60 min of reperfusion. Seven groups were  studied (n = 9 each). Three groups received 7 degrees C cold cardioplegic  solutions (UW, HTK, STH) during the first 2 min of ischaemia at a flow of 2 ml  min-1. In three groups (UW + Sevo, HTK + Sevo, STH + Sevo), sevoflurane was  additionally added to the perfusion medium (membrane oxygenator) at 3.8% (1.5  MAC) during the first 15 min of reperfusion after cardioplegic arrest. Nine  hearts served as untreated control group (control). We measured left ventricular  developed pressure (LVDP) and infarct size. RESULTS: LVDP was similar in all  groups during baseline (130 (SEM 2) mm Hg). HTK and STH improved recovery of LVDP  during reperfusion from 5 (1) (control) to 67 (7) (HTK) and 52 (8) mm Hg (STH,  both P < 0.05), while UW had no effect on myocardial function (7 (2) mm Hg). In  the sevoflurane-treated groups, LVDP at the end of the experiments was not  significantly different from the respective group without anaesthetic treatment  (UW + Sevo 11 (2); HTK + Sevo 83 (8); STH + Sevo 64 (8) mm Hg; P = ns). Infarct  size was reduced in the HTK and STH groups (HTK 20 (4); STH 17 (3)%; P < 0.05)  compared with controls (39 (5)%; P < 0.05), but not in the UW group (52 (4)%).  Compared with cardioplegia alone, sevoflurane treatment during reperfusion  reduced infarct size (UW + Sevo 31 (4); HTK + Sevo 8 (1); STH + Sevo 4 (1)%; P <  0.05). CONCLUSION: We conclude, that the protection against reperfusion injury  offered by sevoflurane is independent of the three cardioplegic solutions used.

AB  - PURPOSE: High levels of glutamate can be toxic to retinal ganglion cells. Effective buffering of extracellular glutamate by retinal glutamate transporters  is therefore important. This study was conducted to investigate whether glutamate  transporter changes occur with two models of optic nerve injury in the rat.  METHODS: Glaucoma was induced in one eye of 35 adult Wistar rats by translimbal  diode laser treatment to the trabecular meshwork. Twenty-five more rats underwent  unilateral optic nerve transection. Two glutamate transporters, GLAST (EAAT-1)  and GLT-1 (EAAT-2), were studied by immunohistochemistry and quantitative Western  blot analysis. Treated and control eyes were compared 3 days and 1, 4, and 6  weeks after injury. Optic nerve damage was assessed semiquantitatively in  epoxy-embedded optic nerve cross sections. RESULTS: Trabecular laser treatment  resulted in moderate intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation in all animals. After 1  to 6 weeks of experimental glaucoma, all treated eyes had significant optic nerve  damage. Glutamate transporter changes were not detected by immunohistochemistry.  Western blot analysis demonstrated significantly reduced GLT-1 in glaucomatous  eyes compared with control eyes at 3 days (29.3% +/- 6.7%, P = 0.01), 1 week  (55.5% +/- 13.6%, P = 0.02), 4 weeks (27.2% +/- 10.1%, P = 0.05), and 6 weeks  (38.1% +/- 7.9%, P = 0.01; mean reduction +/- SEM, paired t-tests, n = 5 animals  per group, four duplicate Western blot analyses per eye). The magnitude of the  reduction in GLT-1 correlated significantly with mean IOP in the glaucomatous eye  (r(2) = 0.31, P = 0.01, linear regression). GLAST was significantly reduced  (33.8% +/- 8.1%, mean +/- SEM) after 4 weeks of elevated IOP (P = 0.01, paired  t-test, n = 5 animals per group). In contrast to glaucoma, optic nerve  transection resulted in an increase in GLT-1 compared with the control eye (P =  0.01, paired t-test, n = 15 animals). There was no significant change in GLAST  after transection. CONCLUSIONS: GLT-1 and GLAST were significantly reduced in an  experimental rat glaucoma model, a response that was not found after optic nerve  transection. Reductions in GLT-1 and GLAST may increase the potential for  glutamate-induced injury to RGC in glaucoma.

T2  - Transplant international : official journal of the European Society for Organ Transplantation
AB  - Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is a new immunosuppressive agent which has been used successfully after kidney and heart transplantation. Experience with MMF after  liver transplantation is still limited. In particular, there is no information  about influence on ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). Therefore, the aim of this  investigation was to assess the effects of mycophenolic acid (MPA), the  pharmacologically active metabolite of MMF, in the cold-preserved or normal rat  liver. Livers of male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to cold ischemia in  University of Wisconsin (UW) solution (24 h, 4 degrees C) and reperfused for 2 h  in the absence or presence of MPA (100 microg/ml, n=5-6 each). Another group  received MPA pretreatment for 20 min prior to ischemia ( n=7). In further  experiments, livers were perfused with a bile salt-free Krebs-Henseleit buffer in  a continuous fashion (controls, n=5). MPA was infused from 20-40 min after  starting perfusion in therapeutic concentrations (5 microg/ml, 10 microg/ml, 40  microg/ml, and 100 microg/ml; n=3-6 each). There was no significant influence of  MPA on portal pressure nor on postischemic efflux rates of LDH. MPA pretreatment  resulted in a significant improvement of bile flow during reperfusion  (0.32+/-0.05 microl/min x g liver) compared with controls (0.17+/-0.04 microl/min  x g liver, mean+/-SEM). In contrast, postischemic bile flow was not influenced by  continuous administration of MPA during the reperfusion period only (0.18+/-0.07  microl/min x g liver). In continuously perfused livers, MPA increased bile  salt-independent bile flow (1.00+/-0.06 microl/min x g liver) in a dose-dependent  manner, reaching half-maximal effects around 5 microg/ml (1.66+/-0.15 microl/min  x g liver) and maximal effects at 40 microg/ml (2.61+/-0.28 microl/min x g  liver). In conclusion, neither preischemic nor postischemic administration of MPA  influences IRI to hepatocytes significantly after hypothermic liver preservation  in UW solution. In contrast to other immunosuppressive agents, MPA exhibits  strong choleretic effects, which are related to a stimulation of bile  salt-independent bile formation.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate the feasibility and efficacy of bronchoscopic surfactant administration in a noncontrolled multicentre study in  five university centres. A total number of 27 patients, suffering from severe  acute respiratory distress syndrome (mean+/-SEM lung injury score: 3.15+/-0.06)  and septic shock (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II  score at study entry 33.2+/-1.3, lactate 4.3+/-0.6 mmol x L(-1)) were studied.  The patients were ventilated with a mean tidal volume of 11.0+/-0.5 mL x kg(-1)  body weight (bw), either volume or pressure controlled, with 16.3+/-2.8 cmH2O  positive end-expiratory pressure, for an average of 3.5+/-0.3 days at study  entry. A natural bovine surfactant extract (300 mg x kg(-1) bw Alveofact; mean  total volume 378 mL) was delivered in divided doses to each segment of the lungs  via flexible bronchoscope within approximately 45 min. No untoward effects on gas  exchange, lung mechanics and haemodynamics were noted during the procedure of  surfactant administration. Within 12 h the oxygen tension in arterial  blood/inspiratory oxygen fraction increased from a mean of 109+/-8 mmHg to  210+/-20 mmHg (p<0.001). In seven patients, in whom gas exchange again  deteriorated with further progression of the disease, a second surfactant dose of  200 mg x kg(-1) was administered 18-24 h after the first application, again  improving arterial oxygenation. A total of 15 patients survived the 28-day study  period (mortality rate 44.4%, compared to a calculated risk of death for the  given APACHE II scores of 74.0+/-3.5%), with all causes of death being  nonrespiratory. The bronchoscopic application of a high dose of natural  surfactant in patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and septic  shock is both feasible and safe, resulting in a pronounced improvement in gas  exchange.

AB  - PURPOSE: We evaluated the efficacy of a cross-linked matrix tissue sealant compared with oxidized cellulose and electrocautery in an acute renal injury  model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats underwent partial nephrectomy  after intravenous heparin anticoagulation. The cut surface received 1 of 4  therapies, namely no treatment, cross-linked matrix tissue sealant,  electrocautery or Surgicel (Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick, New Jersey)  oxidized cellulose. Blood pressure was continually monitored, survival time was  determined and total blood loss was quantified in each animal. RESULTS: Animals  that received no treatment, electrocautery or oxidized cellulose died within 13  minutes of injury with a decline in blood pressure to 0 mm. Hg. In cross-linked  matrix treated rats hemostasis was immediate, resulting in no blood loss after  cross-linked matrix application. Mean arterial pressure +/- SEM was maintained at  136 +/- 6 mm. Hg. All cross-linked matrix treated animals survived. CONCLUSIONS:  Cross-linked matrix tissue sealant provided immediate hemostasis and protection  from a decline in blood pressure after renal trauma in heparinized rats.  Cross-linked matrix tissue sealant may benefit patients with severe renal  injuries. In the future cross-linked matrix may be useful for long-term partial  nephrectomy repair.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Antiangiogenic cancer therapy is likely to be administered long term for sustained suppression of tumor outgrowth. Surgeons will encounter more  patients undergoing such therapy. Therefore, it is essential to know the effects  of antiangiogenic agents on physiological angiogenesis, as occurs during the  healing of colonic anastomoses. METHODS: Angiostatin was generated from human  plasma and administered continuously. In 38 mice, the right colon was anastomosed  after transection: group 1 (n = 13), anastomotic healing under angiostatin  treatment from surgery until death (day 7); group 2 (n = 13), phosphate-buffered  saline controls. For healing on discontinuation of treatment, group 3 (n = 6)  received angiostatin treatment preceding surgery during 4 days; group 4 (n = 6)  included controls. On day 7, all mice were inspected for signs of anastomotic  leakage. Bursting pressure measurements were performed to test anastomotic  strength. Neovascularization was assessed semiquantitatively by  immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Mice treated with angiostatin postoperatively  showed significantly more signs of leakage, more adhesions, and peritonitis. One  mouse died on day 5. Five mice had paralytical ileus. The bursting pressure in  group 1 was 135 +/- 20 mm Hg, versus 175 +/- 12 mm Hg in group 2 (mean +/- SEM).  Significantly fewer new vessels were found surrounding the anastomosis in the  treated group (6.6 +/-.9) versus controls (16 +/- 1.6). All controls, as well as  those animals treated with angiostatin only until surgery (group 3), displayed  normal healing and showed no signs of peritonitis or ileus. CONCLUSIONS:  Angiostatin impairs anastomotic healing in mice. However, on discontinuation of  antiangiogenic therapy, normal anastomotic healing is promptly restored.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Cardiac ischemia-reperfusion activates Na(+)/H(+) exchange; excess Na(+) and the resulting Ca(2+) overload, through reverse Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange,  cause cellular injury and cardiac dysfunction. We postulated that inhibiting the  Na(+)/H(+) isoform-1 exchanger would add to the protection of hearts after  long-term cold storage in acidic cardioplegic solution. METHODS: Guinea pig  hearts were isolated and perfused at 37 degrees C with Krebs-Ringer's solution  (KRS) and then switched to an acidic St. Thomas solution (STS) at 25 degrees C.  Perfusion was stopped at 10 degrees C, and hearts were stored for 6 hours in STS  at 3.4 degrees C. On reperfusion to 25 degrees C, hearts were perfused with KRS  for 60 minutes. Hearts were divided into 4 groups: sham control (SHAM); eniporide  (EPR, EMD96785) IV, 1 mg/kg given IV over 15 minutes before heart isolation; EPR  intracoronary, 1 micromol/liter in STS given intracoronary after heart isolation;  and EPR IV and intracoronary. RESULTS: Values at 60 minutes reperfusion (the  percentage of control [100%] before cold storage) are given, respectively, for  EPR IV, EPR intracoronary, and EPR IV and intracoronary vs drug-free SHAM (SEM,  *p < 0.05 vs SHAM): 72% +/- 3%*, 65% +/- 3%*, and 81% +/- 2%* vs 55% +/- 3% for  left ventricular pressure; 94% +/- 3%*, 96% +/- 5%*, and 102% +/- 2%* vs 81% +/-  3% for coronary flow; 60% +/- 2%, 58% +/- 3%, and 74%* +/- 3% vs 58% +/- 4% for  cardiac efficiency; 106% +/- 2%*, 108% +/- 3%*, and 107% +/- 2%* vs 116% +/- 4%  for percentage of O(2) extraction. Infarct size as percentage of ventricular  weight was 20% +/- 3%*, 31% +/- 3%, and 6% +/- 2%* vs 35% +/- 3% (SHAM) after 60  minutes of reperfusion. CONCLUSIONS: Na(+)/H(+) isoform-1 exchanger inhibition,  particularly if given IV before storage and intracoronary during cooling and  rewarming, adds to the protection of cardioplegic solutions.

AB  - A combination of exogenous surfactant and partial liquid ventilation (PLV) with perfluorocarbons should enhance gas exchange, improve respiratory mechanics and  reduce tissue damage of the lung in acute lung injury (ALI). We used a small dose  of exogenous surfactant with and without PLV in an experimental model of ALI and  studied the effects on gas exchange, haemodynamics, lung mechanics, and lung  pathology. ALI was induced by repeated lavages (PaO2/FIO2 less than 13 kPa) in 24  anaesthesized, tracheotomized and mechanically ventilated (FIO2 1.0) juvenile  pigs. They were treated randomly with either a single intratracheal dose of  surfactant (50 mg kg(-1), Curosurf, Serono AG, München, Germany) (SURF-group,  n=8), a single intratracheal dose of surfactant (50 mg kg(-1), Curosurf) followed  by PLV with 30 ml kg(-1) of perfluorocarbon (PF 5080, 3M, Germany)  (SURF-PLV-group, n=8) or no further intervention (controls, n=8). Pulmonary gas  exchange, respiratory mechanics, and haemodynamics were measured hourly for a 6 h  period. In the SURF-group, the intrapulmonary right-to-left shunt (QS/QT)  decreased significantly from mean 51 (SEM 5)% after lavage to 12 (2)%, and PaO2  increased significantly from 8.1 (0.7) to 61.2 (4.7) kPa compared with controls  and compared with the SURF-PLV-group (P<0.05). In the SURF-PLV-group, QS/QT  decreased significantly from 54 (3)% after induction of ALI to 26 (3)% and PaO2  increased significantly from 7.2 (0.5) to 30.8 (5.0) kPa compared with controls  (P<0.05). Static compliance of the respiratory system (C(RS)), significantly  improved in the SURF-PLV-group compared with controls (P<0.05). Upon histological  examination, the SURF-group revealed the lowest total injury score compared with  controls and the SURF-PLV-group (P<0.05). We conclude that in this experimental  model of ALI, treatment with a small dose of exogenous surfactant improves  pulmonary gas exchange and reduces the lung injury more effectively than the  combined treatment of a small dose of exogenous surfactant and PLV.

TI  - Effects of resveratrol, a flavinoid found in red wine, on infarct size in an experimental model of ischemia/reperfusion.
AU  - Hale, S. L.
AU  - Kloner, R. A.
T2  - Journal of studies on alcohol
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Resveratrol is a potent anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant flavinoid found in red wine. Resveratrol has been shown to improve ventricular function and  decrease lactic dehydrogenase release after ischemia in rats. The aim of this  study was to test whether resveratrol could provide direct cardioprotection to  myocytes during acute myocardial infarction. METHOD: Anesthetized, open-chest  rabbits (N= 24) were subjected to 30 minute coronary artery occlusion followed by  3 hr reperfusion. Before the onset of ischemia (15 minutes), the rabbits were  randomly assigned (n = 8 in each group) to either high-dose (1.5 mg/kg)  resveratrol, low-dose (0.15 mg/kg) resveratrol or ethanol vehicle, and the  effects on infarct size and regional myocardial blood flow (RMBF) were tested.  RESULTS: Hemodynamic parameters and size of ischemic risk region (29% to 35% of  the left ventricle) were similar in all groups. Infarct size, expressed as a mean  (SEM) percentage of the risk region, was 46% (5%) of the risk region in controls,  46% (7%) in the low-dose group and 54% (3%) in the high-dose group (p = .53).  Thus, treatment with resveratrol had no effect on infarct size at either dose.  There were no differences in RMBF in the risk zone or in nonischemic tissue,  during either occlusion or reperfusion. CONCLUSIONS: In this intact model of  ischemia and reperfusion, resveratrol fails to provide cardioprotection. The  mechanism of other beneficial effects (e.g., improvement of function) that are  observed with resveratrol probably do not result from increased RMBF or a  reduction in myocardial necrosis.

AU  - Wahn, Hans
T2  - Chest
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: Neutrophils are involved in acute lung injury during ARDS via several mechanisms. This study focuses on neutrophil-derived oxidative stress.  Hypochlorite is a major neutrophil-derived oxidant. This study characterizes  hypochlorite-induced acute changes in pulmonary circulation and the involvement  of tissue lipid peroxidation (LPO) and reduced glutathione (rGSH) depletion.  METHODS: Hypochlorite (500, 1,000, and 2,000 nmol/min) or buffer (control) were  infused into isolated rabbit lungs. Pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), capillary  filtration coefficient (Kf,c) [10(4)/mL/s/cm H(2)O/g], and lung weight were  measured. Experiments were terminated after 105 min or when fluid retention was >  50 g. Lung tissue was frozen immediately after termination of the experiments and  analyzed for LPO products and rGSH (nanomoles per milligram of protein). RESULTS:  Baseline PAP and Kf,c values averaged from 6.1 to 6.5 mm Hg and from 0.97 to  1.23, respectively, in all groups. Hypochlorite infusion of 500, 1,000, and 2,000  nmol/min (n = 5 to 7 per group) evoked an increase (mean +/- SEM) in maximum PAP  (PAPmax) [12.9 +/- 2.1, 14.3 +/- 1.7, and 13.3 +/- 2.2 mm Hg], in maximum Kf,c  (Kf,cmax) [1.9 +/- 1.2, 6.34 +/- 1.2, and >10.0], and in tissue LPO products (1.7  +/- 0.06, 2.1 +/- 0.06, and 2.3 +/- 0.11 vs 1.4 +/- 0.04 in controls), and a  decrease in tissue rGSH (73.4 +/- 8.7, 43.0 +/- 9.6, and 50.4 +/- 7.2 vs 139 +/-  12.6 in controls). Parameters of lung injury (PAPmax and Kf,cmax) of each single  experiment were closely correlated with tissue rGSH but did not correlate with  tissue LPO products. All changes are significant (p < 0.05) vs control.  CONCLUSION: The neutrophil-specific oxidant hypochlorite induces acute lung  injury, rGSH depletion, and LPO in isolated rabbit lungs. The lung injury  correlates with rGSH depletion, suggesting an important mechanistic role in  hypochlorite-induced acute lung injury.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess cardiopulmonary function in rats exposed to pulsed ultrasound using superthreshold exposure conditions known to produce significant  lung hemorrhage. METHODS: In 1 group of 9 anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats, 5  foci of ultrasound-induced hemorrhage were produced in the left lung of each rat.  In a second group of 6 rats, 5 foci of ultrasound-induced hemorrhage were  produced in the left and right lungs of each rat. Each lesion was induced using  superthreshold pulsed ultrasound exposure conditions (3.1-MHz center frequency,  1.7-kHz pulse repetition frequency, 1.3-micro-second pulse duration, 60-second  exposure duration, 39-MPa in situ peak compressional pressure, and 17-MPa in situ  peak rarefactional pressure). After exposure, the lungs were fixed in formalin  and assessed histologically. The total lesion volume was calculated for each  lesion in each lung lobe. Measurements of cardiopulmonary function included  assessment of pulsatile arterial pressure, heart rate, end-tidal carbon dioxide,  respiratory rate, and arterial blood gases (PCO2 and PO2). Functional data were  quantified before (baseline) and 30 minutes after exposure to ultrasound.  RESULTS: In the 9 rats that had lesions in only the left lung, the mean (SEM)  lesion volume was 97 (13) mm3 and represented about 3.4% of the total lung  volume. In the 6 rats that had lesions in both the left and right lungs, the  left, right, and total mean lesion volumes, respectively, were 102 (16), 114  (11), and 216 (18) mm3 and represented about 3.7%, 4.2%, and 7.9% of the total  lung volume. There were no statistically significant differences in  cardiopulmonary measurements between baseline values and values obtained after  exposure to ultrasound in the 9 rats exposed on the left lung only. The 6 rats  exposed bilaterally had statistically significant differences in arterial  pressure (134 +/- 4 versus 113 +/- 9 mm Hg; P= .047) and arterial PO2 (70 +/- 5  versus 58 +/- 4 mm Hg; P = .024) between baseline values and values obtained  after exposure to ultrasound. CONCLUSIONS: The severity of ultrasound-induced  lesions produced in 1 lung did not affect measurements of cardiopulmonary  function because of the functional respiratory reserve in the unexposed lung.  However, when both the left and right lungs had ultrasound-induced lesions, the  functional respiratory reserve was decreased to a point at which rats were unable  to maintain systemic arterial pressure or resting levels of arterial PO2.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Stretta device (Curon Medical, Sunnyvale, CA) is a balloon-tipped four-needle catheter that delivers radiofrequency (RF) energy to the smooth  muscle of the gastroesophageal junction. It can be used for the endoscopic  treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data  prospectively collected on the first 25 consecutive patients undergoing the  Stretta procedure at Vanderbilt University Medical Center between August 2000 and  March 2001 are reported. Patient evaluation included esophageal manometry,  ambulatory 24-hour pH testing, a standard GERD-specific quality-of-life survey  (QOLRAD), a general quality-of-life survey (SF12), and endoscopy. Stretta surgery  was performed following a standardized protocol. Thermocouple-controlled RF  energy was delivered to the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) after endoscopic  location of the z-line. Patients were followed up 3 months after endoscopic  treatment. Results are presented as mean +/- SEM. RESULTS: Prior to treatment,  patients had a mean DeMeester score of 31.0+/-11.4, an LES pressure of 24+/-2 mm  Hg, and normal esophageal peristalsis. Of the 25 outpatient procedures, 19 were  done under conscious sedation and 6 under general anesthesia. There was a small  learning curve (76+/-8 min for the first three procedures; 50+/-2 min for the  subsequent 22). The mild to moderate pain during the first 24 postoperative hours  was controlled with over-the-counter medication. Two complications were noted:  one patient presented with ulcerative esophagitis and gastroparesis 10 days after  the Stretta treatment, and one patient developed pancreatitis on postoperative  day 27, which was probably unrelated to the Stretta procedure. Eight of the  thirteen patients (62%) available for 3-month follow-up were off all  antisecretory medication. The other five patients were still taking medications  but had been able to reduce the amount considerably. The average daily dose of  proton pump inhibitors was 43.0+/-5.0 mg/preoperatively and 6.4+/-2.2 mg/3 months  postoperatively (P < 0.001). Other classes of GERD treatment such as  metoclopramide had been completely abandoned. In all patients, QOLRAD scores  improved (3.5+/-0.4 to 5.5+/-0.5; P < 0.001) as did SF12 physical (23.7+/-3.0 to  31.0+/-3.4; P < 0.008) and mental (40.5+/-2.9 to 47.7+/-3.2, P < 0.017) scores.  All patients would undergo a Stretta procedure again except one 78-year-old man  with progressive Alzheimer's disease. CONCLUSION: The Stretta procedure is a  promising new modality in the management of GERD. It can be safely performed in  one short session with gastroesophageal endoscopy under conscious sedation in an  outpatient setting. It improves GERD symptoms and quality-of-life scores in  patients at 3 months and eliminates or significantly reduces the need for  antisecretory drugs.

AB  - Ischaemic preconditioning can protect the myocardium against ischaemic injury by opening of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channel.  Isoflurane is also thought to open this channel. The present investigation tested  the hypothesis that pre-ischaemic treatment with isoflurane mimics ischaemic  preconditioning (producing chemical preconditioning) and thereby protects the  myocardium against ischaemic injury in an isolated rat heart model. Control  hearts underwent 30 min of global no-flow ischaemia followed by 60 min of  reperfusion. The hearts of the preconditioning group underwent two 5 min periods  of no-flow ischaemia interspersed with 5 min of reperfusion before the sustained  ischaemia. In three additional groups, hearts were subjected to 15 min of 1.5  minimal alveolar concentration (MAC) of isoflurane (ISO-1), 15 min 3 MAC (ISO-2)  or 25 min 1.5 MAC (ISO-3) of isoflurane followed by 5 min washout before the  global ischaemia. Left ventricular (LV) developed pressure and creatine kinase  release were measured as variables of myocardial performance and cellular injury,  respectively. Recovery of LV developed pressure was improved after ischaemic  preconditioning [after 60 min reperfusion, mean 63 (SEM 6)% of baseline] compared  with the control group [18 (4)% P<0.01] but not by isoflurane, independently of  concentration or duration of administration [ISO-1, 17 (2)%, P=0.99 vs control;  ISO-2, 12 (3)%, P=0.64; ISO-3, 4 (1)%, P=0.06]. Total creatine kinase release  over 1 h of reperfusion was not significantly different between control [251 (36)  U g(-1) dry weight] and all isoflurane groups [ISO-1, 346 (24) U g(-1), P=0.30;  ISO-2, 313 (33) U g(-1), P=0.73; ISO-3, 407 (40) U g(-1), P=0.03]. These results  indicate that pre-ischaemic administration of isoflurane does not cause  anaesthetic-induced preconditioning in the isolated rat heart.

AB  - The local anaesthetic lidocaine protects the myocardium in ischaemia-reperfusion situations. It is not known if this is the consequence of an anti-ischaemic  effect or an effect on reperfusion injury. Therefore, we investigated the effect  of two concentrations of lidocaine on myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion injury and  on reperfusion injury alone. We used an isolated rat heart model where heart  rate, ventricular volume and coronary flow were kept constant. Hearts underwent  45 min of low-flow ischaemia followed by 90 min reperfusion. Two groups received  lidocaine 1.7 or 17 microg ml(-1) starting 5 min before the onset of reperfusion.  In two additional groups, lidocaine infusion started 5 min before low-flow  ischaemia. In all groups, lidocaine administration was stopped after 15 min of  reperfusion. One group served as an untreated control (n=11 in each group). Left  ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) and total creatine kinase release (CKR)  were measured. Lidocaine administration during ischaemia and reperfusion led to  an improved recovery of LVDP during reperfusion (1.7 microg ml(-1), 54 (SEM 10)  mm Hg; 17 microg ml(-1), 71 (9) mm Hg at 30 min of reperfusion; both  significantly different from control (21 (4) mm Hg) (P<0.05)) and a reduced CKR  (1.7 microg ml(-1), 79 (13) IU; 17 microg ml(-1), 52 (8) IU at 30 min of  reperfusion; both significantly different from control (130 (8) IU (P<0.05)).  Lidocaine given during early reperfusion only, affected neither LVDP during  reperfusion (1.7 microg ml(-1), 19 (6) mm Hg (P=1.0); 17 microg ml(-1), 36 (8) mm  Hg (P=0.46)) nor CKR (156 (21) IU (P=0.50) and 106 (14) IU (P=0.57)). We conclude  that lidocaine protects the myocardium against ischaemic but not against  reperfusion injury in the isolated rat heart.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adenosine (Ado) triggers numerous protective mechanisms in the heart that may attenuate ischemia-reperfusion injury in cardiac grafts. We aimed to  establish whether sustained increase in endogenous Ado production by the combined  application of Ado metabolism inhibitors and nucleotide precursors attenuates  reperfusion injury in transplanted hearts. METHODS AND RESULTS: Rat hearts were  collected after the infusion of St Thomas' Hospital cardioplegic solution, stored  at 4 degrees C for 4 hours, and heterotopically transplanted into the abdomen of  recipient rats. A solution containing Ado deaminase inhibitor  erythro-9(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine, Ado kinase inhibitor 5'-aminoadenosine, and  nucleotide precursors adenine and ribose was administered at the time of  reperfusion in the treated group, whereas saline was administered to control  animals. After 1 or 24 hours, mechanical function of the transplanted hearts was  evaluated in an ex vivo perfusion system followed by the determination of  myocardial ATP with related metabolites and measurement of the activity of  neutrophil-specific enzyme myeloperoxidase in cardiac homogenates. After 24 hours  of reperfusion, maximum left ventricular developed pressure increased from  87.0+/-6.8 mm Hg (mean+/-SEM) in controls to 118.1+/-8.2 mm Hg in the treated  group (P<0.05), ATP increased from 11.0+/-0.8 micromol/g dry wt in controls to  15.1+/-1.2 micromol/g dry wt in the treated group (P<0.01), and myeloperoxidase  activity decreased from 2.23+/-0.60 U/g wet wt in controls to 0.58+/-0.12 U/g wet  wt in the treated group (P<0.001). No differences in cardiac function, ATP, or  myeloperoxidase activity were observed between the treated group and controls  after 1 hour of reperfusion. CONCLUSIONS: The administration of Ado metabolism  inhibitors with nucleotide precursors causes a sustained increase in endogenous  Ado production and exerts a potent protective effect against reperfusion injury  in transplanted hearts. Improved cardiac function and elevated ATP concentration  were accompanied by complete amelioration of neutrophil infiltration in treated  hearts, suggesting that reduction in postischemic inflammation could be an  important mechanism of this protective effect.

AB  - To investigate whether respiratory acidosis modulates ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), we perfused (constant flow) 21 isolated sets of normal rabbit  lungs, ventilated them for 20 min (pressure controlled ventilation [PCV] = 15 cm  H(2)O) (Baseline) with an inspired CO(2) fraction adjusted for the partial  pressure of CO(2) in the perfusate (PCO(2) approximately equal to 40 mm Hg), and  then randomized them into three groups. Group A (control: n = 7) was ventilated  with PCV = 15 cm H(2)O for three consecutive 20-min periods (T1, T2, T3). In  Group B (high PCV/normocapnia; n = 7), PCV was given at 20 (T1), 25 (T2), and 30  (T3) cm H(2)O. The targeted PCO(2) was 40 mm Hg in Groups A and B. Group C (high  PCV/hypercapnia; n = 7) was ventilated in the same way as Group B, but the  targeted PCO(2) was approximately equal to 70 to 100 mm Hg. The changes (from  Baseline to T3) in weight gain (Delta WG: g) and in the ultrafiltration  coefficient (Delta K(f) = gr/min/ cm H(2)O/100g) and the protein and hemoglobin  concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were used to assess injury.  Group B experienced a significantly greater Delta WG (14.85 +/- 5.49 [mean +/-  SEM] g) and Delta K(f) (1.40 +/- 0.49 g/min/cm H(2)O/100 g) than did either Group  A (Delta WG = 0.70 +/- 0.43; Delta K(f) = 0.01 +/- 0.03) or Group C (Delta WG =  5.27 +/- 2.03 g; Delta K(f) = 0.25 +/- 0.12 g/min/cm H(2)O/ 100 g). BALF protein  and hemoglobin concentrations (g/L) were higher in Group B (11.98 +/- 3.78 g/L  and 1.82 +/- 0.40 g/L, respectively) than in Group A (2.92 +/- 0.75 g/L and 0.38  +/- 0.15 g/L) or Group C (5.71 +/- 1.88 g/L and 1.19 +/- 0.32 g/L). We conclude  that respiratory acidosis decreases the severity of VILI in this model.

AB  - PURPOSE: During general anesthesia, nitrous oxide (N2O) diffuses rapidly into the air-filled laryngeal mask airway (LMA) cuff, increasing intracuff pressure. There  is no clear correlation between LMA intracuff pressure and pressure on the  pharynx. We have studied the effects of high LMA intracuff pressures secondary to  N2O on the pharyngeal mucosa of dogs. METHODS: Sixteen mongrel dogs were randomly  allocated to two groups: G1 (intracuff volume, 30 mL; n=8) breathed a mixture of  O2 (l L x min(-1)) and air (l L x min(-1)) and G2 (intracuff volume, 30 mL; n=8)  a mixture of O2 (l L x min(-1)) and N2O (l L x min(-1)). Anesthesia was induced  and maintained with pentobarbitone. LMA cuff pressure was measured at zero  (control), 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after #4 LMA insertion. The dogs were  sacrificed, and biopsy specimens from seven predetermined areas of the pharynx in  contact with the LMA cuff were collected for light (LM) and scanning electron  microscopic (SEM) examination by a blinded observer. RESULTS: LMA intracuff  pressure decreased with time in G1 (P <0.001) and increased in G2 (P <0.001).  There was a significant difference between the groups (P <0.001). In both groups,  the LM study showed a normal epithelium covering the pharyngeal mucosa and mild  congestion in the subepithelial layer. There were no differences between the  groups (P >0.10) or among the areas sampled (P >0.05). In both groups, the SEM  study showed a normal pharyngeal mucosa with mild superficial desquamation. Few  specimens in G1 and G2 showed more intense epithelial desquamation. CONCLUSION:  High LMA intracuff pressures produced by N2O do not increase pharyngeal mucosal  injury in dogs.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It is not known whether preischemic exposure to anesthetic agents affects the amount of damage from transient focal ischemia that  occurs after cessation of the anesthetic. We compared the effect of prior  exposure to halothane or propofol on infarction size after transient middle  cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) induced in the awakening animal to test the  hypothesis that anesthetic type and exposure duration would independently affect  the amount of brain injury. METHODS: Male Wistar rats (weight, 200 to 300 g) were  anesthetized briefly with halothane for placement of hemodynamic instrumentation.  Twenty-four hours later, rats were treated with either a short (approximately 1  hour) or long (8 hours) duration of inhaled halothane (1% to 2%) or intravenous  propofol (10 mg/kg bolus, 30 mg/kg per hour infusion). Each cohort (n=8 per  group) was then subjected to 2-hour MCAO by the intraluminal suture technique.  All anesthesia was discontinued once MCAO was achieved. Infarct volume was  measured at 22 hours of reperfusion. In a second cohort, regional cerebral blood  flow (CBF) was measured ([(14)C]iodoantipyrine autoradiography) at end-occlusion  in short-duration halothane (n=5) or short-duration propofol (n=5) anesthesia  groups and in corresponding surgical shams (n=3 each). RESULTS: Pericranial  temperature, PaO(2), PaCO(2), and blood pressure were controlled and not  different among groups before or during occlusion. MCAO resulted in a similar  immediate reduction in laser-Doppler flow signal after discontinuation of  anesthesia in the awakening animals. Infarct volume was smaller in rats exposed  to short-duration halothane in cortex (87.5+/-16.6 mm(3)) (mean+/-SEM) and  caudoputamen (38.3+/-13.7 mm(3)) compared with rats exposed to short-duration  propofol (cortex, 177.5+/-16.9 mm(3); caudoputamen, 47.8+/-2.9 mm(3)). Infarct  volume was not different in long-duration halothane versus long-duration propofol  treatment. Absolute cortical or caudoputamen intraischemic CBF was not different  between short-duration halothane or short-duration propofol treatment.  CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that short-duration halothane exposure before  MCAO in the awakening animal attenuates infarction volume compared with propofol.  This protection by halothane is not mediated through preservation of  intraischemic CBF. Longer durations of halothane exposure may activate secondary  injury pathways, which negate the protective effects of short-term halothane  preischemic treatment.

AB  - We examined the role of endothelin in ischaemia/reperfusion injury in skeletal muscle, using the endothelin receptor antagonist Bosentan. In the rat hindlimb  tourniquet ischaemia model, one hindlimb was rendered ischaemic for 2 h at 36  degrees C, then blood flow was re-established for either 24 h to assess muscle  survival or 1.5 h for a study of capillary perfusion. In the first set of rats,  the gastrocnemius muscle was removed from the postischaemic limb and assessed for  viability histochemically using the nitro blue tetrazolium stain. Tissue water  content (a measure of oedema) and myeloperoxidase activity (a measure of  neutrophil accumulation) were also assessed in the ischaemic muscle, the  contralateral non-ischaemic muscle and the lungs. In the second set of rats, the  hind limb was infused with India ink after 2-h ischaemia and 1.5-h reperfusion  and the muscle was harvested, fixed and cleared. In control rats, muscle  viability was 17+/-2% (S.E.M.). In rats treated with Bosentan (10 mg/kg, i.p.) 30  min before release of the tourniquet, muscle viability (48+/-7%) was  significantly increased compared to the control group (P<0.01). Bosentan  treatment had no significant effect on tissue water content or myeloperoxidase  activity in the ischaemic muscle, the contralateral non-ischaemic muscle or the  lung. Immunoreactive endothelin levels in serum increased to a peak at 90 min of  reperfusion and returned to control levels by 24-h reperfusion. India ink studies  demonstrated a significantly increased functional capillary density in  postischaemic Bosentan-treated muscles compared with postischaemic control  muscles (P<0.05). These results suggest that endothelin plays an important role  in the necrosis which results from a period of ischaemia and reperfusion in  skeletal muscle, by mediating a decrease in postischaemic microvascular  perfusion.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: A lower inflection point, an upper inflection (or deflection) point, and respiratory system compliance can be estimated from an inspiratory  static pressure-volume (SPV) curve of the respiratory system. Such data are often  used to guide selection of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)/tidal volume  combinations. Dynamic pressure-volume (DPV) curves obtained during tidal  ventilation are effortlessly displayed on modern mechanical ventilator monitors  and bear a theoretical but unproven relationship to the more labor-intensive SPV  curves. OBJECTIVE: Attempting to relate the SPV and DPV curves, we assessed both  curves under a range of conditions in a canine oleic acid lung injury model.  METHODS: Five mongrel dogs were anesthetized, paralyzed, and monitored to assure  a stable preparation. Acute lung injury was induced by infusing oleic acid. SPV  curves were constructed by the super-syringe method. DPV curves were constructed  for a range of PEEP and inspiratory constant flow settings while ventilating at a  frequency of 15 breaths/min and tidal volume of 350 mL. Functional residual  capacity at PEEP = 0 cm H2O was measured by helium dilution. The change in lung  volume by PEEP at 8, 16, and 24 cm H2O was measured by respiratory inductance  plethysmography. RESULTS: The slope of the second portion of the DPV curve did  not parallel the corresponding slope of the SPV curve. The mean lower inflection  point of the SPV curve was 13.2 cm H2O, whereas the lower inflection point of the  DPV curve was related to the prevailing flow and PEEP settings. The absolute lung  volume during the DPV recordings exceeded (p < 0.05) that anticipated from the  SPV curves by (values are mean +/- SEM) 267 +/- 86 mL, 425 +/- 129 mL, and 494  +/- 129 mL at end expiration for PEEP = 8, 16, and 24 cm H2O, respectively.  CONCLUSIONS: The contours of the SPV curve are not reflected by those of the DPV  curve in this model of acute lung injury. Therefore, this study indicates that  DPV curve should not be used to guide the selection of PEEP/tidal volume  combinations. Furthermore, an increase in end-expiratory lung volume occurs  during tidal ventilation that is not reflected by the classical SPV curve,  suggesting a stable component of lung volume recruitment attributable to tidal  ventilation, independent of PEEP.

AB  - Pulmonary dysfunction leading to secondary hypoxia is a common complication of spinal cord injury (SCI). The purpose of this study was to clarify the behavioral  and histopathological consequences of posttraumatic hypoxia in an established  model of traumatic SCI. Forty-five female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly  assigned to one of four groups, including (1) laminectomy and normoxia (n = 10),  (2) laminectomy and hypoxia (n = 11), (3) NYU weight-drop and normoxia (n = 12),  and (4) NYU weight-drop and hypoxia (n = 11). For these studies, a moderate  injury was induced by adjusting the height of the weight drop (10 g) to 12.5 mm  above the exposed spinal cord (T10). Immediately after injury, PaO2 in the  hypoxic rats was kept between 30 and 35 mm Hg for 30 min. PaO2 in the normoxic  group was maintained over 100 mm Hg, while PaCO2 in all rats was maintained at  35-40 mm Hg. The behavior of the rats was checked every 7 days using the Basso,  Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor rating scale. Rats were sacrificed at 8  weeks for quantitative histopathological analysis of lesion areas. During the  hypoxic insults, the mean arterial blood pressure dropped in both sham control  and weight-drop rats (p < 0.01). At the end of the 8-week monitoring period, BBB  scores were 12.5 +/- 3.1 (mean +/- SEM) and 14.2 +/- 3.4 in the normoxic and  hypoxic traumatized rats, respectively. No significant difference between the  traumatized groups was documented with BBB monitoring. In contrast, the percent  of gray matter necrosis at the impact epicenter was significantly increased in  hypoxic versus normoxic SCI rats (p < 0.01). These data demonstrate that  posttraumatic hypoxia complicated by mild hypotension aggravates the  histopathological consequences of SCI and further emphasize the need to control  for secondary hypoxic insults after experimental and clinical SCI. Potential  explanations for the lack of a correlation between the behavioral and  histopathological findings are discussed.

AB  - Improved gas exchange has been observed during spontaneous breathing with airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) as compared with controlled mechanical  ventilation. This study was designed to determine whether use of APRV with  spontaneous breathing as a primary ventilatory support modality better prevents  deterioration of cardiopulmonary function than does initial controlled mechanical  ventilation in patients at risk for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).  Thirty patients with multiple trauma were randomly assigned to either breathe  spontaneously with APRV (APRV Group) (n = 15) or to receive pressure-controlled,  time-cycled mechanical ventilation (PCV) for 72 h followed by weaning with APRV  (PCV Group) (n = 15). Patients maintained spontaneous breathing during APRV with  continuous infusion of sufentanil and midazolam (Ramsay sedation score [RSS] of  3). Absence of spontaneous breathing (PCV Group) was induced with sufentanil and  midazolam (RSS of 5) and neuromuscular blockade. Primary use of APRV was  associated with increases (p < 0.05) in respiratory system compliance (CRS),  arterial oxygen tension (PaO2), cardiac index (CI), and oxygen delivery (DO2),  and with reductions (p < 0.05) in venous admixture (QVA/QT), and oxygen  extraction. In contrast, patients who received 72 h of PCV had lower CRS, PaO2,  CI, DO2, and Q VA/Q T values (p < 0.05) and required higher doses of sufentanil  (p < 0.05), midazolam (p < 0.05), noradrenalin (p < 0.05), and dobutamine (p <  0.05). CRS, PaO2), CI and DO2 were lowest (p < 0.05) and Q VA/Q T was highest (p  < 0.05) during PCV. Primary use of APRV was consistently associated with a  shorter duration of ventilatory support (APRV Group: 15 +/- 2 d [mean +/- SEM];  PCV Group: 21 +/- 2 d) (p < 0.05) and length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay  (APRV Group: 23 +/- 2 d; PCV Group: 30 +/- 2 d) (p < 0.05). These findings  indicate that maintaining spontaneous breathing during APRV requires less  sedation and improves cardiopulmonary function, presumably by recruiting  nonventilated lung units, requiring a shorter duration of ventilatory support and  ICU stay.

AB  - Blast injuries represent a problem for civilian and military populations. Primary thoracic blast injury causes a triad of bradycardia, hypotension and apnoea. The  objective of this study was to investigate the reflex nature of this response and  its modulation by vagotomy or administration of atropine. The study was conducted  on terminally anaesthetised (alphadolone/alphaxalone, 18-24 mg x kg x h(-1),  I.V.) male Wistar rats randomly allocated to the groups indicated below. Blast  injuries were produced with compressed air while sham blast involved the sound of  a blast only. Primary blast injury to the thorax resulted in a bradycardia  (measured as an increase in the interval between beats, or heart period (HP) to  489 +/- 37 ms from 133 +/- 3 ms with a latency of onset of 4.3 +/- 0.3 s, mean  +/- S.E.M.), hypotension (fall in mean arterial blood pressure (MBP) from 128.1  +/- 3.7 mmHg to 34.8 +/- 4.1 mmHg, latency of onset 2.0 +/- 0.1 s) and apnoea  lasting 28.3 +/- 2.3 s. Sham blast had no effect. The bradycardia and apnoea  following thoracic blast were abolished by cervical vagotomy while the  hypotension was attenuated. Atropine (0.3 mg x kg(-1), I.V.) caused a significant  reduction in the bradycardia (HP increasing from 124 +/- 3 ms to 142 +/- 4 ms)  but did not modulate either the hypotension or apnoea. It is concluded that a  reflex involving the vagus nerve mediates the bradycardia, apnoea and a component  of the hypotension associated with thoracic blast. The pattern of this response  is similar to effects that follow stimulation of the pulmonary afferent C-fibres.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We sought to evaluate the ability of type 5 phosphodiesterase (PDE5) inhibitors to augment the antithrombotic effects of inhaled nitric oxide (NO) in  a canine model of platelet-mediated coronary thrombosis after thrombolysis.  BACKGROUND: Type 5 phosphodiesterase inhibitors potentiate the ability of NO to  inhibit platelet aggregation in vitro by preventing platelet cyclic guanosine  monophosphate catabolism. We previously reported that breathing low  concentrations of NO gas attenuated, but did not prevent, cyclic flow reductions  (CFRs) in a canine model of coronary thrombosis after thrombolysis. METHODS:  Cyclic flow reductions were induced after creation of a left anterior descending  coronary artery stenosis, endothelial injury, thrombus formation and  thrombolysis. Dogs were either untreated or treated with inhaled NO (20 ppm by  volume), intravenous zaprinast, intravenous dipyridamole or the combination of  inhaled NO with either PDE5 inhibitor (n = 4 per group). RESULTS: Cyclic flow  reductions ceased, and complete coronary patency was achieved in all dogs after  they breathed NO combined with zaprinast (by 12.0+/-4.7 min [mean +/- SEM]) or  dipyridamole (by 9.8+/-4.7 min). The frequency of CFRs was unaffected by NO,  dipyridamole or zaprinast alone. Systemic arterial blood pressure and bleeding  time were unchanged with any treatment. Ex vivo thrombin-induced platelet  aggregation in dogs breathing NO and receiving dipyridamole was reduced by  75+/-7% (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The PDE5 inhibitors potentiated the  antithrombotic properties of inhaled NO in a canine model of platelet-mediated  coronary artery thrombosis after thrombolysis, without prolonging the bleeding  time or causing systemic hypotension.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The mechanism of the antithrombotic action of statins is unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of simvastatin on the coagulation  process at sites of microvascular injury. METHODS AND RESULTS: Tissue  factor-initiated coagulation was assessed in blood samples collected every 30  seconds from bleeding-time wounds of 17 patients who had advanced coronary artery  disease and total cholesterol levels of 224.6+/-11.8 mg/dL (mean+/-SEM).  Quantitative Western blotting for time courses of fibrinogen depletion and  activation of prothrombin, factor V, and factor XIII was performed before and  after 3 months of simvastatin treatment (20 mg/d). Simvastatin induced reductions  in total cholesterol (23%) and LDL-cholesterol (36%), which were accompanied by  significant decreases in the rates of prothrombin activation (16.2+/-2.1%;  P=0.004), formation of alpha-thrombin B-chain (27.4+/-1.8%; P=0.001), generation  of factor Va heavy chain (29.7+/-3.1%; P=0.007) and factor Va light chain  (18.9+/-1.2%; P=0.02), factor XIII activation (19.8+/-1.3%; P=0.001), and  fibrinogen conversion to fibrin (72.2+/-3%; P=0.002). Posttreatment  fibrinopeptides A and B concentrations, determined by using high-performance  liquid chromatography, were reduced within the last 30 seconds of bleeding. The  30-kDa fragment of the factor Va heavy chain (residues 307 to 506), produced by  activated protein C, and the 97-kDa fragment of the factor Va heavy chain  (residues 1 to 643) were released more rapidly after simvastatin treatment. The  antithrombotic actions of simvastatin showed no relationship to its  cholesterol-lowering action. CONCLUSIONS: Simvastatin treatment depresses blood  clotting, which leads to reduced rates of prothrombin activation, factor Va  generation, fibrinogen cleavage, factor XIII activation, and an increased rate of  factor Va inactivation. These effects are not related to cholesterol reduction.

AB  - As part of an ongoing study on the initiation of cracks in teeth, 20 teeth exhibiting symptoms consistent with the presence of dentinal cracks were  examined. The presence of a cracked cusp was confirmed by the selective  application of pressure either with a mirror handle or Fracfinder (Svenoka,  Dental Instruments, Vasby, Sweden). Cracked cusps were fractured from the teeth  after the removal of all existing restorations and were immediately placed into  ten percent formalin. Subsequently, specimens were dehydrated, sputter-coated and  examined under the scanning electron microscope (SEM). All the cracked cusps  exhibited complete fracture of the dentine to the level of the dentino-enamel  junction. No partial fractures were seen. Numerous bacteria of many morphological  forms were present on the dentinal surfaces, of all fractured cusps, in all  teeth. Cocci, bacilli and filamentous forms were consistently found. Many  bacteria were in the process of division. While bacterial contamination of  dentinal cracks has been described in histological studies, the nature and  distribution of these bacterial and fungal forms has not been shown previously in  any detail. Prior SEM studies investigating the nature and mechanisms of fracture  have not revealed bacterial contamination of the fractured surface. This paper  draws attention to the fact that all symptomatic cracks in teeth appear to 1.  extend right through the dentine to the dentino-enamel junction, and 2. appear to  be extensively contaminated by bacteria.

TI  - Utilisation of erythrocyte 6-thioguanine metabolite levels to optimise azathioprine therapy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
AU  - Cuffari, C.
AU  - Hunt, S.

T2  - Gut
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: The immunosuppressive properties of 6-mercaptopurine and its parent compound azathioprine are mediated by their intracellular metabolism into  active 6-thioguanine (6-TG) metabolites. Measurement of erythrocyte 6-TG  metabolite levels has been proposed as a useful clinical tool for assessing  treatment efficacy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). AIM: The  purpose of the study was to establish a therapeutic index of treatment efficacy  based on measurement of erythrocyte 6-TG metabolite levels, and apply it  clinically to guide therapy. METHODS: Heparinised blood was obtained from 82  adult patients with IBD on long term (more than three months) antimetabolite  therapy (63 Crohn's disease; 19 ulcerative colitis). Erythrocyte 6-TG metabolite  levels were measured using reverse phase high performance chromatography, and  correlated with treatment efficacy. In 22 patients with refractory Crohn's  disease despite long term azathioprine therapy, their dosage was increased by 25  mg/day at eight week intervals as needed. Serial erythrocyte 6-TG metabolite  levels were measured at each clinic visit and correlated with treatment efficacy.  RESULTS: Clinical remission, as defined by a low disease index score in patients  weaned off or on a low alternate day dose (<20 mg on alternate days) of  corticosteroid, was achieved in 68% of patients on long term antimetabolite  therapy. Treatment efficacy correlated with erythrocyte 6-TG levels greater than  250 pmol/8x10(8) red blood cells in patients with colonic and fistulising Crohn's  disease (p<0.01) but not in patients with ileocolonic disease. Eighteen of 22  patients with incompletely responsive Crohn's disease achieved disease remission  by optimising their dose of azathioprine therapy. Median (range) erythrocyte 6-TG  metabolite levels increased from 194 (67-688) to 303 (67-737) pmol/8x10(8) red  blood cells (p<0.05). Clinical response associated well with a reduction in  corticosteroid requirements. Mean (SEM) white blood cell count decreased from 8.6  (0.9) to 6.9 (0.6) x10(3)/microl with adjustment in azathioprine dosage. No  patient incurred azathioprine induced leucopenia. CONCLUSION: Measurement of  erythrocyte 6-TG metabolite levels is helpful in determining the adequacy of  azathioprine dosage and can be used to optimise the dose of antimetabolite  therapy to achieve an improved clinical response without inducing leucopenia.  Patients who are clinically refractory to azathioprine therapy despite achieving  high erythrocyte 6-TG levels (>250) should be considered for adjunct or  alternative forms of immunosuppressive therapy or surgery.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: It has been postulated that lymphatic insufficiency may have a key role in pressure ulcer development. Our hypothesis is that the particular dynamic  action of the Airwave mattress directly improves lymphatic circulation compared  to conventional hospital mattresses. METHODS: Seven anesthetized sheep (40-48 kg)  prepared with chronic prefemoral lymph fistulas and vascular catheters were first  placed on a standard hospital mattress. Following 30 minutes of equilibration, a  2 hr control period was started measuring lymph flow and vascular pressures. The  standard mattress was then exchanged for an active Airwave mattress (Pegasus  Egerton, Ltd.) and after 30 minutes of equilibration monitored as above. After  2.5 hr, the support surface was then switched back to the standard mattress and  monitored as before. Data are mean +/- sem. RESULTS: Initially, on the standard  mattress, lymph flow was 1.0 +/- 0.2 ml/30 min and increased significantly more  than 3 fold on the Aireave mattress to 3.7 +/- 0.7 ml/30 min. Upon return to the  standard mattress, lymph flow decreased to 1.2 +/- 0.2 ml/30 min. Hemodynamic  variables and arterial blood gases were constant. Lymphatic protein transport  increased significantly from 1.3 +/- 0.3 micrograms/min to 4.3 +/- 1.0  micrograms/min when placed on the test mattress and decreased when returned to  the standard mattress to 1.3 +/- 0.2 micrograms/min. Similar rates of lymph flow  were seen upon a variant of the Airwave mattress (Cairwave Therapy System).  CONCLUSIONS: Results support the hypothesis that the Airwave's action increased  the lymph flow compared to a standard hospital mattress. The dynamic cycle may  act to aid the pumping action of lymphatics by reducing pressure which would  otherwise collapse and compress lymphatics leading to local edema and tissue  swelling.

AB  - Our group recently demonstrated that autoimmune T cells directed against central nervous system-associated myelin antigens protect neurons from secondary  degeneration. We further showed that the synthetic peptide copolymer 1 (Cop-1),  known to suppress experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, can be safely  substituted for the natural myelin antigen in both passive and active  immunization for neuroprotection of the injured optic nerve. Here we attempted to  determine whether similar immunizations are protective from retinal ganglion cell  loss resulting from a direct biochemical insult caused, for example, by glutamate  (a major mediator of degeneration in acute and chronic optic nerve insults) and  in a rat model of ocular hypertension. Passive immunization with T cells reactive  to myelin basic protein or active immunization with myelin oligodendrocyte  glycoprotein-derived peptide, although neuroprotective after optic nerve injury,  was ineffective against glutamate toxicity in mice and rats. In contrast, the  number of surviving retinal ganglion cells per square millimeter in  glutamate-injected retinas was significantly larger in mice immunized 10 days  previously with Cop-1 emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant than in mice  injected with PBS in the same adjuvant (2,133 +/- 270 and 1,329 +/- 121,  respectively, mean +/- SEM; P < 0.02). A similar pattern was observed when mice  were immunized on the day of glutamate injection (1,777 +/- 101 compared with  1,414 +/- 36; P < 0.05), but not when they were immunized 48 h later. These  findings suggest that protection from glutamate toxicity requires reinforcement  of the immune system by antigens that are different from those associated with  myelin. The use of Cop-1 apparently circumvents this antigen specificity barrier.  In the rat ocular hypertension model, which simulates glaucoma, immunization with  Cop-1 significantly reduced the retinal ganglion cell loss from 27.8% +/- 6.8% to  4.3% +/- 1.6%, without affecting the intraocular pressure. This study may point  the way to a therapy for glaucoma, a neurodegenerative disease of the optic nerve  often associated with increased intraocular pressure, as well as for acute and  chronic degenerative disorders in which glutamate is a prominent participant.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The mechanisms by which maternal ethanol abuse during pregnancy causes neurodevelopmental injury in the fetus are not well understood. The  purpose of this study was to use a chronically instrumented fetal sheep model  system to determine if a binge pattern of ethanol exposure administered  throughout the third trimester reduced fetal arterial partial pressure of oxygen  (PaO2); a positive finding would support the hypothesis that fetal hypoxemia may  play a role in mediating ethanol-related birth defects. METHODS: Pregnant ewes  received saline or 0.75, 1.25, 1.5, or 1.75 g/kg of ethanol intravenously over 1  hr beginning on day 109 of gestation (term = 145 days) for 3 consecutive days per  week followed by 4 days without exposure. The fetuses were surgically  instrumented on day 113, and experiments were performed on days 118 or 132, the  6th and the 12th ethanol exposure, respectively. RESULTS: Ethanol infusions  resulted in peak blood ethanol concentrations of 80.8 +/- 6.5, 182.5 +/- 13.5,  224.4 +/- 13.9, and 260.6 +/- 20.0 mg/dl +/- SEM (maternal) and 70.0 +/- 5.9,  149.7 +/- 9.0, 216.9 +/- 14.0, and 233.3 +/- 19.8 mg/dl +/- SEM (fetal) in  response to the 0.75, 1.25, 1.5, and 1.75 g/kg doses, respectively. Maternal and  fetal heart rate and maternal blood pressure increased whereas fetal blood  pressure decreased in a dose-dependent manner in response to ethanol infusions.  Maternal and fetal arterial pH decreased and arterial partial pressures of carbon  dioxide increased in response to ethanol infusions. Maternal PaO2 decreased  whereas fetal PaO2 did not change in response to ethanol infusions. CONCLUSIONS:  A binge ethanol exposure paradigm, three consecutive days per week throughout the  third trimester at ethanol doses that created blood ethanol concentrations  commonly achieved by human ethanol abusers, resulted in changes in maternal and  fetal heart rate, changes in blood pressure, hypercapnea, acidemia, and maternal,  but not fetal, hypoxemia. We conclude that in an ovine model system, ethanol  doses that create blood ethanol concentrations as high as 260 mg/dl do not result  in fetal hypoxemia. Remaining issues to address with this model system are  whether neurodevelopmental injuries that are associated with maternal ethanol  abuse are mediated by a reduction in fetal cerebral blood flow, fetal  hypercapnea, or acidemia.

AB  - Vitamin E content of cardiac tissue has been proposed to play a major role in the damage caused by myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I-R). Previous studies using in  vitro models have examined vitamin E deficiency and I-R-induced myocardial damage  with equivocal results. The purpose of this study was to use an in vivo model of  myocardial I-R to determine the effects of vitamin E deficiency on myocardial  I-R-induced damage. Female Sprague-Dawley rats (4-mo old) were assigned to  either: 1) control diet (CON), or 2) vitamin E deficient diet (VE-DEF). The CON  diet was prepared to meet AIN-93M standards, which contains 75 IU vitamin E/kg  diet. The VE-DEF diet was the AIN-93M diet prepared with tocopherol stripped corn  oil and no vitamin E. Following a 14-week feeding period, significant differences  (p < 0.05) existed in mean myocardial VE levels between groups (mean values +/-  SEM: CON = 48.2 +/- 3.5; VE-DEF = 12.4 +/- 1.4 micrograms VE/g wet weight).  Animals from both experimental groups were subjected to an in vivo I-R protocol  consisting of 25 minutes of left coronary artery occlusion followed by 10 minutes  of reperfusion. No group differences (p > 0.05) existed in cardiac performance  (peak arterial pressure or ventricular work) or the incidence of ventricular  arrhythmias during the I-R protocol. VE-DEF animals had significantly higher (p <  0.05) levels of myocardial lipid peroxidation and lower (p < 0.05) protein thiols  following I-R compared to the CON animals. These data suggest that although  vitamin E deficiency increases oxidative damage resulting from myocardial I-R, it  does not affect cardiac performance during the insult.

AB  - Plasma levels of ANP (pg/ml; radioimmunoassay) as a parameter for postischemic dysfunction and levels of Troponin T (TnT) (ng/ml; ELISA test) as a parameter for  postischemic cellular damage were determined in 15 patients with coronary artery  disease (CAD) (mean age: 58 +/- 6.1 years; 13 m, 2 w; with no history of  myocardial infarction and no signs for congestive heart failure) prior to, during  and after extracorporal circulation (ECC). Under standardized conditions during  the ECC basic parameters concerning the cardial hemodynamic (heart rate (HR);  systolic (RRsys, mmHg), diastolic pressure (RR dia, mmHg) central venous pressure  (CVP, mmHg); left atrial pressure (LAP, mmHg); left ventricular enddiastolic  pressure (LVEDP, mmHg)) and ECG monitoring blood samples were performed: 1) prior  to operation (op); 2) prior to CPB; 3) 1 h CPB; 4) 5 min after CPB; 5) 1 h after  CPB; 6) 6 h postoperative (postop); 7) 24 h postop; 8) 48 h postop; 9) 10 days  postop. Also the left atrial diameter (LAD, mm) and the left ventricular  enddiastolic diameter at Q (LVEDD, mm) pre- and postop were documented with  m-mode echocardiography (Echo) and ejection fraction (EF, %) was calculated. The  bypass operations were performed with intermittent aortic cross-clamping with  open venae cavae (CVP: 0-5 mmHg) and moderate hypothermia. For the determination  of ANP levels and TnT levels in arterial and venous blood, a double-antibody (AB)  radioimmunoassay and an ELISA test were used. Concerning the patients with CAD  there was a maximal increase of ANP from preoperative 90 +/- 10 (M +/- SEM) pg/ml  (p < 0.05) up to intraoperative 380 +/- 38 pg/ml. Ten days postop, the ANP level  was with 262 +/- 33 pg/ml still increased threefold in comparison to the  preoperative level. TnT showed an increase from preoperative 0.02 +/- 0.01 ng/ml  up to intraoperative 3.44 +/- 0.47 ng/ml. Ten days postop the TnT concentration  was at the preoperative level with 0.13 +/- 0.11 ng/ml. Five minutes after bypass  up to 48 h postop, ANP and TnT levels were correlated (p < 0.05, r = 3.4). There  was an increase of the LAD from preoperative 42.2 +/- 1.1 mm up to 46.8 +/- 1.2  mm (p < 0.05) 10 days postop as determined by m-mode echo. LVEDD and EF changed  from preoperative 51.1 +/- 0.9 mm and 73 +/- 2% to 54.5 +/- 1.2 mm and 65 +/- 4%  10 days postop. The significant increase of TnT (172-fold) indicates the  cellular, myocardial injury, caused by the operation without signs in ECG  recordings and no signs of congestive heart failure. The significantly increased  ANP level up to the 10th day postop indicate sa very sensitive prolonged,  postischemic dysfunction, which is not compensated 10 days postop.

AB  - Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome is a disease with functional lung heterogeneity and thus a ventilator-delivered breath may over-distend  non-involved areas. In rats we examined ventilator-delivered tidal volume (TV)  breaths of 7 and 20 ml/kg on lung water as evidence of lung injury. We examined  the role of aquaporins on ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) by infusing  HgCl(2) which inhibits aquaporins by binding cysteine. Wet to dry lung weight  ratio (W/D) as evidence of lung water was 4.47+/-0.1 SEM in controls, 4.6+/-0.1  and 5.5+/-0.2 (P<0.05) in rats ventilated at 7 and 20 ml/kg, respectively.  Pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) rose from 23+/-1 to 26+/-1 mmHg (P<0.05, n=7) and  cardiac output fell from 104+/-2 to 67+/-3 ml/min (P<0.05) in rats ventilated at  20 ml/kg. Left ventricular end diastolic pressure (n=3) was unchanged. Evans Blue  dye, an albumin marker, increased from a control 37+/-11 to 97+/-41 mg/g wet lung  in TV 20 rats (P<0.05). HgCl(2) infused slowly by tail vein did not significantly  raise PAP, but did increase W/D to 6+/-0.2 (P<0.05) in rats ventilated at 20  ml/kg but not at 7 ml/kg. Equimolar cysteine infusions prevented the HgCl(2) from  increasing the W/D above that seen with TV 20 ml/kg. Thus ventilation with TV of  20 ml/kg produced a protein-rich lung edema. Aquaporin channels may have a  protective effect in VILI.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The respiratory inductive plethysmograph (RIP) can be used to monitor changes in end-expiratory lung volume (deltaEELV), and thus, used in intensive  care when evaluating positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)-induced changes in  lung volumes in order to optimise the ventilator settings. We validated the  newest model of RIP (Respitrace Plus), both under laboratory and clinical  conditions, and made a comparison with a previously validated RIP (Respigraph) in  the measurement of tidal volume (V(T)), long-term EELV and PEEP-induced acute  deltaEELV. METHODS: The in vitro validation was performed using a lung model and  the in vivo evaluation in five spontaneously breathing normal subjects, four  patients with acute lung injury (ALI) and eight anaesthetised patients. RESULTS:  The difference in V(T) values during PEEP manipulations between pneumotachometer  (PNT) and RIP in spontaneously breathing volunteers and mechanically ventilated  ALI patients was 0.1-0.9% (mean+/-SEM) and -5.2+/-0.6, respectively (effect of  device NS). In anaesthetised patients, the difference between the new RIP and  spirometer in the measurement of PEEP-induced acute deltaEELV was -2.6+/-1.5%  (PEEP-device interaction, P<0.05). In ALI patients, the difference between PNT  and RIP in the measurement of PEEP-induced acute deltaEELV was 1.0+/-9.7% (NS).  The new RIP had a baseline drift over 50-fold when cold and over 10-fold when  warm compared to the old RIP in vitro. CONCLUSION: The new RIP is accurate enough  for clinical and research purposes in the measurement of V(T). Semiquantitative  measurements of acute deltaEELV can be done with accuracy sufficient for clinical  use, but long-term deltaEELV monitoring is not possible. The new RIP should be  kept on for several hours before measurements to minimise the drift.

T2  - Medicine and science in sports and exercise
AB  - PURPOSE: We have previously shown that the combination of low-intensity resistive exercise and moderate vascular occlusion induces in humans a marked increase in  growth hormone secretion and muscular hypertrophy. The present study investigated  the effects of vascular occlusion on the size of thigh muscles in patients who  underwent an operation for the reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament  to see whether it attenuates the disuse muscular atrophy without any exercise  combined. METHODS: Two sessions of occlusive stimulus, each consisting of five  repetitions of vascular occlusion (mean maximal pressure, 238 mm Hg) for 5 min  and the release of occlusion for 3 min, were applied daily to the proximal end of  the thigh from 3rd to 14th days after the operation. Changes in the  cross-sectional area (CSA) of thigh muscles were analyzed with magnetic resonance  images taken on the 3rd and 14th day after the operation. RESULTS: Without  occlusive stimulus (control), the CSAs of knee extensors and flexors decreased by  20.7 +/- 2.2% and 11.3 +/- 2.6% (mean +/- SEM, N = 8), whereas with the occlusive  stimulus, they decreased by 9.4 +/- 1.6% and 9.2 +/- 2.6% (N = 8), respectively.  The relative decrease in CSA of knee extensors was significantly (P < 0.05)  larger in the control group than in the experimental group. CONCLUSION: The  results indicate that the occlusive stimulus effectively diminishes the  postoperation disuse atrophy of knee extensors.

AB  - The present study was undertaken to investigate hepatic microcirculatory response following partial portal vein ligation (PPVL) in rats. Portal pressure was  markedly increased 2-6 wk after PPVL, but no significant reduction in sinusoidal  perfusion and hepatocellular injury were detected. However, marked  neovascularization was observed in PPVL rats using intravital microscopy and  scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Extremely high red blood cell velocity  (2,000-4,900 microm/s) was seen in these vessels. Injection of fluorescein sodium  via the carotid artery revealed that the neovessels originated from the hepatic  arterial vasculature. This was further confirmed by clamping the common hepatic  artery and phenylephrine injection from the carotid artery. These vessels  maintained sufficient flow after massive sinusoidal shutdown elicited by the  portal infusion of endothelin receptor B agonist IRL-1620. SEM also showed  extensive neovascularization at the hilum. Additionally, clamping the portal vein  decreased sinusoidal perfusion only by 9.5% in PPVL, whereas a 71.2% decrease was  observed in sham. These results strongly suggest that the liver maintains its  microcirculatory flow by vascular remodeling from the hepatic arterial  vasculature following PPVL.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the non-peptide angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist irbesartan (SR 47436, BMS 186295,  2-n-butyl-3 [2'-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)-biphenyl-4-yl)methyl]-1,3-diaza-spiro  [4,4]non-1-en-4-one) has myocardial protective effects during regional myocardial  ischemia/reperfusion in vivo. Eighteen anesthetized open-chest dogs were  instrumented for measurement of left ventricular and aortic pressure (tip  manometer and pressure transducer, respectively), and coronary flow (ultrasonic  flowprobes). Regional myocardial function was assessed by Doppler displacement  transducers as systolic wall thickening (sWT) in the antero-apical and the  postero-basal wall. The animals underwent 1 h of left anterior descending  coronary artery (LAD) occlusion and subsequent reperfusion for 3 hours.  Irbesartan (10 mg kg(-1), n = 9) or the vehicle (KOH, control, n = 9) was  injected intravenously 30 min before LAD occlusion. Regional myocardial blood  flow (RMBF) was measured after irbesartan injection and at 30 min LAD occlusion  using colored microspheres. Infarct size was determined by triphenyltetrazolium  chloride staining after 3 h of reperfusion. There was no recovery of sWT in the  LAD perfused area in both groups at the end of the experiments (systolic bulging,  -15.1+/-6.1% of baseline (irbesartan) vs. -12.3+/-3.0% (control), mean+/-SEM).  Irbesartan led to an increase in RMBF in normal myocardium (2.47+/-0.40 vs.  1.35+/-0.28 ml min(-1) g(-1), p<0.05), and also to an increase in collateral  blood flow to the ischemic area (0.27+/-0.04 vs. 0.17+/-0.02 ml min(-1) g(-1), P  = <0.05). Infarct size (percent of area at risk) was 24.8+/-3.2 % in the  treatment group compared with 26.9+/-4.8% in the control group (P = 0.72). These  results indicate that a blockade of angiotensin II AT1 receptors with irbesartan  before coronary artery occlusion led to an increase in RMBF, but did not result  in a significant reduction of myocardial infarct size.

AB  - PURPOSE: Visual field defects after vitrectomy can be seen after any surgery involving fluid-air exchange. To elucidate the effect during surgery of the  infused air on the retina, the present study investigated the changes in the  morphology of the rabbit retina induced by air infusion and the changes resulting  from varying amounts of infused air pressure. METHODS: Eighteen eyes of 18  rabbits were used. A standard three-port vitrectomy with artificial posterior  vitreous detachment followed by fluid-air exchange was performed in 12 eyes.  During the fluid-air exchange, humidified air was infused with an air pressure of  25 or 40 mm Hg for 30 seconds. As a control, vitrectomy without fluid-air  exchange was performed in six eyes. The eyes were enucleated and fixed  immediately. Specimens were processed and examined by light and scanning electron  microscopy (SEM). RESULTS: With SEM, sharply demarcated retinal lesions were  observed at the opposite side from the infusion cannula in all eyes in which a  fluid-air exchange was performed. At the lesion, the internal limiting membrane  was often detached, and the underlying nerve fiber layer was exposed. Light  microscopy revealed that the inner retina was most affected, with concomitant  swelling of the inner plexiform layer and the inner granular layer. In addition,  the retina was often focally detached with adhesion of some retinal pigment  epithelial cells to the photoreceptor cells. Increased infused air pressure was  accompanied by a significant increase in the area of retinal damage. In contrast,  no morphologic change was observed in the control eyes. CONCLUSIONS: Air infusion  during vitrectomy can cause mechanical retinal damage in the rabbit retina. The  mechanical damage may result in a visual field defect after vitrectomy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) gene transfection has been shown to enhance myocardial tolerance after normothermic ischemia-reperfusion. We  investigated the effect of HSP70 gene transfection on mechanical and endothelial  function in a protocol mimicking clinical heart preservation. METHODS AND  RESULTS: Rat hearts were infused ex vivo with Hemagglutinating Virus of  Japan-liposome complex containing HSP70 gene (HSP, n=8) or no gene (CON, n=8),  and heterotopically transplanted into recipient rats. Four days after surgery,  transfected hearts were perfused on a Langendorff apparatus for 45 minutes,  arrested with St Thomas' No. 1 cardioplegia for 4 hours at 4 degrees C, and  reperfused for 1 hour. Mechanical and endothelial function was studied before and  after ischemia. Creatine kinase was measured in reperfusion effluent. Hearts  underwent Western blotting and immunohistochemistry to confirm HSP70  overexpression. Postischemic recovery of mechanical function (%  preischemic+/-SEM) was greater in HSP versus CON: Left ventricular developed  pressure recovery was 76.7+/-3.9% versus 60. 5+/-3.1% (P:<0.05); dP/dtmax  recovery was 79.4+/-4.9% versus 56. 2+/-3.2% (P:<0.05); dP/dtmin recovery was  74.8+/-4.6% versus 57. 3+/-3.6% (P:<0.05). Creatine kinase release was attenuated  in HSP versus CON: 0.22+/-0.02 versus 0.32+/-0.04 IU/min/g wet wt. (P:<0. 05).  Recovery of coronary flow was greater in HSP versus CON: 76. 5+/-3.8% versus  59.2+/-3.2% (P:<0.05). Recovery of coronary response to 5-hydroxytryptamine (5 x  10(-)(5) mol/L) was 55.6+/-4.7% versus 23. 9+/-3.2% (P:<0.05); recovery of  coronary response to glyceryltrinitrate (15 mg/L) was not different between HSP  and CON: 87.4+/-6.9% versus 84.3+/-5.8% (NS). CONCLUSIONS: In a clinically  relevant donor heart preservation protocol, HSP70 gene transfection protects both  mechanical and endothelial function.

AU  - Mundy, A. L.

T2  - British journal of anaesthesia
AB  - The role of nitric oxide (NO) in precipitating pulmonary oedema in acute lung injury remains unclear. We have investigated the mechanism of involvement of NO  in the maintenance of liquid balance in the isolated rabbit lung. Thirty pairs of  lungs were perfused with colloid for up to 6 h, during which pulmonary vascular  resistance (PVR) and capillary pressure (PCP) were measured frequently, and time  to gain 5 g in weight (t5) was recorded. Four protocols with different perfusate  additives were studied: (i) none (control, n = 11); (ii) 10 mmol  NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) (n = 6); (iii) 10 mmol L-NAME with 100  mumol lodoxamide, an inhibitor of mast cell degranulation (n = 7); (iv) 10 mmol  L-NAME with 10 mumol 8-bromo-3',5'-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (8Br-cGMP), an  analogue of cGMP that may reduce vascular permeability by relaxing contractile  elements in endothelial cells (n = 6). Neither PVR nor PCP differed between  protocols. L-NAME markedly reduced t5 from 248 (27) min (mean (SEM)) in protocol  (i) to 144 (5) min in protocol (ii) (P < 0.05). Both lodoxamide (t5 = 178 (7)  min) and 8Br-cGMP (t5 = 204 (10) min) substantially corrected the effect of  L-NAME (P < 0.005). Results suggest that maintenance of a low permeability by NO  may involve mast cell stabilization and endothelial cell relaxation.

AB  - Reperfusion injury after coronary occlusion is in part mediated by leukocyte activation and adhesion. Platelets may interact with polymorphonuclear  granulocytes (PMNs), causing aggravated reperfusion injury. We studied whether  c7E3Fab, a chimeric Fab fragment blocking platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa,  decreases PMN-platelet-dependent myocardial dysfunction after ischemia. Isolated  guinea pig hearts (n=5 per group) perfused at a constant flow of 5 mL/min were  subjected to ischemia (15 minutes, 37 degrees C) and reperfusion. Human PMNs  (10x10(6) cells, 3 mL), platelets (400x10(6), 3 mL), and fibrinogen (1 mg/mL)  were infused for 3 minutes after 2 minutes of reperfusion, with or without  c7E3Fab. Flow cytometry detected GPIIb/IIIa (platelets) and MAC-1 (aMbeta2, PMNs)  as well as coaggregates of both in the effluent, whereas double-fluorescence  microscopy visualized intracoronary PMN-platelet coaggregates. Postischemic  recovery of pressure-volume work (12-cm H(2)O preload and 60-mm Hg afterload) was  defined as the ratio of postischemic to preischemic external heart work  (mean+/-SEM). c7E3Fab reduced platelet GPIIb/IIIa detection to 10% of controls,  blocked a transcoronary MAC-1 increase (+25% without versus -23% with c7E3Fab),  and inhibited PMN-platelet coaggregation in the effluent (49+/-12% without versus  17+/-2% with c7E3Fab) as well as in the hearts themselves (5.0+/-0.7/cm(2)  without versus 1.2+/-0.3/cm(2) surface area with c7E3Fab). Postischemic recovery  of external heart work (83+/-5% in cell-free hearts) declined to 46+/-4% after  postischemic PMN-platelet infusion, but not in the presence of c7E3Fab (74+/-11%)  or LPM19c (71+/-6%). We conclude that c7E3Fab inhibits formation of PMN-platelet  aggregates during myocardial reperfusion, an effect that protects against  PMN-platelet-dependent stunning.

AB  - Post-ischemic reperfusion causes a change in inositol phosphate responses to norepinephrine from primary generation of inositol(1,4) bis phosphate  (Ins(1,4)P(2)) to generation of inositol(1,4,5) tris phosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P(3))  that is required for the initiation of reperfusion arrhythmias. The current study  was undertaken to investigate the role of Na(+)/H(+)exchange in facilitating this  transient change in inositol phosphate response. Rat hearts were subjected to 20  min ischemia followed by 2 min reperfusion and Ins(1, 4,5)P(3)content was  measured by mass analysis or by anion-exchange HPLC following [(3)H]inositol  labeling. Reperfusion caused generation of [(3)H]Ins(1,4,5)P(3)(1732+/-398 to  3103+/-214, cpm/g tissue, mean+/-S.E.M., n=5, P<0.01) and the development of  arrhythmias. Inhibition of Na(+)/H(+)exchange, by reperfusing at pH 6.3 or by  pretreating with HOE-694 (10 n M-3 microM) or HOE-642 (3 microM) prevented the  [(3)H]Ins(1,4,5)P(3)generation, without causing any suppression of norepinephrine  release. Increases in Ins(1,4,5)P(3)mass were similarly reduced by inhibition of  Na(+)/H(+)exchange. Thus, activation of Na(+)/H(+)exchange is required for the  enhanced Ins(1,4,5)P(3)response observed under reperfusion conditions, and  prevention of Ins(1,4,5)P(3)generation may be an important contributor to the  anti-arrhythmic actions of inhibitors of Na(+)/H(+)exchange.

T2  - Journal of forensic sciences
AB  - The forensic investigator is frequently confronted with cases that present with wounds and blunt force trauma. Presently, the forensic investigator depends upon  previous experience and further investigative deduction of the crime scene to  analyze these injuries. Although not readily apparent to the naked eye, many skin  tissue injuries can be visualized with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). This  study was designed to establish skin trauma resolution using SEM in various skin  preparations. Tissue trauma was induced on leather, preserved skin, fresh skin,  and living skin using dies of varying thread size. Calibrated pressure forces in  pounds per square inch (psi) were applied and impressions made using vinyl  polysiloxane. Positive replicas of the tissues were prepared for SEM using  isocyanate resin. After sputter coating the cast with 35 nm of gold-palladium,  electron micrographs were generated using a Jeol JSM-5310LV scanning electron  microscope. To establish resolution, thread widths of 52, 104, and 208 threads  per inch (tpi) and trauma forces of 150, 200, and 250 psi were used to produce  the impressions. Microgrooves that were identified on the die threads were  analyzed. The optimum pressure for resolution studies was 150 psi using the 52  tpi die on the leather sample (4.67 +/- 0.88 microm, p = 0.046 and 0.025,  respectively, by ANOVA). The resolution was compared to that of leather using  preserved, fresh, and living skin. The resolution in preserved and fresh skin was  less than for leather (9.00 +/- 1.73 and 10.5 +/- 4.5 versus 4.67 +/- 0.88  microm, p = 0.09 and p = 0.20, respectively). Living skin resolution was 3 microm  at 52 tpi and 100 psi. Various implements of blunt force trauma were also  examined using the leather sample. Time after trauma resolution was examined at 0  (3 microm), 5 (6 microm), 10 (8 microm), and 20 (9 microm) min in living tissue.  A comparison between the microgrooves on the die replicas and the tissue trauma  impressions revealed striking agreement for both linearity and resolution.  Analysis of the microgrooves suggests that discrete morphological characteristics  are seen in skin tissue traumas. This method could expand the tools available for  the forensic investigation of blunt force trauma.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The majority of early trauma deaths are attributable to uncontrolled hemorrhage from truncal sites. A hemorrhage-control technique that reduced  bleeding in the prehospital phase of treatment without requiring manual  compression may improve the outcome of these patients. We conducted this  preliminary study to determine whether an expanding fibrin sealant foam (FSF)  would reduce bleeding from a severe liver injury even during resuscitation.  METHODS: Rats (n = 31; 291 +/- 5 g; 37.4 +/- 0.3 degrees C; mean +/- SEM),  underwent a 60 +/- 5% excision of the median hepatic lobe. The animals received  one of three treatments: (1) FSF, (2) immunoglobulin G placebo foam (IgGF), or  (3) no treatment. All animals were resuscitated with 40 degrees C lactated  Ringer's solution at 3.3 mL/ min/kg to a mean arterial pressure of 100 mm Hg.  Total blood loss, mean arterial pressure, and resuscitation volume were recorded  for 30 minutes. A qualitative measure of foam coverage and adherence to the cut  liver edge was recorded. RESULTS: The total blood loss was less (p < 0.01) in the  FSF group (21.2 +/- 5.0 mL/kg) than in either IgGF (41.4 +/- 4.3 mL/kg) or the no  treatment group (44.6 +/- 4.7 mL/kg), which did not differ. The resuscitation  volume was not different. The amount of foam used in the treated groups, 9.1 +/-  1.0 g in the FSF group and 10.0 +/- 1.0 g in the IgGF group, did not differ.  Survival for 30 minutes was not different among groups. There was no difference  in the amount of cut liver covered by either foam, but the clots were more  adherent (p < 0.05) in the FSF group than in the IgGF group. CONCLUSION: In rats  with a severe liver injury, spraying fibrin foam directly on the cut liver  surface decreased blood loss when compared with placebo foam and no treatment.  This pilot study suggests a future possible treatment for noncompressible truncal  hemorrhage.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Suicide attempts with agricultural chemicals are common in southern Taiwan. Among them, glyphosate-surfactant herbicide (GlySH) intoxication has been  encountered with increasing frequency. Although a number of reports have  described the clinical course and outcomes following ingestion, predictors of  serious complications and mortality have not been elucidated. The purpose of this  study was to define predictors of serious complications and probable mortality.  METHODS: This was a retrospective study of 131 GlySH-intoxicated patients treated  at the National Cheng Kung University Hospital from 1988 to 1995. Medical charts  were reviewed and clinical and laboratory variables were abstracted, looking for  predictors of mortality. RESULTS: The most common symptoms included sore throat  (79.5%), and nausea with or without vomiting (73.8%). The most common laboratory  findings were leukocytosis (68.0%), low serum bicarbonate (48.1%), and acidosis  (35.8%). Overall, 11 of 131 patients (8.4%) died; the mean +/- SEM time to death  was 2.8 +/- 0.8 days after presentation. When comparing the clinical and  laboratory characteristics among the survivor and fatality groups, significant  differences were identified. Respiratory distress, pulmonary edema, respiratory  distress necessitating intubation, shock (systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm  Hg), altered consciousness, abnormal chest x-ray, renal failure necessitating  hemodialysis, larger amount of ingestion (>200 mL), and hyperkalemia were  predictors highly associated with poor outcomes and mortality. Using multiple  logistic regression, three predictors were identified, which may predict  mortality in severely intoxicated patients. CONCLUSIONS: In managing patients who  have larger amount of GlySH ingestion, airway protection, early detection of  pulmonary edema, and prevention of further pulmonary damage and renal damage  appear to be of critical importance.

T2  - Critical care medicine
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Gut injury and barrier dysfunction may contribute to the pathogenesis of sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. The objective of this study  was to determine whether gut injury could be demonstrated in hyperdynamic,  normotensive sepsis induced by Pseudomonas pneumonia. DESIGN: Randomized animal  study. SETTING: University laboratory. SUBJECTS: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats.  INTERVENTIONS: Sepsis was induced by intratracheal instillation of Pseudomonas  aeruginosa. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We measured gut mucosal and  microvascular injury. In the first experiment, gut mucosal permeability was  measured by 51Cr-EDTA uptake in control (n = 6), pneumonia 20-hr (n = 4), and  pneumonia 40-hr (n = 4) groups. In the second experiment, microvascular  permeability was measured by albumin extravasation, and morphologic abnormalities  were scored in control (n = 6), pneumonia 20-hr (n = 9), and pneumonia 40-hr (n =  11) groups. Bacterial translocation to mesenteric lymph nodes was determined in  both experiments. Cardiac index increased significantly in the pneumonia compared  with control rats (64+/-2.1, 68+/-1.3, vs. 46+/-2 mL/min/100 g, p < .05; all  results are listed in the order of pneumonia 20-hr, pneumonia 40-hr, and control  groups as mean +/- SEM). Mean blood pressure was normal and was not different  between groups (112+/-3, 111+/-2, vs. 118+/-2 mm Hg). 51Cr-EDTA recovery in urine  6 hrs after gavage increased significantly in both pneumonia groups vs. controls  (17.5+/-2.2%, 17.9+/-7%, vs. 4+/-0.7%; p < .05). Albumin leak (tissue/plasma  ratio) increased significantly in the middle and distal small intestine in the  pneumonia 40-hr group vs. controls (0.68+/-0.05, 0.76+/-0.07, vs. 0.45+/-0.04, p  < .05 in the middle small gut; 0.75+/-0.09, 0.85+/-0.07, vs. 0.51+/-0.05, p < .05  in the distal small gut). Bacterial translocation to mesenteric lymph nodes  increased significantly in pneumonia 40-hr rats vs. controls (positive culture  67% vs. 8%; p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates gut mucosal and  microvascular injury and gut barrier dysfunction in normotensive sepsis secondary  to bacterial pneumonia. The mechanism and significance of the injury need to be  determined.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Cardiopulmonary bypass activates leukocytes, which should injure the coronary endothelium and myocardium during reperfusion especially after long  cardioplegic arrest with long cardiopulmonary bypass time. The present study was  designed to determine the protective efficacy of leukocyte-depleted reperfusion  in blood-perfused parabiotic isolated rabbit hearts as a surgically relevant  model with long cardioplegic arrest. METHODS: Each isolated rabbit heart, with a  latex balloon inserted in the left ventricle, was parabiotically blood-perfused  using a modified Langendorff column. The left ventricular developed pressure  (DP), rate of pressure development (dP/dT), and coronary flow with a left  ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 10 mmHg were measured before ischemia and  after 15, 30, 45, and 60 min reperfusion after 4 h cardioplegic arrest kept at 20  degrees C (control, n=10). Leukocyte-depleted reperfusion was done in the test  group (n=10). The endothelium of the coronary artery was observed by scanning  electron microscopy (SEM) with percent injured area of endothelial cells measured  to evaluate the extent of endothelial ischemia-reperfusion injury. RESULTS: The  control hearts showed 53.3, 54.3, 48.4, and 39.0% recovery of DP compared to the  pre-ischemia baseline data at 15, 30, 45, and 60 min after reperfusion began  respectively. Leukocyte-depleted reperfusion enhanced the recovery of DP at 45  min (81.3%, P=0.0021) and 60 min (85.8%, P=0.0005) after reperfusion compared  with that in the control group. The control hearts revealed 58.8%, 59.8%, 52.6%,  and 43.4% recovery of dP/dT compared to the pre-ischemia baseline data at 15, 30,  45, and 60 min after reperfusion began, respectively. Leukocyte-depleted  reperfusion also enhanced the recovery of dP/dT at 45 min (93.2%, P=0.0071) and  60 min (98.8%, P=0.0011) after reperfusion compared with that in the control  group. There was also improvement of the recovery of coronary flow by  leukocyte-depleted reperfusion (97.2%) compared with that in the control group  (58.3%) after 60 min reperfusion (P=0.0121). Scanning electron microscopy showed  that 69. 7% of coronary endothelial cells were morphologically injured in the  control group. In contrast, leukocyte-depleted reperfusion prevented the extent  of coronary endothelial damage with less injured area (0. 5%, P=0.0002).  CONCLUSIONS: Leukocyte-depleted reperfusion improved functional recovery with  reduced coronary endothelial injury after long cardioplegic arrest.

AB  - The Ramipril Efficacy in Nephropathy (REIN) study found that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors effectively decreased proteinuria,  glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline (DeltaGFR), and incidence of end-stage  renal disease (ESRD) in patients with proteinuric chronic nephropathies. In this  study, we prospectively investigated the main clinical determinants of  progression and response to treatment in the 352 patients enrolled into the REIN  study. Mean DeltaGFR (0.56 +/- 0.05 [SEM] versus 0.21 +/- 0.05 mL/min/1.73  m(2)/mo; P = 0.0001) and incidence of ESRD (30% and 10%; P = 0.0001) were more  than twice that in patients with proteinuria of 2 g/24 h or greater of protein  compared with those with protein less than 2 g/24 h (relative risk [RR], 4.07;  95% confidence interval [CI], 2.20 to 7.52), as well as in patients with  hypertension compared with normotension (mean DeltaGFR, 0.48 +/- 0. 05 versus  0.22 +/- 0.05 mL/min/1.73 m(2)/mon; P = 0.0006; ESRD, 25% versus 10%; P = 0.004;  RR, 3.18; 95% CI, 1.38 to 7.32). Hypertension at study entry (P = 0.038), greater  mean blood pressure on follow-up (P = 0.002), and urinary protein excretion rate  (P = 0.0001) were independent predictors of faster DeltaGFR. DeltaGFR was  approximately twofold faster in patients with type 2 diabetes than in those with  primary glomerular disease (P = 0.002; including immunoglobulin A [IgA]  nephropathy, P = 0.009); nephrosclerosis (P = 0.03), adult polycystic kidney  disease (APKD), or chronic interstitial nephritis (P = 0.006). Diabetes at study  entry (P = 0. 02) and greater mean blood pressure (P = 0.0001) and urinary  protein excretion rate (P = 0.0001) on follow-up were independent predictors of  faster DeltaGFR. After correction for baseline covariates, diabetes was also  associated with an increased risk for progression to ESRD (RR, 2.39; 95% CI, 1.01  to 5.68; P < 0.05). At multivariate analyses, ramipril significantly decreased  DeltaGFR (regression coefficient,-0.23 +/- 0.11 [SEM]; P = 0.036) and ESRD (RR,  2.08; 95% CI, 1.21 to 3.57; P = 0.008) in patients with baseline proteinuria of 2  g/24 h or greater of protein, and the renoprotective effect increased for  increasing levels of proteinuria. Ramipril decreased DeltaGFR to a similar extent  in normotensive and hypertensive patients (-0.14 +/- 0.11 versus -0.14 +/- 0.09)  and significantly limited ESRD in hypertensive patients (RR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.26  to 3. 26; P = 0.004). DeltaGFR was decreased by 42% in primary glomerular disease  (P = 0.017), by 35% in IgA nephropathy, and by 37% in nephrosclerosis, but was  not improved in type 2 diabetes, APKD, or interstitial nephritis. At multivariate  analyses, ramipril significantly slowed DeltaGFR (-0.24 +/-0.08; P = 0.004) and  progression to ESRD (RR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.36 to 3.96; P = 0.002) in patients  without diabetes, but not in patients with diabetes, who tended to have a faster  DeltaGFR (+0.62 +/- 0.44) on ramipril therapy. In summary, patients with  proteinuria of 2 g/24 h or greater of protein, preexisting hypertension, or type  2 diabetes were faster progressors. Greater blood pressure and degree of  proteinuria were the strongest determinants of faster GFR decline. The  renoprotective effect of ramipril was similar in patients with normotension and  hypertension. Hypertensive patients and those with proteinuria of 2 g/24 h or  greater of protein, primary glomerular disease, or nephrosclerosis gained the  most from ACE inhibitor treatment. During the study period, those with  proteinuria less than 2 g/24 h of protein, type 2 diabetes, or polycystic kidney  disease did not benefit by treatment to an appreciable extent.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of increased of laryngeal mask airway (LMA) intracuff pressures on the laryngopharyngeal mucosa. STUDY DESIGN: Animal model.  METHODS: Sixteen mixed-breed dogs were randomly allocated to two groups, G1  (intracuff volume, 30 mL; n = 8) and G2 (intracuff volume, 54 mL; n = 8), to  produce, respectively, high or very high intracuff pressures. Anesthesia was  induced and maintained with pentobarbital. Intracuff pressures were measured  immediately after insertion and inflation of a No. 4 laryngeal mask airway (LMA)  and 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes thereafter. The dogs were euthanized, and biopsy  specimens from eight predetermined areas of the laryngopharynx in contact with  LMA cuff were collected for light microscopic (LM) and scanning electron  microscopic (SEM) examination. RESULTS: Initial LMA cuff inflation in G1 and G2  resulted in intracuff pressures of 119 mm Hg +/- 4 mm Hg and 235 mm Hg +/- 13 mm  Hg, respectively. Over a 2-hour period, the intracuff pressure decreased  significantly in G1 (P < .001) and G2 (P < .01), and there was a significant  difference between the groups over time (P < .001). The LM study of  laryngopharyngeal mucosa in both groups showed mild congestion in the  subepithelial layer. There were no differences between the groups (P > .10) or  among the areas sampled (P > .10). In some areas of G2, the SEM study showed  epithelial desquamation that was more intense than that in G1. CONCLUSIONS: The  increase in LMA intracuff pressure caused only mild alterations in the  laryngopharyngeal mucosa of the dog.

AB  - Ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, a major problem in clinical lung transplantation, is associated with surfactant dysfunction. The present study  aimed to test the hypothesis that preservation related improvements in  post-ischaemic lung function are associated with improved ultrastructural  preservation of pulmonary surfactant. Rat lungs were flush perfused with modified  Euro-Collins solutions (ECS), stored for 2 h at 4 degrees C, and reperfused for  40 min. Lungs were preserved with conventional (ECS 115: 115 mmol x L(-1) K+),  medium-K+ (ECS 40: 40 mmol x L(-1) K+), or low-K+ (ECS 10: 10 mmol x L(-1) K+)  ECS. Functional parameters were monitored during reperfusion (n=10 per group).  After reperfusion, left lungs were prepared for electron microscopical and  stereological analysis of surfactant (n=5 per group). In all three experimental  groups notable I/R injury developed which was lowest in ECS 40 as indicated by  significantly less intraalveolar oedema, higher perfusate oxygenation, and lower  peak inspiratory pressure. This was associated with a significantly superior  preservation of the ultrastructure of the surface active surfactant subtype  tubular myelin in ECS 40 compared with ECS 115 and ECS 10. Stereological analysis  revealed that the relative amount of tubular myelin was highest in ECS 40  (mean+/-SEM; 6.2+/-0.8%) compared with ECS 115 (3.0+/-1.0%) and ECS 10  (2.7+/-1.6%). Analysis of surfactant in its natural location within the organ  showed that the severity of ischaemia/reperfusion injury correlates with  differences in intraalveolar surfactant composition. Improved post-ischaemic  respiratory function achieved by medium-K+ Euro-Collins solution is associated  with superior ultrastructural preservation of tubular myelin. It is concluded  that the integrity of surface active tubular myelin represents an important  criterion for the assessment of lung preservation quality.

AB  - While injuries due to a hypoxic state commonly appear later in both intestinal crypts and basal portion of the villi than in the apical portion, a  nonhomogeneous distribution of blood flow in the intestinal mucosa may be  supposed. The presence of two different microvascular plexuses inside the mucosa,  corresponding to the cryptal plexus and the villous plexus, supports the above  hypothesis. This work studies the intestinal microvasculature in shocked versus  normal rats. Forty-five rats were divided into four groups to study the  histological damage and the microvascular bed by ink injection, fluorescent  microsphere infusion, and resin injection for scanning electron microscopy (SEM)  of vascular corrosion cast (VCC) observations. An infusion pressure of 100 +/- 5  mm Hg was used in control animals, while 30 +/- 5 mm Hg infusion pressure was  adopted for controls as well as for shocked animals to simulate physiological or  shock conditions. Hemorrhagic shock was induced by removing blood and maintaining  a mean arterial pressure of 30 +/- 5 mm Hg for 45-120 mins. A close connection  among the patterns of microvasculature obtained with VCC and ink injection  technique can be appreciated. In normal rats the whole microvasculature was  visualized, but in both normal and shocked animals injected at low pressure  different patterns could be found, generally showing a highly incomplete  visualization of the vascular network. A significant decrease of visualization of  both the entire microvasculature and the villous plexus is present in shocked  animals when compared to unshocked controls, while no difference in the cryptal  plexus visualization was observed. These observations suggest that the cryptal  plexus is perfused preferentially during hemorrhagic shock, as a consequence of  its peculiar microvascular organization. This may explain the relative resistance  of the crypts, compared to villi, to hypoxic injuries in order to sustain  endocrine function and the regenerative capability of the mucosa after prolonged  hypoperfusion conditions that can lead to villous damage and temporary loss of  the intestinal barrier function.

AB  - Pharmacokinetic responses to oral doses of the dipeptide, L-alanyl-glutamine (Ala-Gln), were evaluated after a single, bolus load or an intermittent dosing in  normal healthy subjects (n = 8) to find the optimal mode of oral administration.  In a subgroup (n = 4) of the healthy subjects, the influence of a gastric acid  suppressor (Omeprazole) was investigated. The influence of an acute episode of  classic Dengue fever was examined in eight patients. All modes of administration  to healthy subjects significantly increased free plasma Gln and alanine  concentrations. Peak increments of plasma Gln concentration were 794+/-107  micromol/L (mean +/- SEM) after bolus intake of 20 g of Ala-Gln and 398+/-61  micromol/L after intermittent intake of the same cumulative dosage of the  dipeptide (P<0.01). After intermittent dosing, the maximum peak increase appeared  significantly later (P<0.01). Areas under the curve (AUC), expressing the  integrated responses over time of plasma free Gln and alanine concentrations, did  not differ after bolus and intermittent loads of Ala-Gln. Pretreatment with the  acid suppressor, Omeprazole, did not influence Gln (P = 0.79) or alanine (P =  0.90) plasma increment. Dengue patients manifested the same pharmacokinetic  responses to a 20 g Ala-Gln bolus as healthy controls. In general, on a  micromolar concentration basis, Gln and alanine followed parallel tracks in terms  of plasma appearance, clearance and elimination after the oral administration of  20 g of the Ala-Gln dipeptide through the range of conditions and dosing  protocols explored here.

AB  - Free oxygen radicals and intracellular calcium homeostasis play important roles in the development of myocardial reperfusion injury. Propofol is a radical  scavenger with calcium channel blocking properties. We have investigated the  effects of propofol on myocardial reperfusion injury. We used an isolated rat  heart model where heart rate, ventricular volume and perfusion pressure were  constant. The left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) was occluded for 30  min and reperfused for 2 h. We studied an untreated control group, an Intralipid  group (1 microliter ml-1) and a propofol group (Intralipid 1 microliter ml-1 and  propofol 1 microgram ml-1) (n = 12 each). Drugs were infused for 20 min starting  5 min before reperfusion. We measured left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP),  coronary flow and infarct size. LAD occlusion reduced mean LVDP from 129 (SEM 4)  to 36 (3) mm Hg and mean coronary flow from 12.2 (0.3) to 5.2 (0.2) ml min-1.  During reperfusion, LVDP recovered to 98 (4) mm Hg and coronary flow to 11.9  (0.4) ml min-1. Haemodynamic variables were similar in all groups. Propofol had  no effect on infarct size compared with the Intralipid group (25.0 (3.7) vs 26.9  (3.3)% of the area at risk; P = 0.89). Infarct size in the Intralipid group  tended to be smaller compared with the control group (34.8 (3.2)%; P = 0.19). We  conclude that propofol, at a clinically relevant concentration, provided no  protective effect against myocardial reperfusion injury in the rat heart in  vitro.

AB  - This study sought to determine whether gallium-desferrioxamine (Ga/DFO) can curb free radical formation and mitigate biochemical and electrophysiological  parameters of injury in the cat retina subjected to ischemia followed by  reperfusion. For the biochemical studies, cat eyes were subjected to 90 min of  retinal ischemia followed by 5 min of reperfusion, and enucleation of one eye of  each cat was used to measure retinal reperfusion injury. Before enucleation of  fellow eyes, 2.5 mg/kg Ga/DFO was injected intravenously 5 min before  reperfusion. The flux of hydroxyl radicals, as measured directly by conversion of  salicylate to 2,3- and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,3- and 2,5-DHBA), was  significantly lower in Ga/DFO-treated eyes. The mean normalized level of 2,3-DHBA  (considered a specific marker of hydroxyl radicals) was 3.5 times higher in  untreated eyes. Ga/DFO caused a significant reduction, by 2.56-fold, in lipid  peroxidation, as reflected by levels of malondialdehyde. Ascorbic acid, a natural  antioxidant present in the retina, is severely depleted in untreated eyes. In  contrast, in Ga/DFO-treated eyes, levels were 10 times higher than the control.  Energy charge was 2.38 times higher in treated eyes. Levels of purine catabolites  (hypoxanthine, xanthine, and uric acid) that reflect excessive metabolism of  purine nucleotides were approximately twice higher in untreated retinas.  Electroretionographic studies, performed on a different subset of animals,  substantiated the biochemical results. In Ga/DFO-treated eyes the amplitude of  the mixed cone-rod response b-wave (as compared with fellow nonischemic eyes)  fully recovered within 24 h after ischemia (b-wave ratio 1.04 +/- 0.09, [mean +/-  SEM]) whereas ischemic/reperfused and nontreated eyes recovered to only 0.33 +/-  0. 05. The results show that severe biochemical and functional retinal injury  occurs in cat eyes subjected to ischemia and reperfusion. These severe changes  were significantly reduced by a single administration of Ga/DFO just before  reperfusion. We hypothesize that the protection afforded by Ga/DFO is due to a  combined effect of "Push-Pull" mechanisms interfering with transition  metal-dependent and free radical-mediated injurious processes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In skeletal muscle, dantrolene reduces free cytosolic calcium by inhibiting calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. A similar effect in  ischemic-reperfused heart cells would protect myocardial tissue against  reperfusion injury. We tested the hypothesis that dantrolene infusion during  reperfusion protects the heart against reperfusion injury. METHODS: Isovolumetric  beating rat hearts were subjected to 30 min of ischemia followed by 60 min of  reperfusion. Left ventricular (LV) developed pressure (LVDP) and creatine kinase  release (CKR) were determined as indices of myocardial performance and cellular  injury, respectively. In the treatment groups, dantrolene (25 (DAN25) or 100  (DAN100) micromol l(-1)) was infused during the first 15 min of reperfusion;  control hearts received the respective concentration of the vehicle (mannitol  (CON25, CON100), each group n=7). To investigate the effects of dantrolene on  reperfusion injury in vivo, 18 chloralose-anesthetized rabbits were subjected to  30 min occlusion and 180 min reperfusion of a major coronary artery. LV pressure  (LVP), cardiac output (CO), and infarct size were determined. During the last 5  min of ischemia, nine rabbits received 10 mg kg(-1) dantrolene intravenously  (DAN). Another nine rabbits received the vehicle (dimethylsulfoxide) and served  as controls (CON). RESULTS: In isolated rat hearts, there was no recovery of LVDP  in any group. Total CKR during 1 h of reperfusion was 845+/-76 (CON100) and  550+/-81 U g(-1) dry mass (DAN100, P<0.05). In rabbits in vivo, hemodynamic  baseline values were similar between groups (CON vs. DAN: LVP, 99+/-6  (mean+/-SEM) vs. 91+/-6mm Hg, P=0.29; CO, 252+/-26 vs. 275+/-23 ml min(-1), P=  0.53). During coronary artery occlusion, LVP and CO were reduced in both groups  (CON: LVP, 89+/-3%; CO, 90+/-5% of baseline values) and LVP did not recover to  baseline values during reperfusion (51+/-5% (CON) vs. 67+/-7% (DAN) of baseline,  P=0.10). Infarct size was 41+/-4% of the area at risk in controls and 37+/-6% in  dantrolene treated hearts (P=0.59). CONCLUSIONS: Dantrolene reduced CKR,  indicating an attenuation of lethal cellular reperfusion injury in isolated rat  hearts. However, in the rabbit in vivo, there was no effect on the extent of  reperfusion injury after regional myocardial ischemia.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Saphenous vein graft failures, resulting from thrombosis and the abnormal proliferation, migration and apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells  (VSMC) are major limitations of coronary artery bypass surgery. We investigated  whether surgical trauma of human saphenous vein induces the early response gene  c-fos and causes alterations in rates of proliferation and apoptosis. METHODS:  Surgically prepared human vein consisted of distended (at 350 mmHg for 2 min) or  non-distended segments of vein maintained in serum free RPMI at 37 degrees C and  5% CO2 for various time intervals. c-fos expression was detected by Northern  analysis. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were determined by [3H]thymidine  incorporation combined with proliferation cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)  immunostaining and TUNEL, respectively. Labelling indices for proliferation and  apoptosis were correlated with vessel was thicknesses. RESULTS: Control, freshly  isolated vein expressed no c-fos. Surgically prepared vein synthesized c-fos 1 h  following harvesting. There was a significant increase in c-fos in distended  compared to non-distended vein. c-Fos protein increased in surgically prepared  vein 24 h after harvesting. There was a significant increase in vascular cell  proliferation in the non-distended compared to the distended vein: mean (S.E.M.)  1279 (218) vs. 863 (155) dpm/microgram DNA, P < 0.05, n = 6. In addition, the  apoptotic index was significantly lower in the media of non-distended vs.  distended vein 0.82 (0.2) vs. 5.5 (1.5), P < 0.05, n = 5. CONCLUSIONS: These  findings demonstrate that surgical preparation of human saphenous vein increases  expression of c-fos mRNA and apoptosis and reduces proliferation when compared  with non-distended vein. These changes may influence the failure of saphenous  vein grafts.

AB  - The role of nitric oxide (NO) in ischemic renal injury is still controversial. NO release was measured in rat kidneys subjected to ischemia and reperfusion to  determine whether (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-L-biopterin (BH4), a cofactor of NO  synthase (NOS), reduces ischemic injury. Twenty-four hours after bilateral renal  arterial clamp for 45 min, acetylcholine-induced vasorelaxation and NO release  were reduced and renal excretory function was impaired in Wistar rats.  Administration of BH4 (20 mg/kg, by mouth) before clamping resulted in a marked  improvement of those parameters (10(-8) M acetylcholine, delta renal perfusion  pressure: sham-operated control -45 +/- 5, ischemia -30 +/- 2, ischemia + BH4 -43  +/- 4%; delta NO: control +30 +/- 6, ischemia + 10 +/- 2, ischemia + BH4 +23 +/-  4 fmol/min per g kidney; serum creatinine: control 23 +/- 2, ischemia 150 +/- 27,  ischemia + BH4 48 +/- 6 microM; mean +/- SEM). Most of renal NOS activity was  calcium-dependent, and its activity decreased in the ischemic kidney. However, it  was restored by BH4 (control 5.0 +/- 0.9, ischemia 2.2 +/- 0.4, ischemia + BH4  4.3 +/- 1.2 pmol/min per mg protein). Immunoblot after low-temperature sodium  dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that the dimeric form  of endothelial NOS decreased in the ischemic kidney and that it was restored by  BH4. These results suggest that the decreased activity of endothelium-derived NO  may worsen the ischemic tissue injury, in which depletion of BH4 may be involved.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Several new derivatives of sulphasalazine that make use of its active moiety, 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), have been introduced for the  treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In rats short term intravenous  administration of 5-ASA has been associated with nephrotoxicity. A number of  cases of nephrotoxicity have been reported recently in IBD patients taking oral  maintenance treatment with 5-ASA compounds. OBJECTIVE: To study the urinary and  serum levels of acetylated 5-ASA (Ac-5-ASA) and the unacetylated 5-ASA (5-ASA) in  patients with IBD maintained on sulphasalazine, olsalazine and mesalazine (pH  dependent release form). We also sought correlation between levels of 5-ASA,  clinical disease activity and extent of disease. METHODS: We studied 79 patients  (male, n = 30; female, n = 49) with established IBD [ulcerative colitis (UC), n =  48; Crohn's disease (CD), n = 31], 72 maintained on 5-ASA compounds  (sulphasalazine = 27; olsalazine = 28; mesalazine = 17) and 7 patients were  receiving no medication. Urinary and serum analysis of 5-ASA was performed by  high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Clinical disease activity was  quantified using simple index of Harvey and Bradshaw. RESULTS: Patients receiving  mesalazine had significantly higher levels of serum free 5-ASA compared to those  who were receiving olsalazine and sulphasalazine (mesalazine mean +/- SEM; range;  2.84 +/- 1.21 (0.00-16.00) vs olsalazine 0.45 +/- 0.18 (0.00-16.20); mumol/L; p <  0.04; sulphasalazine 0.37 +/- 0.25 (0.00-3.74); p < 0.03). Similarly levels of  urinary free 5-ASA were significantly higher in patients maintained on mesalazine  compared to those on olsalazine or sulphasalazine (mesalazine 219 +/- 80.43  (0.00-1050) vs olsalazine 33.3 +/- 17.23 (0.00-317) mumol/L; p < 0.01; and  sulphasalazine 15 +/- 8.86 (0.00-192); p < 0.05). However, no significant  difference was observed in the levels of urinary free 5-ASA between olsalazine  and sulphasalazine. No significant difference was observed in the levels of  free-5-ASA in UC patients with left sided disease and those with extensive  disease. Furthermore, no significant difference was observed in the levels of  serum and urinary 5-ASA in CD patients with ileo-colic disease and colonic  disease. Urinary and serum free-5-ASA did not correlate with the clinical disease  activity. CONCLUSION: Systemic absorption of 5-ASA from sulphasalazine and  olsalazine is relatively low. However, pH-dependent mesalazine formulations may  release their contents rapidly in the small intestine and proximal colon  resulting in higher plasma and urinary concentrations of free 5-ASA. The effects  of free 5-ASA on renal function in the human require further evaluation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Inhaled nitric oxide (NO) is a rapidly acting selective pulmonary vasodilator that partially reverses the pathophysiology of acute respiratory  distress syndrome (ARDS). METHODS: After human studies approval, we studied 11  burned children with severe ARDS in a trial of inhaled NO therapy, assessing its  effect on intrapulmonary shunt as measured by the PaO2/FiO2 ratio (PFR). There  were 12 episodes of administration; 1 child was treated twice. RESULTS: The  children had an average age of 8.3 +/- 4.8 years (mean +/- SEM, range 11 months  to 14 years) and average burn size of 64% +/- 22%. At the time of enrollment, the  PFR averaged 95 +/- 50 and Murray lung score 3.1 +/- 0.5. Inhaled NO was begun an  average of 6.3 +/- 5.5 days after injury and was administered for an average of  7.8 +/- 7.2 days at an average dose of 6.7 +/- 2.4 parts per million. PFR  improved an average of 162% +/- 214%. Eight of the 11 children (73%) survived.  The 3 nonsurvivors had similar admission PFR values (100 +/- 75 versus 93 +/- 44,  P = .089) but a significantly less favorable initial response to inhaled NO, with  a percentage of improvement in PFR at 1 hour after enrollment of 7.3% +/- 6.4%  versus 213% +/- 226% (P = .026). There were no complications related to NO  administration. CONCLUSIONS: Inhaled NO can be safely administered to treat ARDS  in children with acute burns and appears to improve their ventilatory management.  An immediate improvement in PFR with inhaled NO may correlate with survival.

AB  - In the process of developing a model of Escherichia coli endotoxin-induced acute lung injury and shock in specific pathogen-free pigs, the effects of pretreatment  with metyrapone (a cortisol-synthesis inhibitor) were examined. Metyrapone was  administered 1.5 h before start of endotoxin infusion at t = 0 h (MET-ETOX group,  n = 6). At the end of the experiments (t = 4 h) a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)  was performed. Control animals received only endotoxin (CON-ETOX group, n = 6) or  metyrapone (MET-CON group, n = 4). The following results are presented as means  +/- SEM. It was found that metyrapone successfully blocked endogenous cortisol  synthesis (plasma cortisol levels were 41.0 +/- 5.9 nM in MET-ETOX vs. 339.0 +/-  37.7 nM in CON-ETOX at t = 4 h, P <0.01). At t = 4 h the MET-ETOX animals had  substantially increased systemic hypotension compared to the CON-ETOX group (mean  arterial pressure 26.7 +/- 4.3 vs. 77.7 +/- 12.2 mmHg, P <0.01), decreased  dynamic lung compliance (10.9 +/- 0.7 vs. 13.7 +/- 0.6 ml/cmH2O, P <0.01),  increased percentage of BAL neutrophils (28.4 +/- 6.5 vs. 6.6 +/-1.8, P <0.01),  pulmonary edema (BAL total protein 0.82 +/- 0.21 vs. 0.42 +/- 0.09 mg/mL, P  <0.05), elevated levels of interleukin-8 (1924 +/- 275 vs. 324 +/- 131 pg/mL, P  <0.01) and acidosis (pH 7.11 +/- 0.03 vs. 7.23 +/- 0.06, P <0.05). The MET-ETOX  group also showed an increased pulmonary hypertension between 2 and 3 h after  start of endotoxin infusion and a trend toward significantly increased levels of  plasma interleukin-8 (P = 0.052). Arterial pCO2, pO2/FiO2, plasma endothelin-1,  plasma TNFalpha, and blood leukocytes were not markedly influenced by the plasma  cortisol levels. Nitric oxide production did not seem to be altered by endotoxin  infusion in this model, in contrast to other animal studies; this discrepancy  could be thought to be due to endotoxin-dosage differences or species  differences. It is concluded that if endogenous cortisol production is blocked by  metyrapone, the reactions occurring as a result of the endotoxin-induced acute  lung injury and shock are greatly enhanced and that therefore pretreatment with  metyrapone might be an important addition to this model with specific  pathogen-free pigs.

T2  - British journal of anaesthesia
AB  - We have compared the effect of rocuronium and succinylcholine on intraocular pressure (IOP) during rapid sequence induction of anaesthesia using propofol and  fentanyl, in a randomized double-blind study. We studied 30 adult patients,  allocated to one of two groups. Anaesthesia was induced with fentanyl 2  micrograms kg-1 and propofol until loss of verbal response. This was followed by  succinylcholine 1.5 mg kg-1 (group S; n = 15) or rocuronium 0.9 mg kg-1 (group R;  n = 15). Laryngoscopy was performed 60 s later. IOP, mean arterial pressure (MAP)  and heart rate (HR) were measured before induction, immediately before intubation  and every minute after intubation for 5 min. A Keeler Pulsair air impulse  tonometer was used to measure IOP and the mean of two readings obtained in the  right eye at each measurement time was recorded. Intubating conditions were  evaluated according to a simple scoring system. IOP in the succinylcholine group  was significantly greater than that in the rocuronium group (mean 21.6 (SEM 1.4)  mm Hg vs 13.3 (1.4) mm Hg; P < 0.001). Intubating conditions were equally good in  both groups. We conclude that with rapid sequence induction of anaesthesia using  propofol and fentanyl, rocuronium did not cause as great an increase in IOP as  succinylcholine and may be an alternative in open eye injury cases.

AB  - HYPOTHESIS: Clinical study can help determine the safety and cardiovascular and systemic effects of an early infusion of 7.5% sodium chloride in 6% dextran-70  (hypertonic saline-dextran-70 [HSD]) given as an adjuvant to a standard  resuscitation with lactated Ringer (RL) solution following severe thermal injury.  DESIGN: Prospective clinical study. SETTING: Intensive care unit of tertiary  referral burn care center. PATIENTS: Eighteen patients with thermal injury over  more than 35% of the total body surface area (TBSA) (range, 36%-71%) were  studied. INTERVENTIONS: Eight patients (mean +/- SEM, 48.2% +/- 2% TBSA) received  a 4-mL/kg HSD infusion approximately 3.5 hours (range, 1.5-5.0 hours) after  thermal injury in addition to routine RL resuscitation. Ten patients (46.0% +/-  6% TBSA) received RL resuscitation alone. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pulmonary artery  catheters were employed to monitor cardiac function, while hemodynamic,  metabolic, and biochemical measurements were taken for 24 hours. RESULTS: Serum  troponin I levels, while detectable in all patients, were significantly lower  after HSD compared with RL alone (mean +/- SEM, 0.45 +/- 0.32 vs 1.35 +/- 0.35  microg/L at 8 hours, 0.88 +/- 0.55 vs 2.21 +/- 0.35 microg/L at 12 hours). While  cardiac output increased proportionately between 4 and 24 hours in both groups  (from 5.79 +/- 0.8 to 9.45 +/- 1.1 L/min [mean +/- SEM] for HSD vs from 5.4 +/-  0.4 to 9.46 +/- 1.22 L/min for RL), filling pressure (central venous pressure and  pulmonary capillary wedge pressure) remained low for 12 hours after HSD infusion  (P = .048). Total fluid requirements at 8 hours (2.76 +/- 0.7 mL/kg per each 1%  TBSA burned [mean +/- SEM] for HSD vs 2.67 +/- 0.24 mL/kg per each 1% TBSA burned  for RL) and 24 hours (6.11 +/- 4.4 vs 6.76 +/- 0.75 mL/kg per each 1% TBSA  burned) were similar. Blood pressure remained unchanged, and serum sodium levels  did not exceed 150 +/- 2 mmol/L (mean +/- SD) in either group. CONCLUSIONS: The  absence of deleterious hemodynamic or metabolic side effects following HSD  infusion in patients with major thermal injury confirms the safety of this  resuscitation strategy. Postburn cardiac dysfunction was demonstrated in all burn  patients through the use of cardiospecific serum markers and pulmonary artery  catheter monitoring. Early administration of HSD after a severe thermal injury  may reduce burn-related cardiac dysfunction, but it had no effect on the volume  of resuscitation or serum biochemistry values.

TI  - Effects of the insurmountable angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist candesartan and the surmountable antagonist losartan on ischemia/reperfusion injury in rat  hearts.
AU  - Wang, Q. D.

T2  - European journal of pharmacology
AB  - Two angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonists with different receptor binding characteristics, candesartan (insurmountable antagonism) and losartan  (surmountable antagonism), were compared as regards their effects on angiotensin  II-induced vasoconstriction and on myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. In  isolated rat hearts perfused under constant flow, it was found that at equipotent  concentrations candesartan (10 nM) and losartan (3 microM) almost completely  inhibited the angiotensin II-induced increase in coronary perfusion pressure.  However, if a washout period was introduced before the angiotensin II challenge,  the effect of losartan quickly vanished, while that of candesartan remained. In  hearts subjected to 25 min of global ischemia and 45 min of reperfusion,  pre-treatment with candesartan (10 nM) or losartan (3 microM) immediately prior  to ischemia improved the recovery of left ventricular developed pressure as  compared to the effect of vehicle (69 +/- 3.2 and 64 +/- 2.3 vs. 44 +/- 6.2%,  respectively; mean +/- S.E.M, P < 0.05). When ischemia was initiated following 30  min of washout after drug administration, the recovery of left ventricular  developed pressure was higher in the candesartan group (73 +/- 3.2%, P < 0.05),  but not in the losartan group (63 +/- 2.8%), than in the vehicle group (58 +/-  4.8%). The cumulative creatine kinase release during the first 30 min of  reperfusion in the washout experiments was lower in the candesartan group (28.5  +/- 2.30 U, P < 0.05), but not in the losartan (40.8 +/- 6.73 U) group, than in  the vehicle group (48.1 +/- 4.35 U). No significant difference between groups in  left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and coronary perfusion pressure was  found. The present results demonstrate that angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonists  at equipotent concentrations could differ in their cardioprotective effects in  hearts subjected to ischemia/reperfusion. It is suggested that the insurmountable  AT1 receptor characteristics of candesartan could provide more persistent  cardioprotection than the surmountable receptor characteristics of losartan.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Like ischemic preconditioning, certain volatile anesthetics have been shown to reduce the magnitude of ischemia/ reperfusion injury via activation of  K+ adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive (K(ATP)) channels. The purpose of this  study was (1) to determine if ischemic preconditioning (IPC) and sevoflurane  preconditioning (SPC) increase nitric oxide release and improve coronary vascular  function, as well as mechanical and electrical function, if given for only brief  intervals before global ischemia of isolated hearts; and (2) to determine if  K(ATP) channel antagonism by glibenclamide (GLB) blunts the cardioprotective  effects of IPC and SPC. METHODS: Guinea pig hearts were isolated and perfused  with Krebs-Ringer's solution at 55 mm Hg and randomly assigned to one of seven  groups: (1) two 2-min total coronary occlusions (preconditioning, IPC)  interspersed with 5 min of normal perfusion; (2) two 2-min occlusions  interspersed with 5 min of perfusion while perfusing with GLB (IPC+GLB); (3) SPC  (3.5%) for two 2-min periods; (4) SPC+GLB for two 2-min periods; (5) no treatment  before ischemia (control [CON]); (6) CON+GLB; and (7) no ischemia (time control).  Six minutes after ending IPC or SPC, hearts of ischemic groups were subjected to  30 min of global ischemia and 75 min of reperfusion. Left-ventricular pressure,  coronary flow, and effluent NO concentration ([NO]) were measured. Flow and NO  responses to bradykinin, and nitroprusside were tested 20-30 min before ischemia  or drug treatment and 30-40 min after reperfusion. RESULTS: After ischemia,  compared with before (percentage change), left-ventricular pressure and coronary  flow, respectively, recovered to a greater extent (P<0.05) after IPC (42%, 77%),  and treatment with SPC (45%, 76%) than after CON (30%, 65%), IPC+GLB (24%, 64%),  SPC+GLB (20%, 65%), and CON+GLB (28%, 64%). Bradykinin and nitroprusside  increased [NO] by 30+/-5 (means +/- SEM) and 29+/-4 nM, respectively, averaged  for all groups before ischemia. [NO] increased by 26+/-6 and 27+/-7 nM,  respectively, in SPC and IPC groups after ischemia, compared with an average [NO]  increase of 8+/-5 nM (P<0.01) after ischemia in CON and each of the three GLB  groups. Flow increases to bradykinin and nitroprusside were also greater after  SPC and IPC. CONCLUSIONS: Preconditioning with sevoflurane, like IPC, improves  not only postischemic contractility, but also basal flow, bradykinin and  nitroprusside-induced increases in flow, and effluent [NO] in isolated hearts.  The protective effects of both SPC and IPC are reversed by K(ATP) channel  antagonism.

AB  - The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that during myocardial ischemia, slowing of the Ca(2+) transient decline causes slowed relaxation. Our  approach was to monitor pressure and Ca(2+) transients in isovolumic rat hearts  during control and low flow ischemia conditions. In addition, we experimentally  slowed the decline of the Ca(2+) transient using cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) to  inhibit the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA, the most important pump  for rapidly transporting Ca(2+) out of the cytosol). Using 9 microm CPA during  normoxia, we were able to reproduce the slowed Ca(2+) transient decline and  slowed relaxation found during low flow ischemia. The time constants of cytosolic  [Ca(2+)] decline and pressure decline (tau(Ca) and tau(P) respectively) with CPA  (78+/-5 ms and 64+/-3 ms) were similar to those found with ischemia (89+/-12 ms  and 72+/-10 ms, mean+/-SEM, n=7) and were considerably greater than for controls  (41+/-3 and 25+/-2 ms, mean+/-SEM, n=14, P<0.01). Furthermore, the relationship  of tau(P) v tau(Ca) with CPA was similar to that found with ischemia. These  findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the slowed Ca(2+) transient  decline with both CPA and ischemia causes slowed relaxation. Consistent with this  conclusion, a simple mathematical model to relate cytosolic [Ca(2+)] and pressure  also suggests that slowed pressure relaxation can be explained by slowing of the  Ca(2+) transient decline. This study suggests that impaired Ca(2+) uptake is a  major injury causing slowed relaxation during ischemia.

AB  - Ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) result in surfactant dysfunction. Whether the impairment of surfactant is a consequence or a cause of intraalveolar edema  formation is still unknown. The cumulative effects of lung perfusion, ischemic  storage, and subsequent reperfusion on surfactant ultrastructure and pulmonary  function were studied in a rat isolated perfused lung model. The left lungs were  fixed for electron microscopy by vascular perfusion either immediately after  excision (control; n = 5) or after perfusion with modified Euro-Collins solution  (EC), storage for 2 h at 4 degrees C in EC, and reperfusion for 40 min (n = 5). A  stereological approach was chosen to discriminate between intraalveolar  surfactant subtypes of edematous regions and regions free of edema. Intraalveolar  edema seen after I/R in the EC group occupied 36 +/- 6% (mean +/- SEM) of the gas  exchange region as compared with control lungs (1 +/- 1%; p = 0.008). Relative  intraalveolar surfactant composition showed a decrease in surface active tubular  myelin (3 +/- 1 versus 12 +/- 0%; p = 0.008) and an increase in inactive  unilamellar forms (83 +/- 2 versus 64 +/- 5%; p = 0.008) in the EC group. These  changes occurred both in edematous (tubular myelin, 3 +/- 1%; unilamellar forms,  88 +/- 6%) and in nonedematous regions (tubular myelin, 4 +/- 3%; unilamellar  forms, 77 +/- 5%). The ultrastructural changes in surfactant were associated with  an increase in peak inspiratory pressure during reperfusion. In conclusion,  surfactant alterations seen after I/R are not directly related to the presence of  edema fluid in the alveoli. Disturbances in intraalveolar surfactant after I/R  are not merely the result of inactivation due to plasma protein leakage but may  instead be responsible for an increased permeability of the blood-air barrier,  resulting in a vicious cycle of intraalveolar edema formation and progressing  surfactant impairment.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine whether plasma von Willebrand factor concentrations are correlated with the degree of intestinal ischaemia-reperfusion  injury. Forty-six anaesthetised adult Wistar rats were divided into five groups.  The sham-operated group (S, n=10) had laparotomy and isolation of the superior  mesenteric artery without clamping. Three ischaemia-reperfusion groups (n=10 in  each) had clamping of the superior mesenteric artery for 15, 30, and 45 minutes,  respectively, and reperfusion for 15 minutes. A control group (C, n=6) had direct  puncture of the heart to sample blood. Mean arterial pressure was measured  continuously. Blood was collected at the end of the study to measure von  Willebrand factor. The small bowel injury was graded histologically. There was a  significant systemic hypotension after declamping in all ischaemia-reperfusion  groups, which had a high negative correlation with the histological score  (R=-0.46, F=10.1, p<0.003, simple linear regression). Plasma von Willebrand  factor was significantly elevated in the three ischaemia-reperfusion groups  compared with the control group but not significantly different from the  sham-operated group (mean von Willebrand factor concentration (SEM): 156 (29),  283 (29), 295 (25), 381 (44), and 366 (40)% in C, S, ischaemia-reperfusion 15,  ischaemia-reperfusion 30, and ischaemia-reperfusion 45 groups, respectively). The  concentration of von Willebrand factor was not correlated to the histological  score (R=0.22, F=1.83, p<0.2) or the degree of hypotension after the removal of  the clamp (R=-0.22, F=1.8, p<0.2, simple linear regression). This study shows  that von Willebrand factor concentration does not correlate with the degree of  intestinal ischaemia-reperfusion injury. It is unlikely that von Willebrand  factor can be used as a predictor of disease severity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Technetium 99m-HL91 is a new hypoxia imaging agent that demonstrates increased uptake in ischemic, viable myocardium. This study was performed to  determine whether HL91 is taken up by nonviable myocardium. METHODS: Twenty-three  Krebs-Henseleit buffer-perfused, isolated rat hearts were studied. Tc-99m-HL91  300 microCi was infused over 10 minutes, followed by a 60-minute clearance.  Myocardial activity was monitored by use of an NaI crystal. Four groups were  studied: control (flow = 12 mL/min, n = 7), low flow (flow = 1 mL/min, n = 6), no  flow/reflow (60 minutes no flow/60 minutes reflow before Tc-99m-HL91 infusion,  flow = 12 mL/min, n = 5), and cyanide-treated (before Tc-99m-HL91 infusion, flow  = 12 mL/min, n = 5). Injury was assessed by creatine kinase, transmission  electron microscopy, and triphenyltetrazolium chloride. RESULTS: Control (no  injury) and cyanide-treated (severe injury) hearts demonstrated low uptake  (6.3+/-0.5 mean+/-SEM and 5.7+/-1.2 microCi, respectively) and low 60-minute  retention (13.8%+/-2.2% and 13.7%+/-3.9%, respectively). Low-flow hearts (minimal  injury) demonstrated markedly increased uptake (43.5+/-2.8 microCi, P < .01) and  increased 60-minute retention (33.2%+/-2.9%, P < .01) compared with control.  No-flow/reflow hearts (moderate injury) demonstrated intermediate uptake  (8.7+/-0.5 microCi, P < .05 to control), although retention was not significantly  different (18.9%+/-3.5%, P = ns). Severely and rapidly injured myocardium  demonstrated Tc-99m-HL91 peak uptake and retention indistinguishable from normal.  Moderately injured myocardium demonstrated uptake intermediate between severely  injured and low-flow-induced ischemic, viable myocardium. CONCLUSION: Thus  Tc-99m-HL91 is not taken up or retained in nonviable and irreversibly injured  myocardium.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Minimal invasive surgery is increasingly used in conditions complicated by peritonitis-e.g., peptic ulcer perforation. This study was devised  to assess the effect of a pneumoperitoneum (PP) on the ultrastructural integrity  of parietal peritoneum in perforation-induced peritonitis. METHODS: Anesthetized  rats were subjected either to standardized gastrotomy simulating gastric  perforation (groups Ia-d; IIa-d) or to sham perforation (groups IIIa-d, IVa-d).  In group I (a-d) and III (a-d), CO2 was insufflated 12 h after gastrotomy for 60  min (Pia 4 mmHg). Glutaraldehyde was administered intraperitoneally at the end of  the PP period while the abdominal wall was still extended (group index a), as  well as 30 sec (b), 2 h (c), and 12 h (d) after desufflation. Specimens were  taken from the parietal peritoneum of the left diaphragm for scanning  electronic-microscopic (SEM) analysis. In groups II (a-d) and IV (a-d), simple  puncture of the abdominal cavity was performed, and specimens were taken at  corresponding times. RESULTS: In group Ia (gastric perforation with PP),  distortion of the mesothelial cell layer with concomittant opening of stomata to  the submesothelial tissue was already observed in specimens harvested while the  abdominal wall was still extended. Concomitantly, scarce microvilli, which  appeared coarse and thickened, were lying flat on top of the mesothelial cells.  After desufflation (groups Ib-c), a rapid process of mesothelial disintegration  with disruption from the submesothelial layer and vanishing of microvilli  occurred. At 12 h after PP (group Id), complete deterioration of mesothelial cell  integrity was observed. In groups IIa-c (gastric perforation without PP),  microvilli appeared shrunk and coarse, while integrity of the mesothelial cell  layer remained intact up to 2 h after the abdominal puncture. At 12 h after  abdominal puncture (group IId), the microvilli had nearly completely vanished and  the mesothelium was breaking apart into multiple soils. CONCLUSIONS: In SEM  analysis of parietal peritoneum, premature distortion, and disintegration of the  mesothelial cell layer was observed in animals exposed to increased abdominal  pressure in addition to gastric perforation-induced peritonitis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In stromal keratitis induced by herpes simplex virus (HSV) the host's immune response contributes to corneal scarring and neovascularization. The  purpose of this study was to analyze the efficacy of topically applied  cyclosporin A (CsA) in patients with HSV keratitis. METHODS: The authors  performed a prospective pilot study in patients with HSV stromal keratitis (n =  18). Eyes were treated with CsA eyedrops and acyclovir ointment. The drugs were  tapered off gradually. Visual acuity, slit-lamp appearance, intraocular pressure  and corneal sensitivity were evaluated monthly (follow-up 5.2+/-0.28 months, mean  +/- SEM. RESULTS: Keratitis resolved with CsA treatment in 10 of 14 patients with  non-necrotizing keratitis and in 2 of 4 with necrotizing keratitis. As CsA was  used topically, the corticosteroids could be withdrawn in all patients with  non-necrotizing keratitis and in 1 of 3 with necrotizing keratitis. Under CsA  therapy, persistent or progressive inflammation was noted in 6 of the 18  patients. These 6 patients with keratitis improved only with combined  CsA/corticosteroids. Corneal ulcers healed in 4 patients with topical CsA, and  corneal neovascularization improved in a further 8. Except for toxic  epitheliopathy, no further CsA complications were noted. CONCLUSIONS: The  findings in this pilot study suggest that HSV stromal keratitis can be treated  successfully with CsA eyedrops, especially in non-necrotizing disease. CsA may be  particularly helpful in the presence of steroid glaucoma, herpetic corneal  ulcers, and to taper off topical corticosteroids. Additional use of acyclovir may  aid in suppressing the recurrence of epithelial HSV keratitis. A randomized study  should be performed to evaluate the role of topical CsA in more detail.

AB  - The contribution of the complement system to cerebral ischemic and ischemia/reperfusion injury was examined in a rabbit model of thromboembolic  stroke by delivery of an autologous clot embolus to the intracranial circulation  via the internal carotid artery. A two-by-two factorial design was employed to  study the impact of complement depletion via pretreatment with cobra venom factor  (CVF, 100 U/kg i.v.) in the setting of permanent (without tissue plasminogen  activator; t-PA) and transient (with t-PA) cerebral ischemia. Thirty-two New  Zealand white rabbits were assigned to one of four groups (n=8, each group):  control without t-PA, control with t-PA, CVF without t-PA and CVF with t-PA. In  the complement intact animals, t-PA administration resulted in an approximate 30%  reduction in infarct size when compared to the group not receiving t-PA  (20.4+/-6.6% of hemisphere area vs. 30.1+/-7.2%; mean+/-SEM). However, infarct  sizes in the complement depleted rabbits, with (30.7+/-8.2%) or without  (30.2+/-7.9%) t-PA, were no different from the control group receiving no  therapy. Similarly, no difference in regional cerebral blood flow or final  intracranial pressure values was noted between any of the four groups. Complement  activation does not appear to be a primary contributor to brain injury in acute  thromboembolic stroke.

AB  - A specific action against myocardial reperfusion injury of the oxygen paradox type was recently characterized for halothane after anoxic perfusion in isolated  rat hearts and isolated cardiomyocytes. In this study, we have characterized the  protective effects of the clinically available inhalation anaesthetics during  reperfusion after ischaemia. In isolated, isovolumically beating rat hearts  perfused at a constant flow (10 ml min-1, PO2 80 kPa) and paced at 350 beat  min-1, we determined left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) and release of  creatine kinase (CKR) as indices of myocardial performance and cellular injury,  respectively. Seven control hearts underwent 30 min of no-flow ischaemia and 1 h  of reperfusion. In the treatment groups, halothane, enflurane, isoflurane,  sevoflurane or desflurane (each group n = 6) was added to the perfusion medium  for the first 30 min of reperfusion at a concentration corresponding to 1.5 MAC  in the rat. In the control group, cellular injury occurred at early reperfusion  (peak CKR 283 (SEM 57) iu litre-1 at 10 min of reperfusion). Peak CKR to the  coronary venous effluent was attenuated by all anaesthetics (halothane group 156  (45), enflurane group 134 (20), sevoflurane group 132 (20), desflurane group 159  (25) iu litre-1; each P < 0.05). Isoflurane did not differ from controls (303  (53) iu litre-1; P = 0.5). In the sevoflurane group, there was a delayed peak CKR  after discontinuation of the anaesthetic at 30 min of reperfusion (260 (34) iu  litre-1). Functional recovery was improved by all anaesthetics, but was seen much  earlier with desflurane (LVDP 28 (3)% of baseline at 5 min reperfusion compared  with halothane (6 (1)%), enflurane (11 (3)%), isoflurane (9 (6)%), sevoflurane  (10 (2)%) and controls (3 (1)% of baseline)). At 30 min of reperfusion, recovery  of LVDP was improved to a similar extent by all anaesthetics (halothane 30 (9)%,  enflurane 36 (9)%, isoflurane 33 (5)%, sevoflurane 30 (5)%, desflurane 36 (4)% of  baseline values) compared with controls (13 (5)%; each P < 0.05). All inhalation  anaesthetics protected against myocardial reperfusion injury, but showed  differences in attenuation of cellular injury and functional recovery. These  differences may suggest different protective mechanisms.

AB  - It is known that volatile anaesthetics protect myocardial tissue against ischaemic and reperfusion injury in vitro. In this investigation, we have  determined the effects of the inhalation anaesthetics, enflurane, isoflurane,  sevoflurane and desflurane, administered only during early reperfusion, on  myocardial reperfusion injury in vivo. Fifty chloralose-anaesthetized rabbits  were subjected to 30 min of occlusion of a major coronary artery followed by 120  min of reperfusion. Left ventricular pressure (LVP, tip-manometer), cardiac  output (CO, ultrasonic flow probe) and infarct size (triphenyltetrazolium  staining) were determined. During the first 15 min of reperfusion, five groups of  10 rabbits each received 1 MAC of enflurane (enflurane group), isoflurane  (isoflurane group), sevoflurane (sevoflurane group) or desflurane (desflurane  group), and 10 rabbits served as untreated controls (control group). Haemodynamic  baseline values were similar between groups (mean LVP 106 (SEM 2) mm Hg; CO  281(7) ml min-1). During coronary occlusion, LVP and CO were reduced to the same  extent in all groups (LVP 89% of baseline; CO 89%). Administration of inhalation  anaesthetics during early reperfusion further reduced both variables, but they  recovered after discontinuation of the anaesthetics to values not different from  control animals. Infarct size was reduced from 49 (5)% of the area at risk in the  control group to 32 (3)% in the desflurane group (P = 0.021), and to 36 (2)% in  the sevoflurane group (P = 0.097). In the enflurane group, infarct size was 39  (5)% (P = 0.272). Isoflurane had no effect on infarct size (48 (5)%, P = 1.000).  The results show that desflurane and sevoflurane markedly reduced infarct size  and therefore can protect myocardium against reperfusion injury in vivo.  Enflurane had only a marginal effect and isoflurane offered no protection against  reperfusion injury in vivo. These different effects suggest different protective  mechanisms at the cellular level.

AB  - The objective of this study was to examine the role of chloride (Cl-) channels in the myocardial protection of ischemic preconditioning (IP). Isolated rabbit  ventricular myocytes were preconditioned with 10-minute simulated ischemia (SI)  and 20-minute simulated reperfusion (SR) or not preconditioned (control). The  myocytes then received 180-minute SI or 45-minute SI/120-minute SR.  Indanyloxyacetic acid 94 (IAA-94, 10 micromol/L) or  5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid (NPPB, 1 micromol/L) was administered  before IP or before SI or SI/SR to inhibit Cl- channels. Electrophysiological  studies indicate that these drugs, at the concentrations used, selectively  abolished Cl- currents activated under hypo-osmotic conditions (215 versus 290  mOsm). IP significantly (P<0.001) reduced the percentage of dead myocytes after  60-minute (30.8+/-1.3%, mean+/-SEM), 90-minute (35.3+/-1.3%), and 120-minute  (39.2+/-1.7%) SI compared with controls (44.7+/-1.6%, 54.5+/-1.3%, and  58.9+/-1.8%, respectively) and after 45-minute SI/120-minute SR (36.3+/-0.6%)  compared with control (56.6+/-2.2%). Hypo-osmotic stress also produced protection  similar to IP. IAA-94 or NPPB abolished the protection of both IP and  hypo-osmotic stress. In buffer-perfused rabbit hearts preconditioned with three  5-minute ischemia/10-minute reperfusion cycles given before the 40-minute long  ischemia and 60-minute reperfusion, IP significantly (P<0.0001) reduced infarct  size (IP+vehicle, 4.7+/-0.9%, versus control+vehicle, 26.6+/-3.3%; mean+/-SEM).  Again, IAA-94 or NPPB abolished the protection of IP. Our results implicate Cl-  channels in the IP protection of the myocardium against ischemic/reperfusion  injury and demonstrate that hypo-osmotic stress is capable of preconditioning  cardiomyocytes.

AB  - This study describes the advantages and disadvantages of several forms of enteral nutrition for patients with severe head injury (Glasgow Coma Scale Score [GCS],  <12). Included in the study are nasoenteric nutrition delivery using blind,  endoscopic, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and PEG with jejeunostomy  (PEG/J), and open jejeunostomy tube placement methods. These methods are compared  with parenteral delivery of nutrition. The study constituted a retrospective  analysis of the success rate of early enteral feedings by blind, endoscopic PEG  and PEG/J and by open jejeunostomy placement of small-bowel feeding tubes for 57  patients with severe head injury. The delivery cost of enteral nutrition per  intensive care unit day was compared to the delivery cost of parenteral nutrition  per intensive care unit day in the same group of patients. Fifty-three percent of  patients were adequately maintained nutritionally with nasoenteric delivery alone  and did not require parenteral feeding. The average number of days for initiation  of either enteral or parenteral feedings was 1.8 +/- 0.2 days from injury  [standard error of mean (SEM); range, 0-10 days]. An average of 3.3 days (range,  0-23 days) was required for feeding tube placement in all patients. For 70% of  patients, tube placement was completed within 48 h after injury. Full-strength,  full-rate enteral feedings were achieved by a mean of 4.9 days after injury. A  total of 128 feeding tubes were placed while the patients were in the intensive  care unit (ICU; 2.2 +/- 0.2 tubes per patient). Blind placement of feeding tubes  into the small bowel was rarely achieved without repositioning. Endoscopic tube  placement into the duodenum was achieved in 50% of patients, into the jejunum for  33% of patients, and into the stomach for 18% of patients. While in the intensive  care unit, patients received an average of 77 +/- 2% of their measured energy  expenditure (range, 57-114%). Eleven percent of patients experienced severe  gastrointestinal problems. Other problems were associated with the inability to  achieve or maintain access: dislodged tubes (30%), clogged or kinked tubes (21%),  and mechanical access problems (7 %). Seventy-one percent of patients in  barbiturate coma were able to tolerate early nasoenteric feedings. Aspiration  pneumonitis occurred equally among patients fed nasogastrically and those fed  nasoenterically. The overall aspiration rate was 14%. The cost of acute enteral  feeding was $170 per day and that for parenteral feeding, $308 per day. We  conclude that blind transpyloric feeding tube placement is difficult to achieve  in patients with severe head injury; endoscopically guided placement is a better  option. Endoscopic feeding tube placement most consistently allows for early  enteral nutritional support in severe head injured patients. Limitations include  the inability to establish and/or maintain enteral access, increased intracranial  pressure, unstable cervical spinal injuries, facial fractures, and dedication of  the physician to tube placement and monitoring.

T2  - Archives of disease in childhood
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) is a potential therapeutic agent for the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Concerns remain,  however, regarding the potential toxicity from iNO and/or its oxidative  derivatives and methaemoglobinaemia. AIMS: To determine the risk of toxicity from  iNO, which includes worsening of lung injury, a prospective study evaluating the  acute effects of three concentrations of iNO on gas exchange and haemodynamics in  12 children with ARDS was performed in a tertiary paediatric intensive care unit.  INTERVENTION: iNO was administered for one hour at three concentrations (1, 10,  and 20 parts per million (ppm)) in a random order of possible dosing schedules to  avoid dose accumulation bias. Arterial blood gas, methaemoglobin concentrations,  and haemodynamic parameters were obtained at baseline before commencement of iNO,  at the end of each study hour, and after iNO was discontinued. Nitric oxide and  nitrogen dioxide concentrations were continuously monitored during the study.  RESULTS: iNO significantly improved the oxygenation ratio (Pao2/Fio2) from a mean  (SEM) baseline of 11.9 (1.7) kPa to 20 (3.9) kPa, 24 (4.5) kPa, and 21.6 (3.9)  kPa at 1, 10, and 20 ppm iNO, respectively. There was no significant difference  in the improvement in oxygenation achieved between the three concentrations.  Correspondingly, there was a significant improvement in oxygenation index  (pre-iNO 28.3 (5) v post-iNO 18 (3) (1 ppm), 15 (3) (10 ppm), 16 (3) (20 ppm)).  No toxicity from methaemoglobinaemia or nitrogen dioxide was seen during iNO  administration. CONCLUSION: The results show that a low concentration of iNO (1  ppm) is as effective as higher concentrations (10 and 20 ppm) in improving  oxygenation in children with ARDS and may be important in minimising toxicity  during iNO use.

T2  - Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics
AB  - BACKGROUND: There have been reports of nephrotoxic reactions in patients with ulcerative colitis treated with 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) preparations. AIM:  To compare the efficacy in delivery of active 5-ASA to the colon and the systemic  load as the basis for potential long-term toxicity during treatment with  olsalazine or mesalazine in patients with ulcerative colitis in remission.  PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients with ulcerative colitis were treated with  olsalazine or mesalazine, each for 7 days in an open, randomized, crossover  design study. 5-ASA and acetyl-5-ASA (Ac-5-ASA) in plasma and urine were measured  by high performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: The plasma concentration of  5-ASA was 1.2 +/- 0.1 micromol/L (mean +/- S.E.M.) for olsalazine and 8.0 +/- 1.9  micromol/L for mesalazine, while the plasma concentration of Ac-5-ASA was 2.8 +/-  0.2 micromol/L for olsalazine and 10.8 +/- 1.6 micromol/L for mesalazine. The  amount of 5-ASA excreted in the urine was 68 +/- 30 micromol/24 h for olsalazine  and 593 +/- 164 micromol/24 h for mesalazine. The amount of Ac-5-ASA in the urine  was 1260 +/- 102 micromol/24 h for olsalazine and 3223 +/- 229 micromol/24 h for  mesalazine. The urinary recovery of total 5-ASA plus Ac-5-ASA (as a percentage of  the given dose) was 23 +/- 2.1% for olsalazine and 39 +/- 3.6% for mesalazine.  The ratio between the plasma concentrations of mesalazine and olsalazine differed  significantly both for 5-ASA (5.1) and Ac-5-ASA (3.6); for 5-ASA (9. 9) and  Ac-5-ASA (2.6) in urine, and for the urinary recovery of total 5-ASA plus  Ac-5-ASA (1.7). Moreover, in the mesalazine group there was a large variation in  the individual plasma concentrations of 5-ASA and Ac-5-ASA, with maximal values  5-6-fold higher than that in the olsalazine group. CONCLUSION: The systemic load  of active 5-ASA is significantly higher for mesalazine than for olsalazine, when  based on the dosages given and when calculated on an equimolar basis. Some of the  patients in the mesalazine group showed unexpected high levels of plasma and  urinary 5-ASA concentrations, a finding which may have long-term safety  implications.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The main purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy and reliability of the Queen Alexandra Pressure Measurement System (QA PMS).  Furthermore, we examined whether there were significant differences in measured  pressures of the buttock area during sitting between normal subjects and spinal  cord injured (SCI) patients. DESIGN: Accuracy (calibration) and reliability  (test-retest) study. SETTING: The spinal cord unit of Tertiary Care Centre 'De  Hoogstraat' in Utrecht, The Netherlands. PATIENTS: A convenience sample of 16 SCI  patients and 15 normal subjects. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The accuracy was  determined by using the Standard Error of the Mean (SEM, in mmHg). The Technical  Error of Measurement (TEM, in mmHg) was calculated as measure for differences  between two paired measurements. The reliability was determined by using an  Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC). Significant differences in measured  pressures between both groups (P<0.05) were determined by using an unpaired (two  sample) t-test. RESULTS: Accuracy (calibration): mean SEM=0.30 (+/-0.1) mmHg,  indicating a high level of accuracy. Differences between two paired measurements:  mean TEM calibration= 1.87 (+/-0.76) mmHg; mean TEM normal subjects=4.76  (+/-1.78) mmHg; mean TEM SCI patients=6.34 (+/-2.19) mmHg. Reliability: mean  ICC(3,1) calibration=0.85 (95% CI=0.74 0.95); mean ICC(2.1) normal subjects=0.92  (95% CI=0.90 0.94); mean ICC(2.1) SCI patients=0.90 (95% CI=0.88 0.92). The  normal subjects had significantly higher mean pressures (P=0.028) than the SCI  patients (mean pressures 31.0 vs 28.5 mmHg), whilst the SCI patients had  significantly higher peak-pressures (P=0.0000) than the normal subjects (mean  peak-pressures: 134.1 vs 75.7 mmHg). CONCLUSIONS: The QA Pressure Measurement  System has sufficient accuracy and good reliability as a measurement procedure.  There are significant differences between the measured pressures of both groups:  the significantly higher peak pressures of the SCI patients seem to be the most  important.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Changes in pulmonary blood flow rate can alter the size of the perfused pulmonary capillary surface area. We tested the hypothesis that full  recruitment of the pulmonary vascular bed may decrease evidence of lung injury by  recruiting less injured capillaries. We also tested the hypothesis that  endothelial ectoenzyme activity is an earlier indicator of lung injury than are  permeability measures. DESIGN: Isolated canine lung lobes were perfused with  autologous blood at constant blood flows of either 2.05+/-0.04 L/min (SEM) (high  flow, full recruitment, n = 12) or 0.600 +/- 0.004 L/min (low flow, 33% full  recruitment, n = 12) after lung injury to determine the effect of vascular  recruitment on measures of injury. SETTING: Research laboratory at a medical  university. SUBJECTS: Lung lobes were obtained from 36 mongrel dogs of either  gender. INTERVENTIONS: Lung injury was induced by adding phorbol myristate  acetate (PMA) to the blood perfusing the isolated lung. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN  RESULTS: Indicator dilution methods were used to measure single pass hydrolysis  of 3[H]-benzoyl-Phe-Ala-Pro, a synthetic substrate for angiotensin converting  enzyme, and calculate the modified first order kinetic parameter corresponding to  the ratio of a normalized maximal enzymatic conversion rate (A(max)) to the  Michaelis-Menten constant (K(m)), i.e., A(max)/K(m), before and after PMA. At a  given flow rate, the decrease in A(max)/K(m)serves as an index of vascular  injury. PMA decreased A(max)/K(m), percent metabolism, and fractional substrate  utilization, and increased permeability, vascular resistance, and vascular  pressures regardless of flow rate. The decrease in enzyme activity was detected  earlier than the increase in permeability. CONCLUSION: The greater percentage  decrease in percent metabolism and fractional substrate utilization and the  earlier appearance of increased permeability during high flow indicates that  increasing blood flow three-fold recruited injured vessels and/or increased  vascular injury by increasing vascular perfusion pressures.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We conducted this study to determine whether the dry fibrin sealant dressing (DFSD) would stop bleeding from a grade V liver injury and to evaluate  the effects of leaving the absorbable DFSD in survival animals. METHODS:  Twenty-four swine (40+/-3.0 kg) received a uniform grade V liver injury and were  randomized to one of four 1-hour treatment groups: (1) gauze packing, (2) DFSD,  (3) immunoglobulin G placebo dressing, and (4) no treatment. All animals were  resuscitated with lactated Ringer's solution. Total blood loss (TBL), mean  arterial pressure, resuscitation volume, and laboratory data were monitored for 1  hour after injury. Four swine were treated with the DFSD after grade V injury and  allowed to survive for 7 or 14 days. RESULTS: The TBL was 1,104+/-264 mL (mean  +/- SEM), 544+/-104 mL, 4,223+/-1,555 mL, and 6,026+/-1,020 mL for groups 1, 2,  3, and 4 respectively. TBL in DFSD animals was less than that in animals treated  with gauze packing (p = 0.06). Grade V injuries were uniform among the 1-hour  groups, and no evidence of intrahepatic abscess, unusual adhesions, or hepatic  vein, vena caval, or pulmonary thromboses were noted in the long-term survival  animals. CONCLUSION: In this model of grade V liver injury, blood loss with the  DFSD was 51% of that observed with standard gauze packing (not statistically  different). Initial survival data revealed no complications attributable to the  fibrin dressing. DFSD may provide simple, rapid, and definitive hemorrhage  control in life-threatening liver injuries without the need for reoperation.

AB  - The mechanisms for the vascular actions of vasodilatory beta-blockers remain undetermined. For some kinds of beta-blockers, the involvement of nitric oxide  (NO) has been suggested. We studied the effects of vasodilatory beta-blockers on  renal perfusion pressure (RPP) and NO release in the rat kidney. Infusion of  bopindolol, celiprolol, and nebivolol caused a dose-dependent reduction in RPP  and an increase in NO release (RPP: bopindolol 10(-6) mol/L, -23+/-2%; celiprolol  10(-4) mol/L, -27+/-2%; nebivolol 10(-5) mol/L, -35+/-3%; NO: bopindolol 10(-6)  mol/L, +33+/-2; celiprolol 10(-4) mol/L, +41+/-2; nebivolol 10(-5) mol/L, +45+/-5  fmol. min-1. g kidney-1, mean+/-SEM). Metergoline (10(-6) mol/L), a  5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)1/2 antagonist, or NAN-190 (10(-6) mol/L), a 5-HT1A  antagonist, almost completely abolished the vasorelaxation and NO release caused  by bopindolol, celiprolol, and nebivolol. However, neither propranolol nor  bisoprolol decreased RPP. Celiprolol and nebivolol caused vasodilation in the rat  thoracic aorta, and it was markedly reduced by endothelial denudation,  Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (10(-4) mol/L), or NAN-190 (10(-6) mol/L).  In deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt hypertensive rats, 4-week administration of  celiprolol (50 mg. kg-1. d-1 IV) restored the responses regarding RPP and NO  release to acetylcholine. These results suggest that several beta-blockers exert  their vasodilatory action through the 5-HT1A receptor/NO pathway and that  treatment with these beta-blockers may protect against endothelial injury in  hypertension.

AB  - The effects of a highly selective Na+/H+ exchange inhibitor cariporide on the reperfused in situ heart were assessed. Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats weighing  200-300 g were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (60 mg/kg, i.p.) and  divided into four groups; sham-operated (n = 6), vehicle (n = 15), 0.1 mg/kg (n =  15), and 1.0 mg/kg (n = 15) groups. The left coronary artery was ligated for 5  min and then released with ECG and blood pressure monitoring. Cariporide was  intravenously given as a bolus 2 min before the reperfusion. The heart was  rapidly excised and frozen 3 min after the onset of ventricular fibrillation,  otherwise 10 min after the reperfusion. The adenosine triphosphate (ATP),  creatine phosphate (CP), and glycogen contents were measured in the reperfused  ischemic myocardium by using an enzymatic fluorometric assay technique. The  incidence of the lethal ventricular fibrillation was 53% in the vehicle, 27% in  the low-dose and 7% in the high-dose group. The concentrations (mean+/-SEM) of  ATP, CP (nmol/mg protein), and glycogen (nmol as glucose/mg protein) were 74+/-4,  255+/-19, and 164+/-21 in the sham, 23+/-4, 763+/-70, and 61+/-7 in the vehicle,  27+/-4, 180+/-16, and 104+/-14 in the low-dose, and 32+/-4, 178+/-24, and 108+/-8  in the high-dose groups, respectively, indicating that cariporide significantly  blunted CP overshoot as well as glycogenolysis during reperfusion. Thus  cariporide can be expected to depress arrhythmogenesis and protect the metabolic  status of the heart.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE--Cerebral arteriolar dilation to N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) is a neuronally mediated process that is sensitive to cerebral ischemia.  We tested the hypothesis that pretreatment with transcription or translation  inhibitors preserves the vascular response to NMDA after global cerebral  ischemia. METHODS--Pial arteriolar diameters were measured in anesthetized  piglets by use of a closed cranial window and intravital microscopy. Arteriolar  responses to NMDA (10(-5) and 10(-4) mol/L) were measured before and 1, 2, and 4  hours after 10 minutes of ischemia. Ischemia was induced by increasing  intracranial pressure. Subgroups were pretreated with vehicle, topical  actinomycin D (Act-D) 10(-5) or 10(-6) mol/L, or intravenous cycloheximide (CHX)  1.0 or 0.3 mg/kg 15 minutes before ischemia. The effects of Act-D and CHX on  vascular responses to NMDA without preceding ischemia were also examined.  RESULTS--In the vehicle group, arteriolar responses to NMDA were clearly  attenuated 1 hour after ischemia but returned to baseline at 2 to 4 hours.  Preischemic compared with 1 hour postischemic arteriolar dilation to NMDA was  10+/-2% versus 1+/-0% at 10(-5) mol/L and 40+/-4% versus 20+/-4% at 10(-4) mol/L  NMDA (mean+/-SEM; both P<0.05, n=7). In contrast, pretreatment with Act-D  resulted in preservation of the arteriolar responses to NMDA 1 hour after  ischemia. For 10(-6) mol/L (n=5) of Act-D, dilations were 6+/-2% versus 6+/-2% at  10(-5) mol/L and 51+/-9% versus 39+/-10% at 10(-4) mol/L of NMDA. For 10(-5)  mol/L (n=5) of Act-D, arterioles dilated by 7+/-2% versus 7+/-2% at 10(-5) mol/L  and 38+/-4% versus 35+/-4% at 10(-4) mol/L NMDA. Similarly, CHX preserved  NMDA-induced vasodilation. For 0.3 mg/kg of CHX (n=5), dilations were 8+/-2%  versus 8+/-1% at 10(-5) mol/L and 39+/-4% versus 28+/-6% at 10(-4) mol/L NMDA.  For 1.0 mg/kg of CHX (n=5), arterioles dilated by 10+/-2% versus 6+/-2% at 10(-5)  mol/L and 37+/-7% versus 35+/-6% at 10(-4) mol/L NMDA. In experiments without  ischemia, NMDA-induced vasodilation before and 85 minutes after administration of  Act-D or CHX was not significantly different. CONCLUSIONS--Vascular responses of  cerebral arterioles to NMDA after ischemia are preserved by pretreatment with  either Act-D or CHX. Without preceding ischemia, Act-D and CHX do not potentiate  neuronal-vascular responses to NMDA. Our results suggest that continued or  augmented protein synthesis is involved in the transient attenuation of  NMDA-induced dilation during the early reperfusion phase and that inhibitors of  protein synthesis may protect neurons against ischemic stress.

AB  - The possible cardioprotective effects of preconditioning by ischaemia (IPC) or a low dose of H2O2 (HPC) prior to a high dose of H2O2 was investigated.  Langendorff-perfused rat hearts (n = 10 in each group) were subjected to 10 min  of 140 micromol/L H2O2 and 30 min recovery after either (1) control perfusion,  (2) 20 micromol/L H2O2 for 10 min, recovery 10 min, or (3) 2 x 2 min global  ischaemia and 5 min reperfusion. 140 micromol/L H2O2 increased left ventricular  end-diastolic pressure from 0 to 68+/-8 mmHg in controls (mean+/-SEM), which was  attenuated by IPC (46+/-9 mmHg, p<0.001) and HPC (18+/-4 mmHg, p < 0.001 compared  to controls, p < 0.01 compared to IPC). HPC, but not IPC, improved coronary flow  (p < 0.02) and left ventricular developed pressure (p < 0.001) during recovery.  Troponin T release was similar in all groups. Tissue thiobarbituric acid reactive  substances, antioxidant capacity, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase were not  influenced by 140 micromol/L H2O2. H2O2 decreased the level of tissue  glutathione. This reduction was augmented by HPC (p <0.02) and attenuated by IPC  (p < 0.02). H2O2 increased superoxide dismutase (p < 0.04). The increase was  attenuated by IPC (p < 0.05), but not influenced by HPC. HPC efficiently  protected cardiac function in H2O2-induced cardiac injury, while IPC had only a  small protective effect. The functional protection cannot be explained by  reduction of irreversible injury, attenuation of lipid peroxidation, or  modification of tissue antioxidant parameters.

AB  - Neutrophils are known to mediate injury in acute ischemic stroke especially during reperfusion. Migration of neutrophils into regions of ischemic injury  involves binding to the endothelial cell's intercellular adhesion molecule  (ICAM-1) through the leukocyte integrin, CD11/CD18. We studied the potential for  neuroprotection with a humanized antibody that binds to and blocks the functions  of the CD11/CD18 integrin in a rabbit model of transient focal ischemia. Fifteen  New Zealand White rabbits underwent transorbital occlusion of the left middle  cerebral, anterior cerebral, and internal carotid arteries using aneurysm clips  for 2 h, followed by 6 h of reperfusion. Treatment with a maximally saturating  dose (4 mg/kg) of a humanized CD11/CD18 monoclonal antibody (Hu23F2G, ICOS Corp.,  Bothell, WA) (n = 8) or placebo (n = 7) was administered 20 min after occlusion  and given as a single intravenous bolus. Hemispheric ischemic neuronal damage  (IND) as seen on hematoxylin- and eosin-stained sections was significantly  reduced in Hu23F2G-treated animals by 57% (Hu23F2G: 15 +/- 6.9%; placebo: 35 +/-  5%; mean +/- SEM, P < 0.05, t-test). Immunohistochemical staining with neutrophil  elastase confirmed the presence of neutrophils within regions of IND in control  brains. Treatment with Hu23F2G resulted in marked reduction of neutrophil  infiltration. (No. of neutrophils/IND area: Hu23F2G 36.1 +/- 36.7 cm-2, placebo  460.6 +/- 101.8 cm-2, P = 0.001. ) Antagonism of neutrophil migration at the  level of the CD11/CD18 integrin reduces ischemic injury in experimental stroke.

TI  - Measurement of overinflation by multiple linear regression analysis in patients with acute lung injury.
AU  - Bersten, A. D.
T2  - The European respiratory journal
AB  - Strategies to optimize alveolar recruitment and prevent lung overinflation are central to ventilatory management of patients with acute lung injury (ALI). The  recent description of overinflation using multilinear regression analysis of  airway pressure (Paw) and flow (V') data allows a functional assessment of lung  mechanics. However, this technique has not been studied in ALI patients. During  15 positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) trials in 10 ALI patients, respiratory  elastance was partitioned into volume-independent (E1) and volume-dependent  (E2VT) components, where Paw=(E1+E2VT)V+RrsV'+Po; where V is volume, VT is tidal  volume, Rrs is respiratory resistance and Po is static recoil pressure at  end-expiration (equivalent to total PEEP). Then, %E2 was calculated as  (100E2VT)/(E1+E2VT); a measure of lung overinflation when %E2>30%. Alveolar  recruitment, assessed as a PEEP-induced increase in V>50 mL at a constant Paw  occurred in 14 of 15 trials (299+/-34 mL, mean+/-SEM), but was independent of the  degree of lung inflation. Lung overinflation was common (six of 15 clinically set  PEEP levels) and occurred despite a dynamic elastic distending pressure (Pel,dyn)  <30 cmH2O during 18 of 36 PEEP titrations. During a PEEP titration the resultant  %E2 was directly related to delta(peak airway pressure-Po) (rs=0.86, p<0.001) and  delta(Pel,dyn-Po) (rs=0.89, p<0.001). The 95% predictive intervals for a 2 cmH2O  change in either driving pressure were %E2 values of 30.4-68.1% and 32.8-69.2%,  respectively. Single or continuous measurement of %E2 (a measure of lung  inflation) is a readily available method for titrating ventilatory parameters.  Further, during a positive end-expiratory pressure titration a change in  ventilatory driving pressure > or =2 cmH2O is indicative of overinflation.

T2  - Japanese circulation journal
AB  - To elucidate whether or not Ca channel blockers have an intrinsic benefit that cannot be attributed to the reduction of Ca2+ entry by pretreatment,  time-averaged intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and energy-related  phosphates were measured in isolated ferret hearts using nuclear magnetic  resonance. In the drug-free ischemic group, [Ca2+]i increased significantly  during 30 min of global ischemia at 30 degrees C and during 0-5 min of  reperfusion. After 30 min of reperfusion, isovolumic left ventricular developed  pressure recovered only to 63+/-7% of the pre-ischemic level (mean+/-SEM; N=5).  Pretreatment with the Ca channel blocker clentiazem (10(-7) mol/L) itself  depressed developed pressure by 53+/-9%. In the clentiazem group, [Ca2+]i showed  no significant changes during ischemia or reperfusion. Recovery of developed  pressure (87+/-8% of untreated level) was significantly higher than in the  non-treated group (p<0.05). Nevertheless, when the negative inotropism of  clentiazem was offset by increasing [Ca]o from 2 to 3 mmol/L, no beneficial  effects of clentiazem were observed; [Ca2+]i increased significantly during 0-5  min of reperfusion, and developed pressure recovered only 60+/-7% of untreated  level. These results indicate that reduction of Ca2+ entry from the extracellular  space to the myocyte, as reflected by negative inotropism during pretreatment, is  required for clentiazem to protect myocardium in a model of global ischemia and  reperfusion.

T2  - Circulation
AB  - BACKGROUND: A threshold concept for ischemic preconditioning (IPc) has been proposed. It is unclear, however, whether IPc, above a certain threshold, is an  all-or-nothing or a graded phenomenon. METHODS AND RESULTS: In 71  enflurane-anesthetized swine, severe left anterior descending coronary artery  hypoperfusion for 90 minutes followed by 2 hours of reperfusion resulted in an  infarct size (IS, by triphenyltetrazolium chloride) of 16.7+/-3.4% (SEM) of the  area at risk. IPc by 2 minutes of low-flow ischemia and 15 minutes of reperfusion  before the 90-minute target ischemia did not reduce IS (21.9+/-7.0%). IS was  decreased to 9.0+/-2.6% (P<0.05) by 3 minutes of IPc and reduced further to  1.9+/-0.9% (P<0.05) by 10 minutes of IPc. The interstitial adenosine  concentration (microdialysis, high-performance liquid chromatography) was  unchanged with 2 and 3 minutes of IPc but increased with 10 minutes of IPc (by  573+/-144%). The interstitial bradykinin concentration (microdialysis,  radioimmunoassay) remained unchanged with 2 minutes of IPc but increased to a  similar extent with 3 minutes (by 198+/-32%) and 10 minutes (by 224+/-30%) of  IPc. The IS reduction by 3 minutes of IPc was abolished by blockade of the  bradykinin B2 receptor with intracoronary HOE 140 (16.6+/-4.3%) but not with  intracoronary infusion of adenosine deaminase (8.4+/-2.5%, P<0.05). HOE 140,  however, did not affect the IS reduction (3.5+/- 1.1%, P<0.05) by 10 minutes of  IPc. Combined infusion of HOE 140 and adenosine deaminase abolished the IS  reduction by 10 minutes of IPc (15.4+/-6.7%). CONCLUSIONS: IS reduction by IPc is  a graded phenomenon. Whereas bradykinin is essential during preconditioning  ischemia of shorter duration, adenosine is more important during preconditioning  ischemia of longer duration.

SETTING: Laboratory at a university medical  center. SUBJECTS: Nineteen certified healthy pigs, weighing 15 to 20 kg.  INTERVENTIONS: Pigs were anesthetized and surgically prepared for hemodynamic and  lung function measurements. Animals were randomized into four groups: a) Control  pigs (n = 4) received an intravenous infusion of saline without Escherichia  colilipopolysaccharide (LPS); b) the LPS group (n = 5) received an intravenous  infusion of saline containing LPS (100 microg/kg); c) the PEEP plus saline group  (n = 5) received an intravenous infusion of saline containing LPS. Two hours  after LPS infusion, saline was instilled into the lung as a control for  surfactant instillation, and the animals were placed on 7.5 cm H2O of PEEP; d)  the PEEP plus surfactant group (n = 5) received an intravenous infusion of saline  containing LPS. Two hours following LPS infusion, surfactant (50 mg/kg) was  instilled into the lung and the animals were placed on 7.5 cm H2O of PEEP. PEEP  was applied first and surfactant or saline was instilled into the lung while  maintaining positive pressure ventilation. All groups were studied for 6 hrs  after the start of LPS injection. At necropsy, bronchoalveolar lavage was  performed and the right middle lung lobe was fixed for histologic analysis.  MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Compared with LPS without treatment, PEEP plus  surfactant significantly increased PaO2 (PEEP plus surfactant = 156.6 +/- 18.6  [SEM] torr [20.8 +/- 2.5 kPa]; LPS = 79.2 +/- 21.9 torr [10.5 +/- 2.9 kPa];  p<.05), and decreased venous admixture (PEEP plus surfactant = 12.5 +/- 2.0%; LPS  = 46.9 +/- 14.2%; p< .05) 5 hrs after LPS infusion. These changes were not  significant 6 hrs after LPS infusion. PEEP plus surfactant did not alter  ventilatory efficiency index (VEI = 3800/[peak airway pressure - PEEP] x  respiratory rate x PacO2), or static compliance as compared with LPS without  treatment at any time point. Cytologic analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid  showed that surfactant treatment significantly increased the percentage of  alveolar neutrophils as compared with LPS without treatment (PEEP plus surfactant  = 39.1 +/- 5.5%; LPS = 17.4 +/- 6.6%; p< .05). Histologic analysis showed that  LPS caused edema accumulation around the airways and pulmonary vessels, and a  significant increase in the number of sequestered leukocytes (LPS group = 3.4 +/-  0.2 cells/6400 micro2; control group = 1.3 +/- 0.1 cells/6400 micro2; p < .05).  PEEP plus saline and PEEP plus surfactant significantly increased the total  number of sequestered leukocytes in the pulmonary parenchyma (PEEP plus  surfactant = 8.2 +/- 0.7 cells/6400 micro2; PEEP plus saline = 3.9 +/- 0.2  cells/6400 micro2; p <.05) compared with the control and LPS groups. CONCLUSIONS:  We conclude that PEEP plus surfactant treatment of endotoxin-induced lung injury  transiently improves oxygenation, but is unable to maintain this salutary effect  indefinitely. Thus, repeat bolus dosing of surfactant or bolus treatment followed  by continuous aerosol delivery may be necessary for a continuous beneficial  effect.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the contribution of soft-tissue trauma plus hemorrhage, bone fracture and hemorrhage, as well as the contribution of bone fracture,  soft-tissue trauma and hemorrhage on host immune function. SUBJECTS: Adult male  mice (n = 6/group). DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, controlled study. SETTING:  Animal laboratory at a university-affiliated hospital. INTERVENTIONS: Closed-bone  fracture (right lower leg; external fixation) and/or soft-tissue trauma (2.5-cm  midline laparotomy, closed in two layers) were induced before hemorrhagic shock  (mean arterial blood pressure of 35 +/- 5 (SEM) mm Hg for 90 mins, followed by  fluid resuscitation) in male C3H/HeN mice and the animals were killed at 72 hrs  after initiation of the experiment. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Splenocyte  interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-3 release capacity, as well as splenic and peritoneal  macrophage IL-1 and IL-6 release capacity were determined. Different traumatic  insults, i.e., bone fracture or soft-tissue trauma in conjunction with  hemorrhage, produced comparable immune depression. More significant depression of  splenocyte IL-2 and IL-3 release capacity as well as macrophage IL-1 and IL-6  release capacity occurred with the combined insult (i.e., bone  fracture/soft-tissue injury and hemorrhage) than after bone injury or tissue  trauma alone with hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of closed-bone  fracture and soft-tissue trauma before hemorrhage leads to even more compromised  immunity than either soft-tissue trauma or closed-bone fracture along with  hemorrhage. The markedly depressed immune function following bone injury,  soft-tissue trauma, and hemorrhagic shock may contribute to the increased  susceptibility of severely injured patients to sepsis and the ensuing multiple  organ failure in the clinical situation.

AB  - Glomerular function and structure were serially evaluated in 15 patients with membranous nephropathy who exhibited relapsing nephrosis and chronic depression  of GFR. GFR declined from 56+/-8 (mean+/-SEM) at onset to 31+/-4 ml/min per 1.73  m2 after a 2- to 5-yr period of observation (P < 0.05). An analysis of filtration  dynamics suggested persistent elevation of net ultrafiltration pressure. To  examine a possible role for declining intrinsic glomerular filtration capacity as  the basis for the observed hypofiltration, glomeruli in the baseline and a repeat  biopsy (performed after a median of 28 mo) were subjected to morphometric  analysis and mathematical modeling. Analysis of the baseline biopsy revealed a  reduction in filtration slit frequency and thickening of the glomerular basement  membrane, lowering computed hydraulic permeability by 66% compared with normal  kidney donors. In contrast, filtration surface area was increased by 37% as a  result of glomerular hypertrophy. The repeat biopsy revealed persistent  depression of hydraulic permeability, primarily owing to foot process broadening.  An additional finding was a decrease in filtration surface area from baseline in  patent glomeruli, possibly due to encroachment on the capillary lumen of an  increasingly widened basement membrane. Also, a striking increase in the  prevalence of global glomerulosclerosis from 7+/-2% to 23+/-4% was found between  the two biopsies, suggesting a significant loss of functioning nephrons. It is  concluded that hypofiltration in membranous nephropathy is the consequence of a  biphasic loss of glomerular ultrafiltration capacity, initially owing to impaired  hydraulic permeability that is later exacerbated by a superimposed loss of  functioning glomeruli and of filtration surface area.

AU  - Weiswasser, J.

T2  - Journal of pediatric surgery
AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: If the goal of partial liquid ventilation (PLV) with perfluorocarbons in the management of respiratory failure is to improve dynamic  lung compliance (Cdyn) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) while sustaining  O2 delivery, the optimal ventilatory management is unclear. The authors asked if  volume-cycled or pressure-limited ventilation had different effects on PVR,  cardiac index (CI), and Cdyn in uninjured and injured neonatal piglet lungs.  METHODS: Anesthetized piglets (6 to 8 kg) were ventilated after tracheostomy.  Cdyn was measured by in-line Fleisch pneumotach/PC data acquisition terminal.  Thermodilution instrumentation allowed determination of both CI and PVR.  Volume-control or pressure-limited ventilation was established in uninjured or  injured (surfactant deficiency induced by saline lavage at 18 mL/kg) animals.  After a stable 30-minute baseline, animals were assigned randomly to one of four  groups: group I (n = 9), uninjured animals plus volume-cycled ventilation  (intermittent mandatory ventilation [IMV], 10 bpm; tidal volume [TV], 15 mL/kg,  positive end-expiratory pressure [PEEP], 5 cm H2O; FIO2, 1.0; and PLV for 150  minutes); group II (n = 9), uninjured animals plus pressure-limited ventilation  (IMV, 10 bpm; peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), 25 cm H2O, PEEP, 5 cm H2O, FIO2,  1.0; and PLV for 150 minutes); group III (n = 7), injured animals plus  volume-cycled ventilation (IMV, 10 bpm; TV, 15 mL/kg; PEEP, 5 cm H2O; FIO2, 1.0  for 30 minutes, followed by saline injury for group IV (n = 7), injured animals  plus pressure-limited ventilation (IMV, 10 bpm; PIP, 25 cm H2O; PEEP, 5 cm H2O;  FIO2, 1.0 for 30 minutes, followed by saline injury, and PLV rescue). Comparison  within and between groups was accomplished by repeated measures analysis of  variance (ANOVA) with Tukey correction. RESULTS: There was no significant  difference between volume-cycled or pressure-limited ventilation in healthy  lungs; however, in the setting of lung injury, dynamic compliance was 1.44 +/-  0.15 after 180 minutes in the volume-cycled group and 0.91 +/- 0.10 in the  pressure-limited group after the same interval (mL/cm H2O x kg +/- SEM).  Similarly, PVR was 100 +/- 6 in the volume-cycled group and 145 +/- 12 in the  pressure-limited group after 180 minutes of lung injury (mm Hg/L/kg x min +/-  SEM). Cardiac index declined significantly in all groups independent of  ventilatory mode. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that in the setting of lung  injury, Cdyn and PVR improved significantly when volume-cycled, compared with  pressure-limited ventilation was used. Although no difference existed between  ventilatory modes in healthy lungs, pressure-limited ventilation, when combined  with PLV in injured lungs, had adverse effects on lung compliance and pulmonary  vascular resistance. Volume-cycled ventilation may optimize the ability of  perfluorocarbon to recruit collapsed or atelectatic lung regions.

AB  - Diaspirin cross-linked haemoglobin (DCLHb) is a new oxygen carrying blood substitute with vasoactive properties. Vasoactive properties may be mediated via  high affinity binding of nitric oxide by the haem moiety. Using a rodent model of  head injury combined with ischaemia, we studied the effects of DCLHb on cerebral  blood flow (CBF) and intracranial pressure (ICP). Twenty anaesthetized rats were  allocated randomly to receive treatment with DCLHb 400 mg kg-1 i.v. or placebo  (oncotically matched plasma protein substitute 4.5% i.v.). To produce diffusely  increased ICP, after a severe weight drop injury, all animals underwent a 30-min  period of bilateral carotid ligation combined with a period of induced  hypotension. After reperfusion, DCLHb or placebo was infused and the animals  instrumented for measurement of intraventricular ICP and CBF in the region of the  sensorimotor cortex using the hydrogen clearance technique. Mean arterial  pressure (MAP), ICP, cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) (CPP = MAP - ICP) and CBF  were measured 4 h after injury in all animals. DCLHb significantly reduced ICP  from mean 13 (SEM 2) to 3 (1) mm Hg (P < 0.001), increased CPP from 52 (8) to 95  (6) mm Hg (P < 0.001) and increased CBF from 21 (2) to 29 (2) ml 100 g-1 min-1 (P  = 0.032). We conclude that DCLHb improved CPP without a reduction in CBF in a  rodent model of post-traumatic brain swelling.

T2  - The Journal of heart and lung transplantation : the official publication of the International Society for Heart Transplantation
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies of myocardial edema and diastolic dysfunction in rat heart transplantation have been flawed by ischemic injury. This study uses improved  methods to prevent ischemic contracture. METHODS: Hearts of 30 ACI rats were  transplanted into the abdomen of Lewis rats by use of cold University of  Wisconsin solution for improved preservation. Left ventricular diastolic  properties were expressed as volume at standardized pressure intervals. RESULTS:  On posttransplantation day 3, mean left ventricular volume at 15 mm Hg in  allografts (290 +/- 9 microl, SEM) was not significantly different vs isografts  (299 +/- 32 microl), allografts on day 0 (337 +/- 28 ml) or day 1 (324 +/- 20  microl), or native hearts (334 +/- 19 microl). However, volume was reduced to 173  +/- 17 microl on day 4 and to 70 +/- 23 microl on day 5 (p < 0.05). Similar  findings were obtained for volume at 5 and 10 mm Hg. Allograft myocardial water  content on day 3, 76.3% +/- 5%, similar to allografts on day 0 and 1 and to  isografts on day 3, increased to 77.6% +/- 8% on day 4 (NS) and 79.4% +/- 6% on  day 5 (p < 0.05 vs day 0). Histologically, rejection in allografts was mild on  day 3, moderate on day 4, and severe on day 5. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced left  ventricular filling volume during rejection is only partially explained by edema.  Abnormalities of diastolic properties previously attributed to the unloaded state  of nonworking heart models may actually reflect inadequate peritransplantation  myocardial protection.

AU  - Farkas, A.

T2  - European journal of pharmacology
AB  - In this study the antiarrhythmic and the proarrhythmic activities of almokalant, a selective class III antiarrhythmic agent, were compared. The antiarrhythmic  effect of the drug was tested in pentobarbital-anaesthetised rabbits. Arrhythmia  was evoked by occluding and releasing the left circumflex coronary artery.  Almokalant in a dose of 250 nmol/kg i.v., significantly decreased the incidence  of reperfusion induced ventricular fibrillation (21% vs. 75% in the control  group) and increased the proportion of surviving animals during reperfusion (86%  vs. 42%). The proarrhythmic effect of almokalant was examined during  alpha1-adrenoceptor stimulation in chloralose-anaesthetised rabbits. Almokalant  (75 nmol/kg per min) triggered torsade de pointes arrhythmias in 8 animals out of  11. The dose of almokalant (mean+/-S.E.M.) required to produce this effect was  1181+/-519 nmol/kg. It is concluded that, although almokalant is an effective  antiarrhythmic agent against ischaemia-reperfusion induced arrhythmias, it has  marked proarrhythmic activity during alpha1-adrenoceptor stimulation.

AB  - We investigated the effect of H290/51, a novel, low-molecular-weight inhibitor of lipid peroxidation, on cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury. Lactate dehydrogenase  (LD) release from cultured cardiomyocytes exposed to 1 h hypoxia and 4 h  reoxygenation was measured after pretreatment with different concentrations of  H290/51. In another series, Langendorff-perfused rat hearts were exposed to 30  min global ischemia and 60 min reperfusion (n=minimum 10 in each group): 1.  Control ischemia-reperfusion. 2. Vehicle throughout the experiment. 3. Vehicle  during stabilization, and H290/51 (10(-6) mol/l) during reperfusion. 4. H290/51  throughout the experiments. During reoxygenation of isolated cardiomyocytes,  H290/51 dose dependently inhibited LD release with an pIC50 value of 7.2+/-0.4  (mean+/-SEM), with 10(-6) mol/l as the lowest efficient concentration. In  isolated hearts ischemia-reperfusion induced severe reperfusion arrhythmias,  reduced left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) and coronary flow (CF), and  increased LV end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). LD activity in the effluent  increased. H290/51 throughout perfusion (group 4) reduced the occurrence of  severe reperfusion arrhythmias (p < .0001), attenuated the decrease of LVDP (p <  .008), and CF (p < .006), the increase of LVEDP (p < .008), and the release of LD  (p < .002). Tissue contents of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances did not  increase during reperfusion in controls, but was reduced in group 4 (p < .004).  H290/51 given only during reperfusion (group 3) tended to improve cardiac  function, but significantly so only for increase of CF (p < .01). The lipid  peroxidation inhibitor H290/51 attenuated cardiac injury induced by  ischemia-reperfusion.

T2  - Ostomy/wound management
AB  - Laser-Doppler blood perfusion was simultaneously measured on both great toes and the lateral upper-calf before and during fore-foot-to-knee compression bandaging  of one test-leg in ten vascularly healthy female volunteers. Two bandaging  methods were sequentially used separated by a 30 minutes interval. Bandage A  consisted of a layer of zinc impregnated gauze and an elastic wrap; bandage B had  the elastic wrap only. Sub-bandage pressures of the test-leg were measured at  distal and proximal lateral below-knee standardized sites. The study purpose was  to determine the effects of moderate compression pressure achieved for bandages A  under and distal to bandaged regions. Initial (mean +/- sem_ sub-bandage pressure  achieved for bandages A and B were similar, being respectively 32.9 +/- 2.8 and  28.4 +/- 3.9 mm Hg. Both bandages types were associated with significant  reductions in test-leg toe blood perfusion amounting to 44.2 +/- 13.1 percent and  27.5 +/- 10.5 percent for bandages A and B respectively. Contrastingly, test-leg  sub-bandage blood perfusion did not differ from its pre-bandage baseline mean  level for either bandage type. These findings show that a widely used bandaging  method and a slight variant each significantly reduces distal (toe) blood  perfusion without reducing sub-bandage skin perfusion. Absence of sub-bandage  perfusion decreases may be related to a partially compensating reflex  vasodilatory response, but such effects if present are inadequate to prevent  reductions in distal perfusion. These results reinforce the need for due care and  risk-benefit consideration with respect to therapeutic compression levels.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the usefulness of functional magnetic stimulation (FMS) as a noninvasive method for assisting cough in patients with tetraplegia. DESIGN: A  prospective before-after trial. SETTING: The functional magnetic stimulation  laboratory of a spinal cord injury (SCI) service. PARTICIPANTS: Thirteen male SCI  patients, with injury levels between C4 and C7. INTERVENTION: A commercially  available magnetic stimulator with a round magnetic coil (MC) was used.  Expiratory muscle activation was achieved by placing the MC along the lower  thoracic spine. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The planned major outcome measures were the  maximal expired pressure (MEP), expiratory reserve volume (ERV), and forced  expiratory flow rate (FEF) by FMS compared with voluntary maximal efforts.  Another outcome was the optimal MC placement and stimulation intensity that would  result in highest expired pressure. RESULTS: The mean (+/-SEM) MEP, ERV, and FEF  generated by FMS were 66.40 +/- 6.69 cmH2O, .77 +/- .14 L, and 5.28 +/- .42  L/sec, respectively. They were 118%, 169%, and 110% of voluntary maximum efforts.  MC placement at the T10 to T11 spinous process and stimulation intensity at 80%  produced the highest MEP and FEF. CONCLUSION: FMS of the expiratory muscles  produced significant expired pressures, volumes, and flow rates when compared  with voluntary maximum efforts; therefore, FMS can be used as an effective method  to restore cough in tetraplegic patients.

AB  - We investigated the predictors of the rate of glomerular filtration rate decline (delta GFR) and progression to end-stage renal failure (ESRF) in the 352 patients  with proteinuric non-diabetic chronic nephropathies [urinary protein excretion  rate (UProt) > or = 1 g/24 hr, creatinine clearance 20 to 70 ml/min/1.73 m2]  enrolled in the Ramipril Efficacy In Nephropathy (REIN) study. Overall the GFR  declined linearly by 0.46 +/- 0.05 ml/min/1.73 m2/month (mean rate +/- SEM) over  a median follow-up of 23 months (range 3 to 64 months), and progression to ESRF  was 17.3%. Using multivariate analysis, higher UProt and mean arterial pressure  (MAP) independently correlated with a faster delta GFR (P = 0.0001 and P =  0.0002, respectively) and progression to ESRF (P = 0.0001 and P = 0.003,  respectively). Mean UProt and systolic blood pressure during follow-up were the  only time-dependent covariates that significantly correlated with delta GFR (P =  0.005 and P = 0.003, respectively) and ESRF (P = 0.006 and P = 0.0001,  respectively). After stratification for baseline UProt, patients in the lowest  tertile (UProt < 1.9 g/24 hr) had the slowest delta GFR (0.16 +/- 0.07  ml/min/1.73 m2/month) and progression to ESRF (4.3%) as compared with patients in  the middle tertile (UProt 2.0 to 3.8 g/24hr; delta GFR, 0.55 +/- 0.09 ml/min/1.73  m2/month, P = 0.0002; ESRF, 15.3%, P = 0.0001) and in the highest tertile (UProt  3.9 to 18.8 g/24 hr; delta GFR, 0.70 +/- 0.11 ml/min/1.73 m2/month, P = 0.0001;  ESRF, 32.5%, P = 0.0001). Both delta GFR (P = 0.01) and progression to ESRF (P =  0.01) significantly differed even between the middle and the highest tertiles. On  the contrary, stratification in tertiles of baseline MAP failed to segregate  subgroups of patients into different risk levels. Patients with the highest  proteinuria and blood pressure were those with the fastest progression (delta  GFR, 0.91 +/- 0.23; ESRF 34.7%). Of interest, at each level of baseline MAP, a  higher proteinuria was associated with a faster delta GFR and progression to  ESRF. On the other hand, at each level of proteinuria, a faster delta GFR was  associated with MAP only in the highest tertile (> 112 mm Hg) and the risk of  ESRF was independent of the MAP. Thus, in chronic nephropathies proteinuria is  the best independent predictor of both disease progression and ESRF. Arterial  hypertension may contribute to the acceleration of renal injury associated with  enhanced traffic of plasma proteins. Antihypertensive drugs that most effectively  limit protein traffic at comparable levels of blood pressure are those that most  effectively slow disease progression and delay or prevent ESRF in proteinuric  chronic nephropathies.

T2  - Journal of the American College of Cardiology
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study sought to investigate the myocardial mechanisms causing refractoriness to ischemic preconditioning in pigs. BACKGROUND: Ischemic  preconditioning in the pig vanishes after 60 min and cannot be reinstated by a  second cycle of brief coronary occlusions at this time point. Ischemic  preconditioning has been shown to be mediated by adenosine A1-receptors. Because  myocardial adenosine production during ischemia ceases as the number of repeated  brief ischemic episodes increases, we hypothesized that this lack of adenosine  may cause this myocardial refractoriness. METHODS: In open chest pigs, ischemic  preconditioning was achieved by repeated brief coronary occlusions. Myocardial  adenosine content was assessed by high performance liquid chromatographic  analysis of serial myocardial biopsy samples; infarct size (percent infarcted  area of the area at risk) was determined using tetrazolium salts. RESULTS:  Ischemic preconditioning by two cycles of occlusion of the left anterior  descending coronary artery (10 min) and reperfusion (30 min) decreased infarct  size ([mean +/- SEM] 40.4+/-2.9%; control: 76.9+/-1.8%, p < 0.001). Prolonging  the second reperfusion period to 60 min caused ischemic preconditioning to vanish  (79.0+/-0.5%) and caused refractoriness to a second cycle of preconditioning  (70.0+/-2.0%). Myocardial adenosine content increased only during the first  coronary occlusion (baseline: 110.9+/-42.0 nmol/g dry weight; first coronary  occlusion: 1,686.2+/-244.1, p < 0.001) but not during subsequent coronary  occlusions. In refractory myocardium, intramyocardial microinfusion of the  adenosine A1-receptor agonist N6-cyclohexyladenosine (CHA [0.3 mmol/liter]) again  decreased infarct size (27.4+/-7.0%, p < 0.001 vs. control). CONCLUSIONS:  Myocardial refractoriness may be caused by the inability to produce adenosine  endogenously. In refractory myocardium, application of CHA reinduces  cardioprotection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Biliary fistulae may occur following surgical injury, abdominal trauma, or inadequate closure of a cystic duct stump. These leaks are most often  managed by drainage of the associate biloma and either endoscopic sphincterotomy  or placement of a biliary endoprosthesis to decrease the pressure gradient  between the bile duct and the duodenum created by the muscular contraction of the  ampullary sphincter. In a previous study, we demonstrated a statistically  significant reduction in ductal pressures following stent placement as compared  to sphincterotomy. The goal of this present study was to determine if reduction  in ductal pressures correlates clinically with the resolution of biliary leaks in  an animal model. METHODS: Fourteen mongrel dogs underwent laparotomy,  cholecystectomy without closure of the cystic stump, and a lateral duodenotomy to  identify the major papilla. The dogs were then randomized into three groups.  Group I (n = 5) was a control group undergoing closure of the duodenotomy only.  Group II (n = 4) underwent sphincterotomy. Group III (n = 5) underwent placement  of a 7 Fr x 5 cm biliary endoprosthesis prior to duodenotomy closure. A drain was  placed adjacent to the cystic duct stump in all groups. Drain output was recorded  daily. The biliary leak was considered resolved when the output was < 10 cc/day.  Regardless of suspected fistula closure, the drains were not removed until 2  weeks postprocedure. Necropsy was performed to identify undrained intraperitoneal  bile. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's paired t test. RESULTS:  All dogs had bile leaks identified on postoperative day 1. The number of days  required for resolution of bile leak in group I (mean +/- SEM) was 7.60 +/- 0.87  days, as compared to 6.75 +/- 0.80 days for group II and 2.60 +/- 0.24 days for  group III. There was no significant difference in the duration of bile leak  between groups I and II (p = 0.445). Group III, however, had a significant  reduction in the duration of biliary fistulae as compared to both groups I and II  (p < 0.005). At autopsy, persistent bilomas were identified in 80% of group I,  25% of group II, and 0% of group III. None of the dogs showed evidence of  dehisence of the duodenotomy closure site as a source of bile leak. CONCLUSION:  Biliary stenting significantly reduces the time to resolution of cystic duct  leaks as compared to sphincterotomy in a canine model. The results obtained in  this study support the use of biliary endoprostheses in the management of biliary  leaks and fistulae.

AB  - Acute lung injury is characterized by hypoxemia due to pulmonary ventilation/perfusion-mismatching. I.v. administered prostaglandin E1 (PGE1), a  vasodilator with a high pulmonary clearance, has been studied in acute lung  injury. Inhalation of the vasodilators nitric oxide and prostacyclin improved  oxygenation by selective dilation of the pulmonary vasculature in ventilated lung  areas. In the present study, PGE1 inhalation was used for treatment of acute lung  injury. Fifteen patients with acute lung injury defined as PaO2/fraction of  inspired oxygen (FIO2) <160 mm Hg were treated with PGE1 inhalation in addition  to standard intensive care. The drug was continuously delivered via a pneumatic  nebulizer. Acute physiology and chronic health evaluation system II and multiple  organ failure scores were (mean +/- SEM) 33 +/- 2 and 10 +/- 0.3, respectively.  Inhaled PGE1 was administered for 103 +/- 17 h at a dose of 41 +/- 2 microg/h.  The PaO2/FIO2 ratio increased from 105 +/- 9 to 160 +/- 17 mm Hg (P < 0.05) and  to 189 +/- 25 mm Hg (P < 0.05) after 4 h and 24 h, respectively. PGE1 inhalation  decreases in mean pulmonary artery pressure and central venous pressure were not  statistically significant. Mean arterial pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge  pressure, cardiac output, and heart rate remained unchanged. Intensive care unit  mortality was 40%. The present data suggest that inhaled PGE1 is an effective  therapeutic option for improving oxygenation in patients with acute lung injury.  Whether inhaled PGE1 will increase survival in acute lung injury should be  investigated in a controlled prospective trial. IMPLICATIONS: In patients with  severe acute lung injury and multiple organ failure, inhaled prostaglandin E1  improved oxygenation and decreased venous admixture without affecting systemic  hemodynamic variables. Controlled clinical trials are warranted.

TI  - Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) is not associated with elevated intracranial pressure (ICP).
AU  - Lee, T. T.
AU  - Galarza, M.
AU  - Villanueva, P. A.
T2  - Acta neurochirurgica
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Traditionally, intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring has been utilized in all patients with severe head injury (Glasgow coma score of 3-8).  Ventriculostomy placement, however, does carry a 4 to 10 percent complication  rate consisting mostly of hematoma and infection. The authors propose that a  subgroup of patients presenting with severe head trauma and diffuse axonal injury  without associated mass lesion, do not need ICP monitoring. Additionally, the  monitoring data from ICP, MAP, and CPP for a comparison severe head injury group,  and subgroups of DAI would be presented. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-six  patients sustaining blunt head trauma and fitting our strict clinical and  radiographic diagnosis of DAI were enrolled in our study. Inclusion criteria were  severe head injury patients who did not regain consciousness after the initial  impact, and whose CT scan demonstrated characteristic punctate hemorrhages of <  10 mm diameter at the greywhite junction, basal ganglia, corpus callosum, upper  brainstem, or a combination of the above. Patients with significant mass lesions  and documented anoxia were excluded. Their intracranial pressure (ICP) and  cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) were compared to a control group of 36  consecutive patients with severe non-penetrating non-operative head injury, using  the Analysis for Variance method. RESULTS: Eighteen (50.0%), six (16.7%), and  twelve (33.3%) patients had types I, II, and III DAI, respectively. The admission  Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) was higher for types I and II than for type III DAI. ICP  was monitored from 23 to 165 hours, with a mean ICP for 36 patients of 11.70 mmHg  (SEM = 0.75) and a range from 4.3 to 17.3 mmHg. Of all ICP recordings, of which  89.7%, (2421/2698) were < or = 20 mmHg. Average mean arterial pressure (MAP) was  96.08 mmHg (SEM = 1.69), and 94.6% (2038/2154) of all MAP readings were greater  than 80 mmHg. Average cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) was 85.16 mmHg (SEM =  1.68), and 90.1% (1941/2154) of all CPP readings were greater than 70 mmHg. This  is compared to the control group mean ICP, MAP, and CPP of 16.84 mmHg (p =  0.000021), 92.80 mmHg (p = 0.18), and 76.49 mmHg (p = 0.0012). No treatment for  sustained elevated ICP > 20 mmHg was needed for DAI patients except in two; one  with extensive intraventricular and subarachnoid hemorrhage who developed  communicating hydrocephalus, and another with ventriculitis requiring intrathecal  and intravenous antibiotic treatments. Two complications, one from a catheter  tract hematoma, and another with Staph epidermidis ventriculitis, were  encountered. All patients, except type III DAI, generally demonstrated marked  clinical improvement with time. The outcome, as measured by Glasgow Coma Score  (GCS) and Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS) was similarly better with types I and II  than type III DAI. CONCLUSION: The authors conclude that ICP elevation in DAI  patients without associated mass lesions is not as prevalent as other severe head  injured patients, therefore ICP monitoring may not be as critical. The presence  of an ICP monitoring device may contribute to increased morbidity. Of key  importance, however, is an accurate clinical history and interpretation of the CT  scan.

AB  - We examined electrophysiologic and morphologic changes following low pressure barotrauma in 25 guinea pigs. Compound action potentials (CAPs), cochlear  microphonics (CMs), and transiently evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) were  elicited by tone bursts (1, 2, 4 and 8 kHz) or non-linear clicks immediately  following barotrauma. CAP threshold elevations were observed in 19 out of 25  cochleas, mainly at lower stimulus frequencies. Furthermore, CM and TEOAE  thresholds were significantly increased, while CAP and CM amplitudes demonstrated  reductions at all stimulus frequencies and intensities. CAP N1 latencies  exhibited slight elongations at all stimulus frequencies and intensities. The  regression coefficient between the mean CAP thresholds of four stimulus  frequencies and TEOAE thresholds was statistically significant. Scanning electron  microscopy (SEM) study of six electrophysiologically abnormal cochleas revealed  stereocilia morphology in four, but no changes in two. We hypothesize that low  pressure barotrauma can injure inner ear hair cells through an early threshold  shift secondary to dislocation of the basement membrane.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of continuous hypertonic (3%) saline/acetate infusion on intracranial pressure (ICP) and lateral displacement of the brain in  patients with cerebral edema. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTINGS:  Neurocritical care unit of a university hospital. PATIENTS: Twenty-seven  consecutive patients with cerebral edema (30 episodes), including patients with  head trauma (n = 8), postoperative edema (n = 5), nontraumatic intracranial  hemorrhage (n = 8), and cerebral infarction (n = 6). INTERVENTION: Intravenous  infusion of 3% saline/acetate to increase serum sodium concentrations to 145 to  155 mmol/L. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A reduction in mean ICP within the  first 12 hrs correlating with an increase in the serum sodium concentration was  observed in patients with head trauma (r2 = .91, p = .03), and postoperative  edema (r2 = .82, p = .06), but not in patients with nontraumatic intracranial  hemorrhage or cerebral infarction. In patients with head trauma, the beneficial  effect of hypertonic saline on ICP was short-lasting, and after 72 hrs of  infusion, four patients required intravenous pentobarbital due to poor ICP  control. Among the 21 patients who had a repeat computed tomographic scan within  72 hrs of initiating hypertonic saline, lateral displacement of the brain was  reduced in patients with head trauma (2.8 +/- 1.4 to 1.1 +/- 0.9 [SEM]) and in  patients with postoperative edema (3.1 +/- 1.6 to 1.1 +/- 0.7). This effect was  not observed in patients with nontraumatic intracranial bleeding or cerebral  infarction. The treatment was terminated in three patients due to the development  of pulmonary edema, and was terminated in another three patients due to  development of diabetes insipidus. CONCLUSIONS: Hypertonic saline administration  as a 3% infusion appears to be a promising therapy for cerebral edema in patients  with head trauma or postoperative edema. Further studies are required to  determine the optimal duration of benefit and the specific patient population  that is most likely to benefit from this treatment.

AB  - Indomethacin-sensitive mechanisms involved in inducible heat shock protein 70 (iHSP 70) synthesis were investigated at 6 h after global cerebral ischemia in  parietal cortex and hippocampus. In anesthetized piglets, increased intracranial  pressure was used to produce 5 or 10 min of cerebral ischemia. Brain regions were  sampled for immunoblot analysis, immunohistochemistry and morphology. Immunoblots  revealed differential expression of iHSP 70 in untreated brains. Cerebellum  contained substantial amounts of iHSP 70 while lower levels were present in  parietal cortex and hippocampus. Detectable increases in iHSP 70 were observed at  2 h after ischemia in parietal cortex and hippocampus. Using immunoblot data,  calculation of percent change from control at 6 h after ischemia revealed  significant (p < 0.05) increases in iHSP 70 of 111 +/- 39% (x +/- sem) (n = 6) in  parietal cortex and 195 +/- 69% (n = 8) in hippocampus. Increased iHSP 70  immunoreactivity occurred primarily in the granular/subgranular area of the  dentate gyrus 6 h after ischemia. Histological staining revealed little cellular  injury at 6 h after ischemia in the granular/subgranular region injury whereas  the CA3 region, which lacked iHSP 70 staining, displayed modest cellular injury.  Cellular injury was also observed in cortical layers II/III and VI. At 6 h after  ischemia, indomethacin pretreatment (5 mg/kg, i.v.) attenuated the iHSP 70  increases in parietal cortex and hippocampus (7 +/- 30% and 89 +/- 30%,  respectively n = 5; p < 0.05 compared to ischemia). Also, the increase in iHSP 70  immunoreactivity and appearance of cellular injury were not detected with  indomethacin pretreatment. Thus, prior administration of indomethacin is  associated with attenuation of ischemia-induced increases in iHSP 70 and cellular  injury.

Histological staining revealed little cellular  injury at 6 h after ischemia in the granular/subgranular region injury whereas  the CA3 region, which lacked iHSP 70 staining, displayed modest cellular injury.  Cellular injury was also observed in cortical layers II/III and VI. At 6 h after  ischemia, indomethacin pretreatment (5 mg/kg, i.v.) attenuated the iHSP 70  increases in parietal cortex and hippocampus (7&plusmn;30% and 89&plusmn;30%,  respectively n=5; p<0.05 compared to ischemia). Also, the increase in iHSP 70  immunoreactivity and appearance of cellular injury were not detected with  indomethacin pretreatment. Thus, prior administration of indomethacin is  associated with attenuation of ischemia-induced increases in iHSP 70 and cellular  injury.

AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Partial liquid ventilation (PLV) with perfluorocarbons decreases pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) in injured piglet lungs without  supplemental oxygen. These PVR changes may result either from direct mechanical  effects or improved arterial oxygenation. In an uninjured hypoxic model of  elevated PVR the authors asked the following questions: (1) Does prophylactic or  therapeutic PLV ameliorate the PVR response to hypoxia? (2) Do prophylactic and  therapeutic PLV have different PVR effects? (3) Does supplemental oxygen modify  PVR response to PLV? METHODS: Piglet (3 to 4 kg) lungs were isolated in situ  without ischemia, hypoxia, or reperfusion injury. Pulmonary artery (PA) and left  atrial (LA) cannulae were attached to a blood-primed extracorporeal membrane  oxygenation (ECMO) perfusion circuit with a flow (QPA) of 80 mL/kg/min.  Pressure-limited, volume-cycled ventilation (PIP < 25 mm Hg, Tv = 15 mL/kg) was  initiated. PLV with perfluorodecalin (15 mL/kg) was administered endotracheally.  Continuously monitored blood gas parameters allowed airway and extracorporeal  adjustment of FiO2 to produce a PO2 appropriate to the experimental phase. PVR  was calculated as (PPA - PLA/QPA). After a stable 30-minute normoxic baseline,  animals were assigned randomly to three groups. In group I, control (n = 7), PVR  was measured for 150 minutes in hypoxic lungs (FiO2 = 0.07, PPAO2 = 40 mm Hg,  SPAO2 = 70%). In group II, prophylactic (n = 8), PLV was administered, followed  by 90 minutes of hypoxia, and 60 minutes of oxygen recovery (FiO2 = 0.21-0.30,  PPAO2 > 100 mm Hg, SPAO2 = 100%). In group III, therapeutic (n = 8), after 30  hypoxic minutes, PLV was administered and maintained for 90 minutes, followed by  a 60-minute oxygen recovery phase. Results were expressed as mean +/- SEM.  Statistical analysis of groups was performed by repeated measures of analysis of  variance (ANOVA) and Tukey correction. RESULTS: In group I normoxic  gas-ventilated PVR was 174+/-12 mm Hg/L/kg/min. After 90 hypoxic minutes PVR was  318+/-37 (P < .01 vbaseline). In group II baseline PVR was 183+/-14. PVR after 30  normoxic minutes of PLV was 199+/-14 (P = ns v baseline). After 90 hypoxic  minutes, PVR was 350+/-31 (P < .01 v baseline, and PLV alone) followed by a  decrease to 192+/-19 after 60 minutes of oxygen recovery (P = ns v baseline or  PLV alone). In group III baseline PVR was 160+/-17 and 325+/-29 after 30 hypoxic  minutes. After 90 hypoxic minutes of PLV, PVR was 366+/-22 (P = ns v hypoxia  control, P < .01 v normoxic baseline). PVR recovered to 189+/-19 after 60 minutes  of oxygen recovery (P = ns v baseline). CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic/therapeutic PLV  had no effect on hypoxia-induced increases in PVR and did not differ from each  other. Although PLV alone decreases PVR in the injured lung without supplemental  oxygen, elevated PVR associated with hypoxia was ameliorated only by supplemental  oxygen in the liquid ventilated lung.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if a dry fibrin sealant dressing (DFSD) will provide superior hemostasis when compared with regular gauze in a ballistic injury animal  model. DESIGN: A nonsurvival randomized goat study. SETTING: A federal biomedical  research institute. SUBJECTS: Eighteen anesthetized Angora goats. INTERVENTIONS:  Uncontrolled hemorrhage was induced by a complex ballistic extremity injury.  Control of hemorrhage was achieved by applying and holding pressure with the DFSD  or regular gauze for 2 minutes. The dressings were left in place for 1 hour. MAIN  OUTCOME MEASURES: Total blood loss, mean arterial pressure, ballistic injury, and  mortality were recorded after 1 hour. RESULTS: The injuries were equivalent for  the 2 groups. No animal mortality was seen. After 1 hour, the mean (+/-SEM) blood  loss was 124+/-64 mL in the DFSD-treated group and 377+/-64 mL in the gauze  dressings-treated group (P=.01). Twenty minutes after injury, the mean arterial  pressure was 95.0 mm Hg (+/-SEM, +/-4.7 mm Hg) in the DFSD-treated group and  70.0+/-5.0 mm Hg in the gauze dressings-treated group. The difference persisted  for the remainder of the study (P=.01). CONCLUSION: The DFSD was superior to  gauze in decreasing blood loss and maintaining blood pressure while retaining the  simplicity of standard dressing application.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that androgen depletion by castration before hemorrhage has protective effects on cell-mediated immunity in male mice after  soft tissue trauma and hemorrhagic shock. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether  treatment with an androgen receptor blocker (eg, flutamide) after  trauma-hemorrhage and sepsis has any salutary effects on cell-mediated immunity  and on the survival of male animals under those conditions. DESIGN: Male C3H/HeN  mice were either sham operated or subjected to hemorrhagic shock (mean [+/- SEM]  blood pressure, 35 +/- 5 mm Hg for 90 minutes) followed by adequate fluid  resuscitation (with shed blood and lactated Ringer solution). The animals then  received either vehicle or 25-mg/kg body weight flutamide subcutaneously  immediately after the resuscitation as well as 24 and 48 hours thereafter. At 48  hours after shock, sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture.  Sham-operated animals underwent laparotomy only. At 24 hours after cecal ligation  and puncture, the animals were killed, blood was collected, and splenocytes and  splenic macrophages were harvested to produce nonadherent and adherent cultures.  Splenocytes were evaluated for splenocyte proliferation and interleukin 2  release, while interleukin 1 and interleukin 6 release were assayed in splenic  macrophages. Plasma testosterone and corticosterone levels were also measured by  radioimmunoassay. In a separate set of experiments, survival was measured over a  period of 9 days after the induction of sepsis. RESULTS: Hemorrhage followed by  sepsis produced a significant (P < .05) depression of splenocyte and macrophage  functions in vehicle-treated animals. In contrast, animals treated with flutamide  showed markedly improved immune functions, as evidenced by restoration of  splenocyte proliferation, interleukin 2 release, splenic macrophage interleukin 1  release, and improvement of splenic macrophage interleukin 6 release. Plasma  corticosterone levels were notably elevated while testosterone levels were  depressed after hemorrhage and the induction of sepsis. The survival rate of the  animals in the flutamide-treated group was also notably higher than the survival  rate of animals in the vehicle-treated group subjected to hemorrhage and sepsis.  CONCLUSION: The findings that flutamide not only markedly improves the depressed  immune functions but also the survival of animals after hemorrhage and the  induction of sepsis suggest that the short-term administration of androgen  receptor blocker in males after trauma represents a safe and novel approach for  preventing immune deficiency and decreasing the mortality rate from subsequent  sepsis.

T2  - The Journal of physiology
AB  - 1. Laser Doppler perfusion imaging was used to assess the role of the sympathetic nervous system in the control of blood flow to the medial collateral ligament and  capsule (synovium and overlying fibrous tissues) of the rabbit knee joint. 2.  Electrical stimulation of the saphenous nerve (width 1 ms; amplitude 20V; 1-30  Hz) produced a frequency-dependent vasoconstriction of knee joint vasculature.  The response was maximal at 30 Hz and gave the greatest fall in perfusion at the  femoral insertion of the ligament (by 33.8 +/- 7.4%, mean +/- S.E.M.; n = 5-6)  and the smallest decrease at the tibial insertion of the ligament (by 10.6 +/-  2.9%). 3. Topical application of phentolamine (10(-6) mol) had no significant  effect on basal knee joint blood flow. However, it abolished the nerve-mediated  constrictor responses in all regions of the medial collateral ligament and  synovium at all frequencies. 4. Topical administration of adrenaline (10(-14) to  10(-7) mol) caused a dose-dependent decrease in knee joint blood flow with the  highest dose producing > 75% reduction in perfusion at all areas. 5. There was no  evidence of a reactive hyperaemia in the 5 min following a 5 min period of  femoral artery occlusion. Artificial manipulation of arterial blood pressure by  intravenous infusion or withdrawal of blood caused a proportional change in  ligament and synovial blood flow. These observations may indicate a lack of  autoregulation in the joint and its exclusion from baroreflex modulation. 6.  These results suggest a potential role for the sympathetic nervous system in the  control of knee joint blood flow. Neuromodulation of ligament perfusion appears  to predominate at the femoral insertion and this could prove to have functional  significance.

AB  - Stress-induced structural damage is often accompanied by sound release. This behavior is known as acoustic emission (AE). We hypothesize that vascular injury  such as that produced by balloon angioplasty is associated with AE. Postmortem  human peripheral arterial specimens were randomly partitioned into test (n = 10)  and control segments (n = 10). Test segments were inserted into a pressurization  circuit and subjected to two consecutive hydrostatic pressurizations. Amplitude,  frequency, and energy content of the AE signals released during pressurization  were quantified. Test and matched control segments subsequently underwent  identical histological processing. Pressure-induced tissue trauma was estimated  via computerized histomorphometric analysis of the resulting slides (n = 100).  Vascular acoustic emission (VAE) signals exhibited an amplitude range of +/- 5.0  mu bars and were observed to occur during periods of increasing intraluminal  pressure. The VAE signal power within the monitored bandwidth was concentrated  below 350 Hz. More than 25 times as much VAE energy was released during the first  pressurization as during the second: 1,855 +/- 513.8 mJ vs. 73 +/- 44.9 mJ (mean  +/- SEM, p < 0.006). Estimates of circumferential intimal wall stress at AE onset  averaged 170 kPa, slightly below reported values of arterial tissue rupture  strength. Histomorphometric estimates of tissue trauma was greater for the test  than their matched control segments (p < 0.0001). These preliminary data suggest  that detectable acoustic energy is released by vascular tissue subjected to  therapeutic stress levels. Histological analysis suggest that the underlying  source of sound energy may be related to tissue trauma, independent of  histological preparation artifacts. From this preliminary work, we conclude that  VAE may be a fundamental property accompanying vascular tissue trauma, which may  have applications to improving balloon angioplasty outcomes.

AB  - In addition to having anti-ischaemic effects, halothane can protect isolated rat hearts and isolated cardiomyocytes against reperfusion injury of the "oxygen  paradox" type. The aim of this study was to investigate if halothane can also  protect against myocardial reperfusion injury in vivo. Twenty-two rabbits  anaesthetized with alpha-chloralose underwent 30 min of occlusion of a major  coronary artery and 2 h of subsequent reperfusion. Seven animals received 1 MAC  of halothane for the first 15 min of reperfusion (halothane group), and eight  animals served as untreated controls (controls group). In seven additional  animals, the haemodynamic effects of halothane were antagonized by an i.v.  infusion of noradrenaline (halothane-noradrenaline group). We measured cardiac  output (CO) by an ultrasonic flow probe around the ascending aorta, left  ventricular pressure (LVP) by a tip manometer and infarct size by  triphenyltetrazolium staining. Baseline LVP was mean 92 (SEM 4) mm Hg and CO was  289 (16) ml min-1. During coronary occlusion, LVP was reduced to 86 (4)% of  baseline and CO to 84 (4)% (similar in all groups). During halothane  administration at reperfusion, LVP declined further to 55 (6)% of baseline and CO  to 66 (9)% (P < 0.05 halothane group vs control group). Noradrenaline prevented  the reduction in LVP (halothane-noradrenaline group 87 (5)% of baseline, control  group 84 (6)% and reduction in CO (halothane-noradrenaline group 89 (5)%, control  group 83 (6)%. Infarct size was 49 (6)% of the area at risk in controls and was  reduced markedly by administration of halothane to 32 (3)% in the halothane group  (P < 0.05) and to 30 (3)% in the halothane-noradrenaline group (P < 0.05).  Treatment with halothane during the early reperfusion period after myocardial  ischaemia protected the myocardium against infarction in vivo, independent of the  haemodynamic effect of halothane.

AB  - In common with halogenated anaesthetics, nicorandil, a new KATP channel opener, has been shown to have cardioprotective and vasodilator effects. Recent studies  have also suggested that the vasodilator and protective effects of halogenated  anaesthetics are mediated partly via KATP channel opening. This study examined  the effects of concurrent administration of nicorandil and isoflurane on  haemodynamic state and ventricular function before, during and after 15 min of  ischaemia. We studied left ventricular function in 40 anaesthetized rabbits using  ultrasonomicrometry. Measurements were obtained before, during and after 15 min  of regional ischaemia. Regional ventricular function was assessed in terms of  systolic shortening (SS%) and preload recruitable work area (PRWA, the area  beneath the regional stroke work vs end-diastolic length relationship) during  reperfusion. Four groups were studied: group F (n = 10) received a bolus dose of  fentanyl 100 micrograms kg-1 and then 400 micrograms kg-1 h-1 throughout; group 1  (n = 10) received 2.05% end-tidal concentration of isoflurane (1 MAC); group FN  (n = 10) received fentanyl, a bolus does of nicorandil 100 micrograms kg-1 and  then 25 micrograms kg-1 min-1, 15 min before occlusion; and group IN (n = 10)  received isoflurane and nicorandil. Isoflurane decreased left ventricular  systolic pressure and ventricular contractility (+dP/dtmax, slope of preload  recruitable stroke work, and SS%). Nicorandil increased -dP/dtmax in group FN.  Post-ischaemic regional left ventricular contractility in group I did not differ  from that in group F, however, groups receiving nicorandil recovered to a greater  extent. Group IN showed better recovery compared with all other groups when  ventricular contractility was assessed by PRWA normalized to pre-occlusion values  (mean 99.3 (SEM 10.5)% vs 73.4 (7.5)%, 50.2 (5.8)% and 52.4 (3.7)% at 120 min  reperfusion in groups FN, I and F, respectively). Tissue ATP and lactate contents  did not differ between groups. We conclude that concurrent administration of  nicorandil and isoflurane enhanced post-ischaemic recovery compared with  isoflurane anaesthesia or nicorandil and fentanyl administration.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the optimal dosing of doxacurium as a continuous infusion in neurosurgical patients with traumatic brain injury; to determine the  effects of bolus administration of doxacurium on heart rate (HR), blood pressure  (BP), and intracranial pressure (ICP); to monitor neuromuscular recovery after  discontinuation of prolonged doxacurium infusion; and to compare the cost of  doxacurium with other current neuromuscular blocking drugs. DESIGN: Prospective,  open-label study. SETTING: Neurosurgical intensive care unit (ICU) of a  university-affiliated teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Eight critically ill,  mechanically ventilated patients with traumatic head injury and normal renal and  hepatic function. Patients had ICP monitoring. INTERVENTIONS: A bolus injection  of doxacurium (0.05 mg/kg) followed by a continuous infusion (0.015 mg/kg/hr),  adjusted to maintain one twitch during Train-of-Four nerve stimulation of the  adductor pollicis muscle. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Bolus injections of  doxacurium did not alter the HR, BP, or ICP. Patients were paralyzed 66 +/- 12  (SEM) hrs, with recovery of the fourth twitch occurring 118 +/- 19 mins after  infusion of the doxacurium was discontined. There were no incidences of prolonged  weakness, myopathy, or other adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous infusion of  doxacurium provides stable neuromuscular blockade for neurosurgical patients with  traumatic brain injury. Doxacurium is devoid of clinically important interactions  with HR, BP, or ICP and is less costly than other neuromuscular blockers used in  the ICU.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Surgical trauma results in diffuse sympathoadrenal activation which is thought to contribute to perioperative cardiovascular complications in high-risk  patients. Regional anesthetic and analgesic techniques can attenuate this "stress  response" and reduce the occurrence rate of adverse perioperative events;  however, their use in the postoperative period is logistically difficult and  costly. The present study was undertaken to evaluate whether transdermal  administration of the alpha2 adrenergic-receptor agonist, clonidine, can be used  as a pharmacologic means of blunting the stress response throughout the  perioperative period. DESIGN: Double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in  patients undergoing pancreatico-biliary surgery. SETTING: Operating rooms and  surgical intensive care unit of a major university teaching hospital. PATIENTS:  Forty patients scheduled for major upper abdominal surgery. INTERVENTIONS:  Patients received either clonidine (0.2 mg orally and a clonidine TTS-3 patch the  evening before surgery and 0.3 mg orally on call to the operating room) or  matched oral and transdermal placebo. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Heart rate,  systemic arterial blood pressure, plasma catecholamine, clonidine, interleukin-6  concentrations, and 24-hr urine cortisol and nitrogen excretion were measured the  day before surgery and daily thereafter for 72 hrs postoperatively. Preoperative  transdermal (and oral) clonidine administration resulted in therapeutic plasma  clonidine concentrations throughout the perioperative period (1.54 +/- .07 [SEM]  microg/mL). Clonidine reduced preoperative epinephrine and norepinephrine  concentrations by 65%. Plasma catecholamine concentrations increased in both  groups following surgery but were markedly lower throughout the postoperative  period in patients receiving clonidine. Patients receiving clonidine had a  reduced frequency rate of postoperative hypertension. Clonidine had no effect on  plasma interleukin-6 concentration, urine cortisol excretion, or urine nitrogen  excretion. No adverse effects of clonidine administration were observed.  CONCLUSIONS: The combined administration of oral and transdermal clonidine  effectively attenuated the catecholamine response to surgical stress throughout  the postoperative study period. Clonidine administration produced specific  sympatholytic effects, since other elements of the stress response were not  attenuated. Undesirable side effects were not noted. The sustained sympatholytic  effects we observed suggest that alpha2 adrenergic-receptor agonists may offer a  pharmacologic means of modifying the sympathoadrenal response to injury, and may  be useful in reducing perioperative complications.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the fact that swimming is often recommended for the prevention and treatment of hypertension, no study has examined the potential  efficacy of regular swimming exercise for lowering the blood pressure in  hypertensive humans. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that regular swimming  exercise lowers the resting blood pressure. DESIGN: A 10-week closely supervised  swimming training program compared with a non-exercising control group. PATIENTS:  Eighteen previously sedentary men and women [aged 48 +/- 2 years (mean +/- SEM)]  with stage 1 or 2 essential hypertension. RESULTS: The resting heart rated, an  index of cardiovascular adaptation, decreased in the swimming training group from  81 +/- 4 to 71 +/- 3 beats/min (P < 0.01). The body mass and body fat percentage  did not show statistically significant changes. The systolic blood pressure of  patients in the seated position fell significantly (P < 0.05) from 150 +/- 5 to  144 +/- 4 mmHg. The seated diastolic blood pressure did not change significantly.  A similar magnitude of reductions in systolic blood pressure (P < 0.05) was also  found in patients in the supine position. No significant changes in plasma  catecholamine concentrations, casual forearm vascular resistance, plasma volume  and blood volume were observed. There were no significant changes in any of these  variables in the control group. CONCLUSION: Swimming training elicits significant  reductions in arterial blood pressure at rest in individuals with hypertension.  This is a clinically important finding since swimming can be a highly useful  alternative to land-based exercises for hypertensive patients with obesity,  exercise-induced asthma, or orthopedic injuries.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral arteriolar dilation to N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) is drastically reduced by anoxic stress. The effects of anoxic stress on  cerebrovascular dilation to activation of other types of glutamate receptors are  unknown. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of ischemia on  cerebral arteriolar responses to kainate in anesthetized piglets. METHODS:  Arteriolar responses to 5 x 10(-5) mol/L and 10(-4) mol/L kainate were evaluated  before and 10 minutes after total, global ischemia. Ischemia was induced by  increasing intracranial pressure. We measured pial arteriolar diameters  (approximately 100 microns) using a cranial window and intravital microscopy.  RESULTS: Before ischemia, kainate dilated arterioles by 16 +/- 2% at 5 x 10%  mol/L and 30 +/- 2% at 10(-4) mol/L (mean +/- SEM; n = 6). After ischemia, the  diameter of arterioles increased by 17 +/- 3% and 26 +/- 3% to 5 x 10% and 10(-4)  mol/L kainate, respectively (P > .05). We also investigated the mechanisms  involved in mediating arteriolar dilation to kainate. Intravenous administration  of N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) (15 mg/kg) (n = 7) or  indomethacin (10 mg/kg) (n = 6) individually reduced arteriolar dilation to  kainate by approximately one half. Coadministration of L-NAME and indomethacin  almost completely eliminated arteriolar dilation to kainate (n = 10).  Administration of theophylline (20 mg/kg IV) did not affect dilator responses to  kainate (n = 7). Blockade of NMDA receptors by MK801 had minimal effects on  arteriolar dilation to kainate (n = 6). CONCLUSIONS: There are three main  findings from this study: (1) kainate is a potent dilator agent in the neonatal  cerebral circulation; (2) nitric oxide and prostaglandins both participate in the  vasodilator response to kainate; and (3) in contrast to NMDA, cerebral arteriolar  dilator responses to kainate are resistant to ischemic stress.

AB  - To further describe the pathophysiologic processes that occur in infants and young children after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), we retrospectively  reviewed the cerebral blood flow (CBF) values and 6-month Glasgow Outcome Scores  (GOS) in 30 children < or = 8 years old (25 were < or = 4 years old) with a  Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) on admission of < or = 8. Twelve females and 18 males  (mean age 2.1 years, range 1 month to 8 years) underwent 61 CBF studies using  stable xenon computed tomography at variable times from admission to 9 days after  TBI. In 12 patients, PaCO2 was manipulated an average of 8.4 torr (range 5-11  torr) and a second CBF study performed to determine CO2 vasoreactivity (CO2VR),  defined as the percent change in CBF per torr change in PaCO2. CBF on admission  (n = 13)was 25.1+/-7.7 ml/100 g/min (mean +/- SEM) and was < or = 20 ml/100 g/min  in 10 of 13 patients (77%). By 24 h and for up to 6 days after TBI, the mean CBF  increased to 55.3+/-3.4 ml/100 g/min (range 2-95) which differed significantly  from the admission CBF value (p < 0.05); a CBF of >70 ml/100 g/min tended to be  associated with a good outcome. Poor outcome (GOS < or = 3) was seen uniformly in  children under the age of 1 year and in patients with a CBF of < or = 20 ml/100  g/min any time after TBI. Poor outcome was seen in 85% of children under the age  of 24 months, but in only 41% of children > or = 24 months old. Mean CO2VR was  2.1+/-0.6%/torr PaCO2 and ranged from 0.02 to 5.98%. Mean CO2VR tended to differ  between good and poor outcome children (3.2+/-0.9 and 1.17+/-0.2%, respectively)  and a CO2VR of < or = 2% was significantly associated with a poor outcome.  Younger age, low CBF in the early period after TBI, and a CO2VR of <2% was  associated with a poor outcome in this subgroup of children. Young children (<24  months) may represent a particular high-risk group with early hypoperfusion after  severe TBI. This finding may be a key factor in the pathophysiology and outcome  in this age group, and may need to be addressed in our future therapeutic  protocols.

AB  - Recent clinical and experimental studies have suggested that antioxidant supplements might actually have harmful as well as beneficial effects in the  setting of cardiovascular disease. The mechanisms underlying the beneficial  effects of the various antioxidants are poorly understood in humans.  Reperfusion-associated myocardial injury, and particularly the phenomenon of  stunning, is important because it occurs in clinical settings and may condition  the prognosis after short ischemic insult. We studied the effects of chronic (3  months) alpha-tocopherol supplementation with a large oral dose (500 mg daily) on  myocardial contractility (stunning) and ventricular arrhythmias in a dog model of  short ischemia followed by reperfusion. Twenty dogs were randomized to either an  alpha-tocopherol supplemented or a control group. After 3 months, dogs were  anesthetized and underwent a 20-min coronary artery occlusion followed by  reperfusion. Myocardial regional blood flow was measured by the radioactive  microsphere technique and myocardial contractility by sonomicrometry. Plasma  alpha-tocopherol was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography in all  dogs. Twelve dogs (seven supplemented and five controls) developed ventricular  fibrillation at reperfusion, showing no difference between groups. Hemodynamic  parameters, blood flow in the ischemic area (collateral flow), and area at risk  were similar in the two groups. Regional systolic segment shortening in the  ischemic area was similar during ischemia and reperfusion in both groups,  representing 41 +/- 15% (mean +/- SEM) of baseline contractility in controls and  51 +/- 8% in supplemented dogs after 150 min of reperfusion. Plasma  alpha-tocopherol level was higher in supplemented than in controls (19.1 +/- 1.6  and 6.9 +/- 0.6 mg/L; p < 0.001). Thus a long-term large dose of alpha-tocopherol  had no significant effect on postischaemic ventricular arrhythmias and  dysfunction (myocardial stunning) in this canine model. These data suggest that  if alpha-tocopherol supplementation might be useful to improve the prognosis of  coronary patients, it is likely not by interfering with the stunning phenomenon.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Early morbidity and mortality post cardiac transplantation is frequently caused by right ventricular failure; this is usually attributed to an  elevated pulmonary vascular resistance in the recipient. Brain death in the donor  is recognised as causing left ventricular dysfunction, but its effects on the  right ventricle have not previously been studied. The aim of this study was to  investigate right ventricular function following brain death, using a canine  model. METHODS: The hearts of 33 dogs were instrumented with micromanometers,  flow probes and dimension transducers to measure minor/major axes, and right and  left ventricular free wall to septal distances. Left ventricular volume was  calculated according to the prolate ellipsoid model and right ventricular volume  was calculated according to the shell subtraction method. Systolic function for  left and right ventricles was analysed by plotting ventricular stroke work vs.  end-diastolic volume during a caval occlusion (preload-independent recruitable  stroke work PRSW). Brain death was instigated by inflation of a subdurally placed  intracranial balloon; subsequently blood pressure was maintained with intravenous  fluid whilst no inotropic medications were given. Data were collected at  baseline, and at 2 and 4 h thereafter. A two-tailed paired Student's t-test was  applied to compare post-brain death data with baseline measurements. RESULTS: All  animals had an initial hyperdynamic response post brain death ensued by the  development of diabetes insipidus. Brain stem death was validated by  neuropathological examination at the termination of the experiments. Right and  left ventricular systolic function had deteriorated significantly 2 h post brain  death by 34.4% (+/- 5.1%, P < 0.001) and 20.4% (+/- 3.4%, P < 0.001),  respectively, from baseline PRSW [RV = 23.6 erg.10(3) (+/- 1.5), LV = 76.2  erg.10(3) (+/- 3.5)]. This deterioration remained at 4 h post brain death (29.4%  (+/- 4.9%, P < 0.001) and 21.2% (+/- 4.3%, P < 0.001), respectively). (The  results are expressed as mean and S.E.M.). CONCLUSIONS: Brain death causes a  significant decrease in left and right ventricular function. The injury to the  right ventricle is more prominent than the left ventricle, and at 2 h post brain  death it is significantly greater. Failure of the right ventricle post  transplantation in clinical practice may be related to this brain death induced  injury. Further studies are required to investigate the mechanisms of this  injury.

AB  - Three forms of non-injurious ischemic preconditioning were tested for their effects on endogenous antioxidant activity and subsequent ischemic injury. Test  ischemia alone, consisting of 1 h occlusion of both carotid arteries (BCAs) and  one middle cerebral artery (MCA), elicited an average volume of cerebral  infarction of 143.4 +/- 15.0 mm3 (mean +/- s.e.m.). Twenty minutes occlusion of  the MCA only or MCA and BCAs (but not BCAs only) 24 h before test ischemia  significantly increased the activity of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide  dismutase and significantly reduced the cerebral infarction volume. These  findings demonstrate that brief focal ischemia can attenuate the injurious impact  of subsequent ischemia and that an upregulation of endogenous antioxidant  activity may play a key role in this neuroprotective effect.

AB  - To investigate the mechanism of barotrauma to the inner ear, we used electrophysiologic methods to evaluate guinea pigs exposed to such trauma, and  compared the findings with those observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).  Guinea pigs with good Preyer's reflexes were studied. In those animals that  showed a loss of or decrease in Preyer's reflexes and/or nystagmus following  exposure to an increase and decrease in pressures in a high-pressure chamber, we  measured compound action potentials (CAPs) and cochlear microphonics (CMs) 7-11  days after the exposure. The pressure was increased from 1 ATA to 2 ATA over 30  sec and maintained for 10 min, then pressure was decreased to 1 ATA over 30 sec.  Specimens obtained from animals in which CAPs and CMs could be measured were  prepared for SEM examination. CAPs and CMs were measured at decreasing 5 dB  increments to the visual threshold level of detection with tone bursts at 1, 2, 4  and 8 kHz. Based on the CAPs measured 7-11 days after exposure, guinea pigs were  divided into two groups by CAP thresholds, those with severe damage and those  with mild damage. None of the animals showed moderate damage. The group with high  CAP thresholds showed severe damage to hair cells on SEM, while the group with  low CAP thresholds showed no specific morphological abnormalities on SEM. It  appeared that some guinea pigs with normal SEM findings following barotrauma to  the inner ear did not achieve complete recovery of hearing. From these results,  it was speculated that some animals had sustained reversible damage in the mild  group and that these animals had recovered from moderate damage. The elevation of  CMs was usually not high compared to that of CAPs in the high frequency area, and  4 animals showed CAP and CM separation above 30 dB at 8 kHz. These findings  suggested that the group with severe damage exhibited multiple patterns of  injury.

AB  - Radiocontrast agents and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used for the diagnosis and treatment of renal colic. We studied their  impact during unilateral acute urinary outflow obstruction upon renal  microcirculation and parenchymal integrity. Laser-Doppler and ultrasonic regional  flow measurements demonstrated selective decline of outer medullary blood flow by  23 +/- 2% during an acute increase of intra-pelvic pressure to 50 to 55 cm H2O (N  = 28, X +/- SEM, P < 0.01). In rats preconditioned with indomethacin, this  manipulation reduced medullary blood flow by 50 +/- 4% (N = 16, P < 0.01 vs.  obstruction alone), with cortical and total renal blood flow declining by 18 +/-  4% and 16 +/- 2%, respectively (P < 0.01). Unilateral obstruction alone for 24  hours in intact rats resulted in injury (hemorrhage and necrosis) to the papilla  and fornix (formed laterally by inner stripe and medially by the inner medulla).  These changes were detected as early as 30 minutes after ureteral ligature by  staining for fragmented nuclear DNA (TUNEL). Mild damage of thick ascending limbs  (mTALs) was associated with substantial medial fornix injury. Indomethacin  markedly increased mTAL injury in obstructed kidneys, but attenuated inner  medullary damage, both in the medial border of the urinary space and at the  papilla. This latter protective effect, probably mediated by the decrease in  intrapelvic pressure, was blunted by concomitant intravenous fluid load. Contrast  media (iothalamate) and L-NAME (N omega nitro-L-arginine methyl ester) both  augmented inner stripe and inner medullary damage in hydronephrotic kidneys. In  rats concomitantly subjected to radiocontrast, indomethacin and L-NAME (an acute  renal failure protocol, J Clin Invest 94:1069, 1994), unilateral obstruction  augmented inner stripe hypoxic damage (65 +/- 6% vs. 24 +/- 11% of mTALs in  contralateral kidneys, N = 7, P < 0.01). Injury was maximal at the fornix (93 +/-  6% vs. 39 +/- 14% of mTALs in the mid-inner stripe, P < 0.01) and extended to the  outer stripe and medullary rays. Thus, in the rat acute ureteral obstruction  alters medullary blood flow and within 24 hours produces medullary damage in both  forniceal and inner medullary locations, that is exacerbated by concomitant  measures which limit medullary oxygenation. Contrast studies, forced hydration  and NSAIDs for renal colic are potentially harmful and their use should be  re-evaluated.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Partial liquid ventilation (PLV) with perfluorocarbons can be advantageous in treating lung injury. We studied this phenomenon in isolated  piglet lungs devoid of systemic detractors by studying the changes in pulmonary  vascular resistance (PVR) after lung injury with and without PLV. The following  questions were asked. (1) Does PLV alone affect PVR in the uninjured lung? (2)  Does PLV prevent the increase in PVR associated with oleic acid-induced lung  injury? (3) Does PLV modify the increase in PVR associated with oleic acid lung  injury? (4) Are the prophylactic and therapeutic effects of PLV on the increased  PVR associated with oleic acid-induced lung injury different? METHODS: Neonatal  piglet (3 to 4 kg) lungs were prepared without pulmonary ischemia, hypoxia, or  reperfusion injury for in situ study. Before pulmonary vascular isolation (eg,  aortic and ductus arteriosus ligation) the pulmonary artery (PA) and left atrium  (LA) were cannulated and attached to a blood-primed perfusion circuit (flow; 80  mL/kg/min). Pressure-limited volume-cycled ventilation (FiO2, 0.21; TV, 15 mL/kg;  PIP, 25 cm H2O) was accomplished via occlusive tracheostomy. Blood gas parameters  were monitored continuously and maintained within normal range (SpaO2, 75%; pH,  7.35 to 7.45; pCO2, 35 to 45 torr). Pulmonary artery pressure (Ppa), left atrial  pressure (PLa) and pulmonary blood flow (Qpa) were recorded and PVR calculated  (PVR = Ppa - Pla/Qpa). After achieving a stable baseline with gas ventilation  only, the animal preparations were assigned to one of the following four groups.  In group 1 (n = 7) PLV was given alone, using endotracheally administered  perfluorodecalin (15 mL/kg). In group 2 (Prophylactic, n = 7) PLV was given  prophylactically 60 minutes before lung injury induced by injecting oleic acid  (OA) at 0.08 mL/kg into the pulmonary artery. In group 3 (Therapeutic, n = 8) PLV  was given 60 minutes after OA-induced lung injury. PPA, PLA, and QPA were  measured and PVR was calculated. In group 4 (n = 7) OA was given alone.  Significance of differences between groups was obtained by repeated measures  analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results were expressed as mean +/- SEM (mm  Hg/L/Kg). RESULTS: Group I showed baseline PVR of the normoxic gas ventilated  animals was 127 +/- 19 mm Hg/L/kg. PVR 180 minutes after PLV administration was  160 +/- 15 mm Hg/L/kg (P = ns v baseline). In group 2 after OA infusion, PVR  increased from 109 +/- 13 to 281 +/- 26 mm Hg/L/kg (P < .01 v baseline), and 60  minutes later, PVR decreased to 193 +/- 22 mm Hg/L/kg (P < .05 v OA). In group 3  PVR on gas ventilation, before lung injury, was 137 +/- 28 mm Hg/L/kg. Sixty  minutes after OA infusion, PVR increased to 314 +/- 23 mm Hg/L/kg (P < .01 v  baseline). After 60 additional minutes of PLV, PVR decreased to 201 +/- 31 mm  Hg/L/kg, (P < .05 v maximum). In group 4 baseline PVR was 96 +/- 16 mm Hg/L/kg.  After 120 minutes of OA injection, PVR increased to 414 +/- 20 mm Hg/L/kg (P <  .01 v baseline). Endpoint analysis of PVR at the conclusion of the recording  interval showed no difference between group 2 and group 3 (P = not significant  [ns]). CONCLUSIONS: (1) PLV does not significantly after PVR in the uninjured  lung when given for 2 hours; (2) prophylactic administration of PLV prevents the  sustained increase in PVR known to be induced by OA injury; (3) PLV abates  OA-induced elevation in PVR when given therapeutically after injury; and (4)  Prophylactic and therapeutic PLV have similar effects on PVR in the OA-injured  lung.

AB  - Experimental glaucoma was induced in 1 eye of 6 cynomolgus monkeys by laser treatment of the trabecular meshwork. In 5 of the 6 monkeys the increased  intraocular pressure (IOP) caused marked glaucomatous damage in the experimental  eye. Ocular blood flow was determined with labeled microspheres 4 years after the  laser treatment. IOP was regulated with an external reservoir. With the same  perfusion pressure in both eyes no statistically significant difference was  observed between the 2 eyes for total ocular blood flow or for blood flow through  any of the ocular tissues. Total ocular blood flow was 343.5 +/- 61.4 mg/min  (mean +/- SEM) in the control eye and 385.3 +/- 107.7 mg/min in the experimental  eye.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Brief ischemic periods render the myocardium resistant to infarction from subsequent ischemic insults by a process called ischemic preconditioning.  Volatile anesthetics have also been shown to be cardioprotective if administered  before ischemia. The effect of preconditioning alone and combined with halothane  or isoflurane on hemodynamic recovery and preservation of adenosine triphosphate  content in isolated rat hearts was evaluated. METHODS: Seven groups of isolated  rat hearts (n = 6 each) were perfused in a retrograde manner at constant  temperature and pressure. A latex balloon was placed in the left ventricle to  obtain isovolumetric contraction. Heart rhythm, coronary flow, left ventricular  pressure and its derivative dP/dt (positive and negative), and developed pressure  were monitored. The hearts were paced at 300 beats per minute. Each heart was  randomly allocated to (1) a time-control group that received no ischemia, (2) an  untreated group that received 25 min of normothermic ischemia only. (3 and 4) an  isoflurane group and a halothane group that received 40 min of anesthetic (2.2%  and 1.5%, respectively) before ischemia; (5) a preconditioning group that  received two 5-min periods of ischemia separated by 10 min of reperfusion before  ischemia; or (6 and 7) a isoflurane+preconditioning group and a  halothane+preconditioning group that received anesthetic for 10 min at  concentrations of 2.2% or 1.5%, respectively, before two 5-min periods of  ischemia separated by 10 min of reperfusion. All treated groups received 25 min  of normothermic ischemia followed by 30 min of reperfusion. RESULTS: The  time-control group remained hemodynamically stable for the entire experiment, and  the adenosine triphosphate content was 18.3 +/- 1.7 (SEM) microM/g at the end of  115 min. The untreated group had depressed recovery after 25 min of normothermic  ischemia, and the developed pressure was significantly depressed and recovered  only 30 +/- 9% (P < 0.001) of its preischemic value. There was also a significant  increase in the incidence of ventricular fibrillation (P < 0.001). Adenosine  triphosphate content was significantly lower in this group than in all other  groups. Five minutes of ischemia in the preconditioning group had little effect  on hemodynamics and decreased developed pressure only 6.4%. Halothane depressed  developed pressure by 16 +/- 5% (P < 0.001), and isoflurane increased coronary  flow by 145 +/- 9% (P < 0.001) but had no significant hemodynamic effect. The  treated groups had significantly better recovery of postischemic function than  did the untreated group. In the preconditioning group, developed pressure  recovered to 85% of control and dP/dt+ to 87% of control. The addition of  halothane or isoflurane to preconditioning did not provide additional functional  recovery but did increase the level of adenosine triphosphate preservation (13.1  +/- 1.1 and 12.4 +/- 1.1 microM/g, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The results  indicate that preconditioning, halothane, and isoflurane provide significant  protection against ischemia. The combination of preconditioning and halothane or  isoflurane did not improve hemodynamic recovery but did increase preservation of  adenosine triphosphate.

TI  - The yeast to hyphal transition following hematogenous candidiasis induces shock and organ injury independent of circulating tumor necrosis factor-alpha.
AU  - Matuschak, G. M.
AU  - Lechner, A. J.
T2  - Critical care medicine
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Dimorphic Candida albicans spp. increasingly cause lethal septic shock and disseminated infection in the critically ill. Following candidemia,  production of specific fungal exotoxins coincident with the yeast to hyphal  phenotypic transition is believed to be important in the pathogenesis of Candida  septic shock. However, overexpression of the pleiotropic cytokine tumor necrosis  factor (TNF)-alpha by the host following hyphal germination is also thought to be  a mechanism of Candida-related cardiopulmonary dysfunction, as well as of  bacteremic shock. In this study, we hypothesized that increases in circulating  TNF-alpha coinciding with the yeast to hyphal transition modulate the onset and  progression of shock with multiple organ injury early after hematogenous  candidiasis. DESIGN: Prospective, controlled laboratory animal study. SETTING:  University hospital animal research facility. SUBJECTS: Pathogen-free, male  Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 26). INTERVENTIONS: Conscious, antibiotic-treated  animals with chronic indwelling carotid arterial and jugular venous catheters  were intravenously infected with 10(9) viable blastoconidia of the C. albicans  clinical pathogen, CA-MEN (n = 10), over 30 mins and ending at t = 0 hr, compared  with an equivalent inoculum of its viable agerminative mutant, CA-MM2002 n = 11),  or an intravenous infusion of 0.9% sodium chloride (n = 5). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN  RESULTS: Mean arterial pressure (MAP), pulse rate, respiratory frequency, rectal  temperature, acid-base status, quantitative blood cultures, circulating alanine  aminotransferase (ALT), and bioactive TNF-alpha were serially measured in all  three groups over 24 hrs or until death. Organ cultures, wet/dry weight ratios,  and histopathologic changes in the lungs, heart, liver, and kidneys were  determined in Candida-infected and 0.9% sodium chloride (normal saline)-infused  subgroups at 6 and 24 hrs. Animals hematogenously infected with the C. albicans  clinical isolate developed lethal nonendotoxemic shock in < or = 6 hrs (MAP 49  +/- 7 mm Hg [SEM]; p < .05 vs. t = 0 hr), and at death (7.0 +/- 0.3 hrs) were  acidotic, hypocapnic, and hypothermic (rectal temperature 33.2 +/- 0.7 degrees  C). Despite similar peak concentrations of circulating fungal colony-forming  units (cfu) and kinetics of vascular clearance in both Candida-infected groups,  survival and MAP in rats challenged with the agerminative C. albicans mutant were  unchanged for > 8 hrs, as were pH, Pco2, and rectal temperature. No germination  of the agerminative fungal strain occurred in vivo over 6 hrs. Serum TNF was  nearly undetectable at t = 0 hr in all three groups. Although shock developed  soon after fungemia with the C. albicans clinical isolate, TNF-alpha  concentrations did not increase above normal saline values in either candidemic  group at t = 1.5, 4.5, or 6 hrs (17 +/- 7 vs. 14 +/- 1 U/mL in the parent C.  albicans organism vs. its agerminative mutant at t = 6 hrs). Greater numbers of  agerminative C. albicans than its dimorphic parent strain were recovered from the  lungs (5.41 +/- 1.0 vs. 2.02 +/- 0.38 x 10(7) cfu/g, respectively; p < .05) and  kidneys (p < .01). By 24 hrs, modest germination of the mutant Candida strain was  observed in the tissues. However, lung wet/dry ratios, intrapulmonary hyphal  proliferation, and alveolar hemorrhage were all greater after infection with the  parent fungal isolate. Likewise, myocardial necrosis and hepatic glycogen  depletion with vacuolization were more severe after infection with the C.  albicans clinical isolate vs. candidemia with its agerminative mutant, although  serum ALT values did not differ between these groups. CONCLUSIONS: Lethal C.  albicans sepsis with lung injury and multiple organ damage are temporally  associated with the in vivo yeast to hyphal transition in this model. However,  this candidemic septic shock syndrome is modulated by circulating fungal  virulence factors or host mediators other than TNF-alpha, a cytokine considered  essen

AB  - BACKGROUND: Both the 21-aminosteroid U74006F, a potent inhibitor of lipid peroxidation, and L644-711, an anion channel blocker that inhibits both  neutrophil and astrocyte function, have been previously shown to reduce brain  injury in pretreatment paradigms of cerebral ischemia. It was therefore of  interest to examine the effect of these agents in combination, when given on a  delayed basis as adjuvants to thrombolytic therapy in a rabbit model of  thromboembolic stroke. METHODS: Animals were mechanically ventilated and arterial  blood gases controlled. Core and brain temperature, intracranial pressure, and  mean arterial pressure were continuously monitored. Regional cerebral blood flow  and hematocrit were measured hourly. Blood samples were taken to measure  neutrophil (aggregation and chemiluminescence) and platelet (aggregation)  activity. Following delivery of an autologous clot via the carotid artery, all  experiments were continued for an 8-hour period. U74006F (3 mg/kg I.V.) and  L644,711 (12 mg/kg I.V.) or their vehicle control (n = 8, each group) were given  3.5 hours following autologous clot embolization. Both groups received  tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) (6.3 mg/kg I.V.), beginning 4 hours  following thromboembolic stroke and continuing over a 2-hour infusion period.  Infarct size was determined following staining and image analysis. RESULTS: In  the L644,711/U74006F group, neutrophil chemiluminescence was reduced following  drug therapy; however, there were no significant differences between groups  regarding infarct size (50.3 +/- 8.7 vs. 49.9 +/- 10.6, treatment vs. t-PA  control, mean +/- SEM), or in regional cerebral blood flow or intracranial  pressure over time. CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that prolonged (3.5 hours) delay  of the initiation of therapy with the anion channel blocker L644,711 and the  21-aminosteroid U74006F fails to further reduce brain injury when given in  combination with tissue plasminogen activator in a rabbit model of thromboembolic  stroke.

AB  - Certain tissues are known to be susceptible to shock-induced damage: liver, small bowel mucosa, and small bowel wall. This study was done to assess the changes in  adenine nucleotides induced by hemorrhagic shock. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n =  21; 300-350 g) were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, ip) and  mechanically ventilated. The external jugular vein and common carotid artery were  cannulated. Laparotomy was done. Hemorrhagic shock was induced by withdrawing  blood into a heparinized syringe until a mean arterial blood pressure of 40 mm Hg  was obtained and was maintained for 30 min by continued withdrawals. Shed blood  was then reinfused through the venous catheter. No additional fluid was  administered. The animals were observed for another 60 min. Throughout the  procedure, biopsies were taken of liver and small bowel. The small bowel biopsies  were separated into mucosal and wall fractions. Nucleotides were extracted. ATP,  ADP, AMP, adenosine, inosine, xanthine, and hypoxanthine were measured with  gradient HPLC. Cellular ATP concentrations decreased significantly during shock  (P < 0.05). Liver ATP dropped from 8.93 +/- 0.55 to 2.91 +/- 0.16 micromol/g dry  tissue (mean +/- SEM) (33%), small bowel mucosal ATP from 9.40 +/- 1.04 to 3.26  +/- 0.21 (35%), and small bowel wall ATP from 5.47 +/- 0.36 to 2.74 +/- 0.18  (50%). The nucleotide response to shock in small bowel mucosa was closer to that  of liver than to that of small bowel wall. After reperfusion, ATP levels were  partially restored in liver, small bowel mucosa, and small bowel wall, but not to  preshock values. All of the metabolites (adenosine, inosine, hypoxanthine, and  xanthine) increased during shock (P < 0.05), and did not return to preshock  levels after reperfusion. The abnormalities in ATP and its metabolites, and their  persistence after reperfusion, suggest a possible mechanism for the production of  postshock damage.

T2  - Cardiovascular research
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the effect of ischaemia on vascular responses to endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent  vasodilators and on vasoconstrictor responses. Furthermore, the ability of  preconditioning to prevent ischaemia-induced changes in vascular reactivity was  examined in the rat hindquarters. METHODS: The abdominal aortae of anaesthetized  rats were cannulated for hindquarters perfusion with Krebs bicarbonate solution  containing phenylephrine to induce vasoconstrictor tone. Responses of the  hindquarters to endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent vasodilators  were examined. Hindquarters responses to neuronal release of the vasodilator  acetylcholine (ACh) induced by peri-aortic nerve stimulation were also examined.  RESULTS: Ischaemia with 2 h aortic occlusion prior to Krebs perfusion attenuated  vasodilator responses to the neuronal release of ACh [10 Hz; decrease in  perfusion pressure (delta PP) control: -18(s.e.m. 3) mmHg, Ischaemic: -13(3)  mmHg], exogenous ACh [10 ng; delta PP control: -22(2) mmHg, ischaemic: -17(2)  mmHg] and carbachol [1.0 micrograms; delta PP control: -21(3) mmHg, ischaemic:  -12(3) mmHg]. Responses to other endothelium-dependent vasodilators bradykinin  and histamine or the endothelium-independent vasodilator, sodium nitroprusside,  were not impaired by ischaemia. Similarly vasoconstriction to noradrenaline and  serotonin was not affected. Ischaemia preceded by preconditioning with 5 min  aortic occlusion and 10 min reperfusion prevented impairment of vasodilatation to  nerve stimulation [1.0 micrograms; delta PP preconditioned: -24 (3)  preconditioned: -20(1) mmHg], ACh [10 ng; delta PP preconditioned: -22(1) mmHG]  and carbachol [1.0 micrograms; delta PP preconditioned: -24(3) mmHG]caused by  ischaemia. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that hindquarters ischaemia causes  selective impairment of dilator responses to muscarinic agonists and ischaemic  preconditioning prevents that impairment.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether male sex steroids contribute to the depression in cell-mediated immunity following trauma-hemorrhage and resuscitation. DESIGN: Two  weeks before the induction of soft-tissue trauma (2.5-cm midline laparotomy) and  hemorrhagic shock (mean [+/-SEM] blood pressure, 35 +/- 5 mm Hg), male C3H/HeN  mice were castrated or sham castrated. Following trauma-hemorrhage, the mice were  resuscitated and killed 24 hours thereafter to obtain whole blood and the spleen.  RESULTS: Splenocyte proliferation and splenocyte interleukin-2 and interleukin-3  release were significantly depressed in sham-castrated animals after  trauma-hemorrhage. In contrast, these variables in castrated mice after  trauma-hemorrhage were similar to those in sham-operated animals. Corticosterone  plasma levels were significantly elevated in both trauma-hemorrhage groups  compared with those in sham-operated mice. Plasma testosterone levels were  undetectable in castrated animals and detectable in sham-castrated mice.  CONCLUSIONS: Castration before soft-tissue trauma and hemorrhagic shock maintains  normal immune function in male mice, but sham-castrated male mice show  significant immunodepression. The maintenance of immune function by androgen  deficiency does not seem to be related to changes in the release of  corticosterone. We conclude that male sex steroids are involved in the  immunodepression observed after trauma-hemorrhage. Thus, the use of  testosterone-blocking agents following trauma-hemorrhage should prevent the  depression of immune functions and decrease the susceptibility to sepsis under  those conditions.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We tested the hypothesis that intravenous administration of the potent sigma-receptor ligand 4-phenyl-1-(4-phenylbutyl) piperidine (PPBP)  during transient focal ischemia would decrease postischemic brain infarction  volume in rats. METHODS: Rats underwent intravascular focal ischemia for 2 hours  followed by 22 hours of reperfusion. Halothane anesthesia was used only during  initiation and cessation of ischemia. Rats received saline (n = 10) or 1 mumol/kg  per hour PPBP (n = 10) by continuous intravenous infusion starting 1 hour after  the initiation of ischemia and continuing through 22 hours of reperfusion.  RESULTS: There was no difference between groups in blood pressure, arterial blood  gas values, and body temperature. Triphenyltetrazolium-determined infarction  volume of ipsilateral cerebral cortex (saline, 39 +/- 6%; PPBP, 21 +/- 7% of  ipsilateral hemisphere; mean +/- SEM) and striatum (saline, 68 +/- 6%; PPBP, 33  +/- 8% of ipsilateral striatum) was smaller in rats treated with PPBP than in  rats treated with saline. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that sigma-receptors  may play an important role in the mechanism of injury both in cortex and striatum  after 2 hours of transient focal ischemia in rats. Because PPBP afforded  protection when administered at the end of ischemia and during reperfusion,  sigma-receptors may influence the progression of injury in ischemic border  regions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) requires invasive procedures such as liver biopsy and endoscopic retrograde  cholangiography (ERC). Sonographic measurement of fasting gall bladder volume,  which has been reported to be enlarged in PSC, could serve as a non-invasive  screening test. METHODS: Fasting gall bladder volume was studied in patients with  PSC (n = 24), primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC, n = 13), liver cirrhosis due to  other causes (n = 18), ulcerative colitis (n = 15), and healthy controls (n =  23). Meal induced gall bladder emptying was studied in patients with PSC,  patients with PBC, and healthy controls. RESULTS: In patients with PSC gall  bladder volume was greatly enlarged (72.9 (SEM 3.7) ml) compared with healthy  controls (25.4 (1.7) ml, and patients with PBC (30.9 (2.7) ml), liver cirrhosis  (31.3 (4.0) ml) or ulcerative colitis (25.8 (2.0) ml) (p < 0.0005 v all). In four  patients with PSC the gall bladder wall was irregularly thickened (> 4 mm) as  previously described in PSC. Postprandial residual fractions (% of fasting  volume) were comparable between patients with PSC (17.5 (3.7)%) and those with  PBC (23.6 (7.1%) and healthy controls (12.7 (2.3)%) Although gall bladder  emptying seems normal, increased biliary pressure in patients with PSC cannot be  excluded. CONCLUSION: Apart from wall thickening, patients with PSC often present  with enlargement of the gall bladder. Sonographic determination of fasting gall  bladder volume may be a useful, non-invasive, and easy to perform tool in the  evaluation of patients suspected of having PSC.

AB  - Resuscitation using small volumes (3-5 mL/kg) of 7.5% hypertonic saline (HTS) is effective for hemorrhagic shock. Whether HTS is beneficial for the initial  resuscitation of burn injury is not clear. We compared the hemodynamic effects of  HTS versus lactated Ringer's solution (LR) and examined organ tissue perfusion  during burn resuscitation (R). Full thickness scald burn (35% of total body  surface area) was induced in pentobarbital-anesthetized rats. Regional blood  flows were measured using radioactive microspheres before and 30 min after burn,  and after R with either HTS (4 mL/kg) or LR (at a dose required for equivalent  restoration of arterial blood pressure). Data from the HTS-or LR-resuscitated  groups were compared to those from a nonresuscitated group (n = 10 in each  group). Mean arterial pressure decreased 30% after burn (from 120 +/- 4 to 84 +/-  5 mm Hg, mean +/- SEM) and returned toward baseline (112 +/- 7 mm Hg) at 10 min  after R with HTS (4 mL/kg) or LR (22.6 +/- 0.7 mL/kg), but subsequently decreased  to 100 +/- 7 mm Hg with HTS and 105 +/- 5 mm Hg with LR at 30 min. In contrast to  LR, resuscitation using HTS was associated with tachycardia. Blood flows to the  skin and muscle of the normal or burn regions did not change after fluid  resuscitation as compared to a nonresuscitated group. Fluid resuscitation  transiently increased intestinal perfusion. Similar improvements in blood flow to  the spleen were observed with HTS and LR at 10 min after R (from 128 +/- 10 to  156 +/- 15 and from 113 +/- 10 to 145 +/- 26 mL.min-1 x 100 g-1, respectively).  However, at 30 min after R, splenic perfusion in the LR group was not different  from that in the nonresuscitated group. Blood flows to the brain and kidney  increased 39% and 42%, respectively, with HTS. HTS was also associated with  pronounced improvements in blood flows to the heart (from 346 +/- 20 to 631 +/-  37 mL.min-1 x 100 g-1), liver (from 36 +/- 2 to 62 +/- 4 mL.min-1 x 100 g-1), and  testis (from 29 +/- 2 to 43 +/- 2 mL.min-1 x 100g-1). Resuscitation using HTS was  associated with rapid improvement in organ tissue perfusion in anesthetized rats  subjected to burn injury. In comparison to LR, greater increases in blood flows  to the heart, kidney, liver, and testis were observed with HTS. The results  suggest that significant improvement in blood flow distribution can be achieved  using HTS at less than one fifth the volume of LR for the initial treatment of  burn shock.

AB  - The effect of afterload during regional ischaemia on myocardial stunning was studied in 15 pentobarbital anaesthetized cats. 10 min occlusion of the left  anterior descending artery (LAD) was followed by 60 min of reperfusion. Afterload  was decreased by intravenous infusion of nitroglycerine 3-8 micrograms kg-1 min-1  in group I (n = 8); left ventricular peak systolic pressure (LVSP) 84 +/- 4 mmHg  (mean +/- SEM) during coronary artery occlusion. In group II (n = 7) LVSP was  increased to 188 +/- 10 mmHg by inflating an intraaortic balloon during coronary  artery occlusion. Regional function in the LAD perfused region was evaluated by  cross-oriented sonomicrometry. Myocardial tissue blood flow was evaluated by  radio-labelled microspheres. Afterload alterations did not affect regional  systolic shortening (10.8 +/- 2.0% vs. 11.0 +/- 1.5% in group I and II,  respectively, after 60 min of reperfusion). However, increased end-diastolic  dimensions (diastolic creep) in both the circumferential and longitudinal  segments were markedly more pronounced in the high afterload group (group II).  Also important, the markedly increased myocardial tissue blood flow during  reperfusion in group II as compared with group I (2.30 +/- 0.18 vs. 1.34 +/- 0.08  mL min-1 g-1 and 2.58 +/- 0.23 vs. 1.49 +/- 0.07 mL min-1 g-1 in subepicardial  and subendocardial layers in the LAD perfused region) suggests that increased  diastolic creep increased metabolic demands. This study indicates that passive  stretching of the ischaemic area during coronary artery occlusion is an important  mechanism behind diastolic creep.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether closed bone fracture in conjunction with hemorrhagic shock compromises immune functions more severely than hemorrhagic  shock alone. DESIGN: In a randomized, controlled trial, closed bone fracture of  the right lower leg and/or hemorrhagic shock (mean +/- SEM arterial blood  pressure, 35 +/- 5 mm Hg for 90 minutes) were induced in male C3H/HeN mice  (weight, 25 g). Animals subjected to hemorrhage were resuscitated with the shed  blood and lactated Ringer solution. At 72 hours after the experiment, all animals  were killed to obtain whole blood, splenocytes, and splenic and peritoneal  macrophages. Macrophage interleukin-1 and splenocyte interleukin-2 and  interleukin-3 release were determined by bioassay, and splenocyte proliferation  was measured by tritiated thymidine incorporation. RESULTS: Closed bone fracture  alone did not affect immune functions 72 hours after the trauma. Hemorrhagic  shock, however, induced a significant depression of splenocyte and macrophage  functions. Bone fracture followed by hemorrhagic shock further depressed  splenocyte proliferation and splenocyte interleukin-2 and interleukin-3 release  as well as interleukin-1 release. CONCLUSION: Since bone injury coupled with  hemorrhagic shock produces more severe depression of immune functions than  hemorrhage alone, bone injury appears to play a contributory role in further  depressing immune functions in trauma patients who experience major blood loss.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A non-invasive marker is needed to identify patients with significant gastrointestinal injury due to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.  Gastrointestinal permeability to sucrose has been suggested as such a test. AIMS:  To assess the utility of sucrose permeability as a marker of gastroduodenal  mucosal injury after single and multiple doses of aspirin, to identify the site  of increased sucrose permeability, to explore the relation between sucrose  permeability and endoscopic findings, and to evaluate whether Helicobacter pylori  infection influenced gastroduodenal sucrose permeability. METHODS: After a  fasting urine was obtained, 500 ml of a solution containing 100 g of sucrose was  ingested. Urine was collected for five hours and assayed for sucrose by high  performance liquid chromatography. Sucrose permeability was also assessed 20  minutes after ingestion of 650 mg of aspirin and eight to 12 hours after a 72  hour course of 650 mg aspirin four times a day. The site of increased  permeability was identified after pyloric occlusion with a double balloon tube.  RESULTS: Thirty seven healthy volunteers participated. Sucrose permeability (mean  (SEM)) increased after both single (195.2 (27) mg and multiple (196.4 (31) mg)  doses of aspirin compared with baseline (53.7 (10) mg; p < 0.0005). Balloon  pyloric occlusion confirmed that the site of increased sucrose permeability was  the stomach. The effect of aspirin on sucrose permeability was similar in those  with and without H pylori infection. CONCLUSION: These results confirm the use of  sucrose permeability as a marker of aspirin induced gastroduodenal mucosal injury  and identify the stomach as the major site of increased permeability. H pylori  infection does not seem to change gastric mucosal sucrose permeability either at  baseline or after ingestion of aspirin.

T2  - Scandinavian journal of clinical and laboratory investigation
AB  - A model of cardiac dysfunction induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) was established by adding hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to the perfusate of isolated,  Langendorff-perfused rat hearts, and the mechanism of functional injury was  investigated. The following groups were included: 1 (n = 7), control perfusion; 2  (n = 11), perfusion with H2O2 (180 mumol 1(-1) for 10 min followed by recovery  for 50 min; 3 (n = 4), control perfusion with N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 100 mumol  1(-1); 4 (n = 7), perfusion with H2O2 and NAC; 5 (n = 4), control perfusion with  thiourea (15 mmol 1(-1), 6 (n = 7), H2O2 and thiourea together; 7 (n = 4),  control perfusion with catalase (150 U ml-1); 8 (n = 7), catalase and H2O2, 9 (n  = 4), control perfusion with deferoxamine (5 mmol 1(-1); and 10 (n = 7),  deferoxamine and H2O2. coronary flow (CF), left ventricular developed pressure  (LVDP), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), and heart rate (HR) were  measured. All values are mean +/- SEM. When given alone, catalase, thiourea, NAC  and deferoxamine did not influence left ventricular pressures, but NAC, catalase  and thiourea increased CF. H2O2 increased CF (maximum 146 +/- 6% of baseline  value after 5 min, p < 0.001 compared to group 1), decreased LVDP (minimum 14 +/-  5% of baseline value after 10 min, p < 0.0004), and increased LVEDP (from 0 mmHg  to a maximum of 54 +/- 7 mmHg after 5 min recovery, p < 0.0003). All these  changes gradually reversed during recovery. Catalase and thiourea both inhibited  the H2O2-induced effects, but catalase inhibition was more complete. Neither NAC  nor deferoxamine had any effect on H2O2-induced cardiac dysfunction. In  conclusion, H2O2 perfusion is a convenient and reversible model of ROS-induced  functional injury to isolated rat hearts. H2O2, rather than the hydroxyl radical,  seems to be the main injurious ROS in this model.

AB  - The mouse has become the animal of choice for genetic manipulations resulting in altered myocardial function, but assessment of cardiac function is extremely  difficult due to the animal's size. This study was designed to establish a  work-performing isolated mouse heart preparation to objectively investigate  myocardial performance in murine hearts. Isolated work-performing cardiac  functional studies were performed on a modified Langendorff apparatus using 15  mice [25 to 28 g, +/-0.4 (SEM)]. The hearts were instrumented with a transonic  flow meter and micromanometers to measure on-line aortic flow (AF), aortic  pressure, and left atrial pressure (preload). A VAX cardiac function analyzing  system was used to determine cardiac parameters including heart rate,  contractility (max dP/dt), stroke volume (SV), and stroke work (SW) at various  preload levels compared to a baseline preload of 5 mm Hg before and after 7 min  of warm ischemia. AF increased from 1.01 ml/min (+/- 0.26) at 5 mm Hg of preload  to 4.15 ml/min (+/- 1.03, P < 0.05) at 20 mm Hg of preload and decreased to 3.64  ml/min (+/- 0.62) at 25 mm Hg. SV, dP/dt, and SW increased with higher preload  levels. There was a significant decrease in cardiac function postischemia.  CONCLUSIONS: A valid isolated work-performing preload-dependent murine heart  preparation involving minimal instrumentation of the heart is established to  measure cardiac function and myocardial performance. Significant  ischemia-reperfusion injury occurred after 7 min of ischemia. This model is a  reliable and objective tool by which to evaluate murine cardiac function and to  study ischemia-reperfusion injury.

AB  - Despite improved preservation methods, graft dysfunction after liver transplantation continues to contribute considerably to postoperative morbidity  and mortality. In clinical and experimental studies prostaglandin (PG)I2 analogs  proved effective in the treatment of liver damage of different origin. Using in  vivo fluorescence microscopy in a rat liver transplantation model, we studied the  effect of donor bolus pretreatment with the PGI2 analog epoprostenol on hepatic  graft revascularization. After epoprostenol bolus pretreatment (group 1: liver  transplantation/PGI2), perfusion of liver sinusoids after reperfusion was  significantly improved as compared with untreated donor livers (group 2: liver  transplantation (95.2+/-0.6% vs. 75.3+/-3.8%, mean +/- SEM; P=0.001) and  epoprostenol was found almost in the range of that in normal nontransplanted  livers (99.4+/-0.2%). In addition, leukocyte adherence in liver lobules  (21.0+/-3.5 vs. 115+/-11.5 n/lobule; P=0.001) and postsinusoidal venules  (23.0+/-3.8 vs. 113+/-11.3 n/mm2 endothelial surface; P=0.002) was significantly  reduced in the pretreated grafts. Bile production in the recipient was  significantly increased by epoprostenol pretreatment of the donor (1.88+/-0.4 vs.  0.63+/-0.13 g/100 g liver*1 hr; P=0.015), indicating restored liver function.  These results suggest that the prostacyclin analog epoprostenol is effective in  preconditioning the graft prior to transplantation, i.e., improving preservation  and increasing graft resistance to ischemia/reperfusion injury. Thus, favorable  effects on early graft function after clinical liver transplantation may be  achieved by introducing epoprostenol pretreatment into the harvesting procedure.

T2  - British journal of anaesthesia
AB  - Several studies have reported a protective effect of halothane on myocardial injury in an ischaemia-reperfusion situation. It is unclear if the protection is  a result of the haemodynamic effects of halothane or if halothane has a specific  action on ischaemia or reperfusion pathomechanisms. To examine this question, we  have used an isolated rat heart model where heart rate (300 beat min-1),  ventricular volume and coronary flow are constant. Left ventricular developed  pressure (LVDP) and release of creatine kinase (CK) were measured as variables of  myocardial performance and cellular injury, respectively. Five control hearts  were subjected to 35 min of low-flow (2 ml min-1) anoxic and substrate-free  perfusion and were then perfused for 1 h with the oxygenated buffer. In the  treatment groups, halothane 0.4 mmol litre-1 was added during the first 30 min of  anoxic perfusion (n = 5) or during the first 30 min of reoxygenation (n = 5). In  five additional hearts, the effect of halothane 0.4 mmol litre-1 was tested under  normoxic conditions. Mean basal CK release was 0.29 (SEM 0.13) iu g-1 min-1 and  LVDP was 105.5 (4.0) mm Hg. Under normoxic conditions, halothane reduced LVDP to  52.0 (2.6) mm Hg. In control hearts, the major cell injury occurred at the onset  of reoxygenation (CK release increased to 149.1 (9.1) iu g-1 min-1) and  functional recovery after 1 h of reoxygenation was poor (control LVDP, 14.2(2.)%  of baseline). Halothane during anoxia attenuated myocardial injury only  moderately (CK release 50.2(5.7) iu g-1 min-1) and LVDP recovered to 30.8(3.0)%  (each P < 0.05 vs control). When halothane was administered at reoxygenation, CK  release was reduced to 10.1 (0.9) iu g-1 min-1 and LVDP recovered to 69.4(4.9)%  (each P < .05 vs control). We conclude that halothane not only attenuated  ischaemic injury but had a specific protective action against reoxygenation  injury.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Both esophagectomy and pulmonary resection are associated with postoperative cardiac complications, partly because of autonomic perturbations  involving the heart. This study was undertaken to determine whether heart rate  variability (HRV), employed as an index of cardiac autonomic function, changes in  patients undergoing esophagectomy or pulmonary resection. METHODS:  Electrocardiographic RR intervals were measured in 20 esophagectomized patients,  10 undergoing right and 10 undergoing left pulmonary resection on the  preoperative day as baseline data and on postoperative days 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, and  30. Instantaneous heart rate was calculated every 250 ms from 416-s data of RR  intervals. Power spectra of HRV for 128 s were computed using a fast Fourier  transform and normalized by squared mean heart rate. The average ten sets of  normalized HRV power were obtained by integrating the following power spectral  bands: the low-, (0.06-0.10 Hz), high- (0.15-0.40 Hz), and total-frequency  regions (0.01-0.40 Hz). RESULTS: In the esophagectomy group, mean low-, high-,  and total-frequency HRV power decreased after surgery to 17%, 6%, and 15% of  their preoperative values, respectively, and these indexes remained suppressed  for up to 30 days. After right pulmonary resection, low- and total-frequency HRV  power decreased through 30 and 7 postoperative days, respectively. In the left  pulmonary resection group, HRV remained unchanged. In the esophagectomy group,  mean (+/- SEM) heart rate increased from 78 (+/- 3) bpm to more than 90 bpm  throughout the study, and body temperature from 36.5 (+/- 0.1) degrees C to more  than 37.0 degrees C through 14 postoperative days. Heart rate and body  temperature remained increased for 3 days after pulmonary surgery. Mean arterial  pressure remained unchanged in the three surgical groups. CONCLUSIONS: Reductions  indicate HRV after esophagectomy or right pulmonary resection indicate a  substantial and prolonged surgical injury to the autonomic nervous control of  pulse rate.

AB  - Neutrophil activation and accumulation as a consequence of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion has been suggested to exacerbate tissue injury. The current  study is designed to examine the effect of IB4, a monoclonal antibody directed  against the neutrophil adhesion protein, CD18, in a rabbit model of  thromboembolic stroke. New Zealand rabbits (3-3.5 kg n=8 each group), were given  an autologous clot embolus, delivered to the anterior circulation of the brain  via the internal carotid artery. Immediately following thromboembolism, the mean  arterial pressure in all animals was reduced to 30 mmHg by controlled  exsanguination for a period of 45 min. All animals were mechanically ventilated  and following parameters were monitored hourly: arterial blood gases,  intracranial pressure, regional cerebral blood flow, hematocrit, and core  temperature. Rabbits were given either IB4 (1 mg kg(-1)), or vehicle (1 percent  albumin, IV) 30 min following the thromboembolic event. The mean arterial  pressure of all animals was restored to the baseline value of 50-60 mmHg for the  remainder of the 4-h experiment. Following the thromboembolic event, the  intracranial pressure rose in both groups, although this was significantly less  in the IB4-treated group, with the final values being 195.9 +/- 38.3 vs. 135.5  +/- 26.0 percent of baseline (mean +/- SEM, p < 0.05). However, regional cerebral  blood flow and infarct size (TTC staining) were virtually identical in both  groups. It is concluded that blockade of the neutrophil adhesion protein, CD18,  may contribute to a reduction in the intracranial pressure following cerebral  ischemia and reperfusion, providing further evidence that activated neutrophils  may contribute to cerebral edema.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study compared the effect of a nitric oxide donor on limiting the size of infarct resulting from myocardial ischemia-reperfusion between  atherosclerotic and nonatherosclerotic models. BACKGROUND: Endothelial-derived  relaxation in coronary arteries affected by ischemia is substantially impaired  after reperfusion, and this impairment may exacerbate the myocardial  ischemia-reperfusion injury. In animals with experimental atherosclerosis,  release of endothelial-derived relaxing factor is also decreased, and the  propagation of myocardial infarction could be exacerbated. METHODS: We examined  the extent of myocardial injury induced by ischemia (30 min) and reperfusion (48  hr) in rabbits fed a cholesterol-rich (1%) or normal diet for 10 weeks. We also  evaluated the effect of a nitric oxide donor (S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine  [SNAP], a nitric oxide precursor (L-arginine) or a degradation product of SNAP  (N-acetylpenicillamine) on infarct size in these models. RESULTS: Severity of  myocardial injury was significantly exacerbated in cholesterol-fed rabbits (75.2  +/- 4.4% [mean +/- SEM]) compared with that in non-cholesterol-fed rabbits (53.2  +/- 5.2%). This exacerbation was prevented by treatment with SNAP (50.2 +/- 6.4%)  but not with L-arginine (70.5 +/- 6.0%) or N-acetylpenicillamine (70.4 +/- 4.8%)  in cholesterol-fed-rabbits. However, SNAP did not limit infarct size in  non-cholesterol-fed rabbits (60.8 +/- 4.2%). The rate-pressure product was  similar during the course of the experiment in all the groups. CONCLUSIONS:  Myocardial damage induced by ischemia-reperfusion was significantly exacerbated  in rabbits fed a long-term cholesterol-rich diet but was effectively reversed by  treatment with a nitric oxide donor. However, this agent did not limit infarct  size in normal rabbits. Thus, a nitric oxide donor reduces myocardial infarct  size in atherosclerotic but not in nonatherosclerotic rabbits.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the protective effect of a new endotoxin analogue, monophosphoryl lipid A (MLA) in a rabbit model of myocardial  ischemia/reperfusion and to show if this protection was mediated via synthesis of  70 kDa heat shock protein (HSP 70). Three groups of New Zealand White rabbits  underwent 30 min coronary occlusion, followed by 4 hours reperfusion. First group  of rabbits (n = 6) were treated with 0.35 ml vehicle (40 % propylene glycol, 10 %  ethanol in water). The second and third group of rabbits (n = 6-8) were treated  with MLA (35 micrograms/kg, i.v.) 12 and 24 hours prior to ischemia and  reperfusion. MLA treatment either 12 or 24 h prior to ischemia/reperfusion  demonstrated significantly reduced infarct size (12.5 +/- 1.7 and 14.7 +/- 2.1%  for 12 and 24 h) when compared with vehicle control (40.4 +/- 8.6%, mean +/-  S.E.M, p < 0.05). No significant differences in the infarct size was observed  between the 12 and 24 h MLA treated groups. The area at risk was not  significantly different between the three groups. Baseline values of heart rate,  systolic and diastolic blood pressure were not significantly different between  the control and MLA treated groups. However, the systolic as well as diastolic  blood pressure during reperfusion were significantly lower in rabbits treated  with MLA. Western blot analysis of the protein extracts of the hearts (n =  2/group) demonstrated no increase in the expression of the inducible form of HSP  70 following treatment with MLA. We conclude that MLA has significant  anti-infarct effect in rabbit which is not mediated by the cardioprotective  protein HSP 70. The anti-infarct effect of this drug is superior to the reported  protective effects of delayed ischemic or heat stress preconditioning. We  hypothesize that the pharmacologic preconditioning afforded by MLA is  accomplished via a unique pathway that bypasses the usual intracellular signaling  pathways which lead to the myocardial protection with the expression of heat  shock proteins.

AB  - Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury increases both tissue levels and release of histamine. To study the possible effects of ischemia-reperfusion on histamine  metabolism tissue activities of histidine decarboxylase (HDC), histamine N-methyl  transferase (HNMT) and diamine oxidase (DAO) were investigated in isolated rat  hearts subjected to either 20 min global ischemia and 40 min reperfusion (n = 10)  or control perfusion (n = 8). Histamine in the coronary effluent increased from  21 +/- 4 nmol/min (mean +/- SEM) before ischemia to 55 +/- 5 and 50 +/- 7  nmol/min after 4 and 10 min reperfusion (p < 0.004 and p < 0.004). Tissue HDC  activity did not change during observation in any group. HNMT activity was  unchanged in controls, but increased from 0.37 +/- 0.04 to 0.84 +/- 0.18 and 0.96  +/- 0.22 pmol methylhistamine/mg protein hour after 4 and 10 min reperfusion (p <  0.008 and p < 0.01). DAO decreased similarly in controls and ischemic-reperfused  hearts during observation. In conclusion, the previously observed increase of  tissue histamine during reperfusion cannot be explained by increased histamine  synthesis or decreased histamine catabolism.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Infusion of angiotensin II (AngII) during the third and fourth week after balloon injury of the left common carotid artery of the rat induces smooth  muscle cell (SMC) DNA synthesis. In this study we wanted to investigate whether  alpha 1-adrenoreceptors are involved in AngII-induced SMC DNA synthesis in the  neointima. METHODS: Adult male Wistar Kyoto rats were subcutaneously infused for  2 weeks with AngII and the alpha 1-adrenoreceptor antagonist doxazosin during the  3rd and the 4th week after balloon injury of the left common carotid artery.  Control groups received AngII, 0.9% NaCl, AngII + 50% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO,  the solvent of doxazosin), doxazosin or 50% dimethylsulfoxide. Each rat received  5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine in a separate osmotic minipump to label DNA-synthesizing  SMC. Systolic blood pressures were measured in all groups. RESULTS: Angiotensin  II caused an increase in systolic blood pressure, whereas addition of doxazosin  did not affect the increase in SBP caused by AngII. In the media of the  non-injured carotid artery, AngII increased SMC DNA synthesis, as the BrdUrd  labeling fraction increased from 0.2 +/- 0.1% (mean +/- s.e.m.) in the NaCl group  towards 3.4 +/- 0.6% in the AngII group. Coinfusion with doxazosin reduced the  AngII-induced increase in BrdUrd labeling fraction from 3.2 +/- 0.8% in the AngII  + DMSO group towards 0.6 +/- 0.2% in the AngII+doxazosin group. A similar effect  of doxazosin was found in the media of the injured left carotid artery, in which  coinfusion with doxazosin also reduced the BrdUrd labeling fraction from 2.6 +/-  0.8% in the AngII+DMSO group towards 0.3 +/- 0.1% in the AngII+doxazosin group.  In the neointima of the injured left carotid artery, AngII increased the BrdUrd  labeling fraction from 11.7 +/- 1.6% in the NaCl group towards 28.0 +/- 3.4% in  the AngII group. Coinfusion with doxazosin did not influence the AngII-induced  SMC DNA synthesis, since the BrdUrd labeling fraction in the neointima of the  AngII+doxazosin group was 22.5 +/- 2.9%, whereas the neointimal BrdUrd labeling  fraction in the AngII+DMSO group was 22.9 +/- 2.3%. Little effect was found on  the medial cross-sectional area. The neointimal cross-sectional area was  increased as a result of infusion of AngII (0.12 +/- 0.01 mm2 vs. 0.18 +/- 0.01  mm2), and coinfusion of doxazosin did not reduce the AngII-induced increase in  neointimal cross-sectional area (0.18 +/- 0.03 mm2). CONCLUSIONS: These data  suggest that alpha 1-adrenoreceptors are not involved in AngII-induced neointimal  SMC DNA synthesis and cross-sectional area, but only play a role in the media of  the carotid artery.

AB  - Patients with non ulcer dyspepsia (NUD) and lowered mechano sensitivity thresholds in stomach may have lowered mechano sensitivity thresholds in  oesophagus also. The aim was to check this hypothesis. METHODS: 39 patients with  NUD (11 men and 24 women, mean age 57 years, SEM 3.72, range 17-86) and 20  controls (10 men, 10 women, mean age 49.3 years, SEM 3.72, range 31-66) were  studied. Organis diseases were discarded. Gastric mechano sensitivity was studied  with a latex balloon of low compliance, 8 cm length, connected to a manometer.  Balloon was inflated "in ramp" at 10 ml/sec, and "first sensation", discomfort",  and "pain" were registered. At 900 ml inflation was stopped if pain was not  evoked. Oesophageal mechano sensitivity was studied with another latex balloon of  low compliance which, after inflated with 15 ml. of air, was 3.5 cm. in diameter.  Esophageal balloon was inflated "in ramp" (1 ml/sec) up 15 ml. and deflated in 2  cm step from 36 to 22 cm from SDA. Inflation was stopped when symptoms (pain or  discomfort were evoked. Oesophageal acid perfusion test was performed. RESULTS:  83.4% of controls completed up 700 ml. of gastric distension vs. 35.9% of  patients with NUD (p > 0.001). No significative differences in intra-balloon  pressure slope were observed between both groups. 79.2% of NUD patients had chest  pain with oesophageal ballon distension = < 7 ml. vs. 5% in controls (p > 0.001).  Mean volumes were 7.03 ml. (NUD) and 11.9% (controls) (p = 0.001), 63% of  dyspeptic patients with lowered gastric sensitivity thresholds (< 700 ml) had  oesophagic symptoms with inflation volumes = < 7 ml. There was a positive  correlation in stomach and oesophageal mechano sensitivities variations (r =  0.75, +/- 0.58, p > 0.01). When analyzed with that results, oesophageal acid  perfusion test showed 38.5% of "mixed sensitivities" (both mechano- and chemo-),  30.7% of "mechano sensorials" (negative acid test, positive balloon test), and  10.3% of :chemo sensorials" (positive acid test only). In 20.5% both tests were  normal at the moment they were done. These results agreed with our previous  experiences in oesophagus. CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that a significative  proportion of NUD patients had lowered thresholds for mechano stimulation of  stomach and oesophagus at the time that both tests were done. Such alterations  support the hypothesis that a more general mechano-sensitivity alteration is  present in patients with NUD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Initial warm cardioplegic reperfusion is widely used to ameliorate cardiac reperfusion damage after cardioplegic arrest. However, undesired effects  of the high potassium concentration of the cardioplegic perfusate may limit the  beneficial effect of this treatment. Contraction uncoupling by a negative  inotropic and vasodilating agent such as 2,3-butanedione monoxime (BDM) may be  superior to warm cardioplegic reperfusion in reducing reperfusion damage. Thus,  initial reperfusion with BDM was compared with hyperkalemic reperfusion (HKR)  after global ischemia of Langendorff-perfused guinea pig hearts. METHODS: Cardiac  arrest was induced in 16 hearts using hyperkalemic Krebs' solution and hearts  were stored unperfused at 37 degrees C for 40 min. Two groups were studied: HKR,  initial reperfusion with 37 degrees C oxygenated hyperkalemic Krebs' for 5 min,  and BDM, addition of 20 mM BDM to normokalemic Krebs' for 5 min. RESULTS: BDM  increased reactive coronary reflow (128 +/- 8%; all data mean +/- SEM of  baseline) much more than HKR treatment (65 +/- 5%). O2 consumption was reduced  more by HKR (28 +/- 1%) than by BDM (42 +/- 4%), but the O2 supply/consumption  ratio was higher with BDM. During perfusion with normal Krebs' solution, flow  stabilized at about 75% of baseline in both groups. Post-ischemic responses to  adenosine, serotonin, and nitroprusside were depressed to a similar degree in  both two groups. Recovery of left ventricular developed pressure was better in  BDM (69 +/- 2%) than in HKR (61 +/- 3%)-treated hearts. Reperfusion dysrhythmias  were markedly reduced after BDM reperfusion. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate  that treatment in the initial 5-min reperfusion period with BDM is more effective  than hyperkalemic reperfusion in reducing reperfusion damage.

AB  - H290/51, an indenoindole derivative, is a novel low-molecular weight (287.8) inhibitor of lipid peroxidation. Its effect on cardiac injury induced by  exogenous reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) was investigated. ROI were  generated by adding H2O2 (180 mu M) to the perfusate of isolated rat hearts  (Langendorff model, n = 9) for 10 min. H2O2 reduced left ventricular developed  pressure (LVDP = left ventricular systolic pressure -- left ventricular  end-diastolic pressure) from 90 +/- 6 to a minimum of 25 +/- 2 mmHg (mean +/-  SEM) after 10 min (p < 0.001), elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure  (LVEDP) from 0 to 32 +/- 7 mmHg after 20 min (p < 0.0001), and increased coronary  flow (CF). Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release in the coronary effluent and  thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) in cardiac tissue increased  (TBARS from 0.6 +/- 0.04 to 3.1 +/- 0.4 nmol/g tissue after 10 min of H2O2  administration, p < 0.001). Addition of H290/51 (1 mu M, n = 12) from the start  of H2O2 exposure, attenuated the H2O2-induced increase of LVEDP (9 +/- 3 mmHg at  20 min, p < 0.006) and reduced the release of LDH (p < 0.02 at 30 min). LVDP was  not significantly influenced. The increase of TBARS was abolished by H290/51 (p <  0.001). In conclusion, H290/51 inhibited lipid peroxidation, and attenuated  functional and biochemical injury induced by H2O2 exposure.

AB  - The contraction/relaxation responses of thoracic aortal rings clamped with two clamping pressures to potassium chloride (KC1), noradrenaline and carbachol were  studied using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) to ascertain endothelial  lacerations. Clamp A had the tip pressure PA = 0.60 N/mm2 and clamp B PB = 5.16  N/mm2. In 15 Wistar albino rats, weighing 328 +/- 19 g (mean +/- SD), the  thoracic aorta was occluded for 15 min and then three vascular rings (2 mm wide)  were excised. The proximal unclamped ring served as a control. The aorta diameter  was calculated from the circumference of distal rings 1.61 +/- 0.01 mm (n = 15,  dmin = 1.51 mm, dmax = 1.70 mm). The rings were challenged with cumulative  additions of KC1 (10-80 mmol/l) to measure the contraction. Then cumulative  relaxation on the administration of carbachol (0.01-100 mumol/l) as a response to  noradrenaline precontraction (0.1 mumol/l) was determined. A significant loss (P  < 0.05) of vascular relaxation in all clamped rings (clamped with PA and PB  clamping pressures) was seen. No significant differences (P > 0.05) were observed  for contraction between clamped and control rings clamped with clamp A, however  the rings clamped with clamp B showed significantly reduction of contraction (P <  0.05). No significant differences were seen from control rings between groups A  and B (P > 0.05), as well as from clamped rings between groups A and B (P > 0.05)  for both the contraction and relaxation parts of the experiments. With SEM, great  endothelial lacerations with complete disruption of the endothelial layer in the  rings clamped with the clamp B were seen, but no disruption in rings clamped with  clamp A. Therefore endothelial vascular layers are much more susceptible to  pressure injuries than was previously believed. The clamped vessel wall injuries,  particularly in endothelial layers, depend on the momentary peak clamping  pressure (MPCP) as well as on the lower stationary clamping pressure (SCP).

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Coronary venous retroinfusion (CVR) has been used experimentally in large animals for selective drug delivery into ischaemic myocardium. It would be  an advantage if CVR could also be used in isolated perfused rat heart models. The  aim of the present paper is to develop a regional ischaemic model in the isolated  perfused rat heart combined with CVR. METHOD: Pharmacokinetic study: The spatial  distribution of retrogradely infused felodipine (used as a tracer) during  regional myocardial ischaemia was investigated. Following occlusion of the left  coronary artery, felodipine was administered over a period of 5 min by CVR.  Ischaemia-reperfusion study: Following 30 min of stabilisation, 14 rat hearts  were subjected to 60 min of regional ischaemia followed by 60 min of reperfusion.  Felodipine (0.7 nmol/kg, n = 7) or vehicle (n = 7) was administered by means of  CVR. The infusion was given during the last 5 min of ischaemia at a rate of 0.6  ml/min. RESULTS: Pharmacokinetic study: By means of CVR, the compound was  distributed specifically into the ischaemic myocardium. The highest tissue  concentration was obtained when the coronary vein was occluded during CVR. The  maximal concentration in the ischaemic myocardium was 20-70 times that in the  non-ischaemic areas. A transmyocardial gradient was noted with higher drug  concentration in the subepicardial zone. Ischaemia-reperfusion study: At the end  of reperfusion, the recovery of coronary flow, left ventricular developed  pressure and double product (DP; LVDP x HR) was 101 +/- 7% (mean +/- s.e.m.), 99  +/- 8% and 98 +/- 4% of the pre-ischaemic values, respectively. This was  significantly different from the vehicle group (78 +/- 5, P < 0.05, 74+/- 6, P <  0.01 and 78 +/- 3, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: CVR could easily be accomplished in the  isolated perfused rat heart. The drug was specifically delivered into the  ischaemic myocardium. Felodipine exerted a myocardioprotective effect in isolated  rat hearts subjected to 60 min of regional ischaemia followed by 60 min of  reperfusion.

TI  - The effect of exogenous adenosine on functional injury caused by hydrogen peroxide in the isolated rat heart.
AU  - Valen, G.

AB  - Adenosine is an endogenous cardioprotective substance. The present study examines whether exogenous adenosine attenuates cardiac injury induced by oxidative  stress. Rat hearts (Langendorff model) were perfused with H2O2 (180 microM) for  10 min, then recovered for 60 min (n = 10). In other groups adenosine 55 microM,  11 0 microM, or 220 microM (n = 10 in each) was given in addition to H2O2  throughout perfusion. Control perfusion with Krebs Henseleit only (n = 7),  adenosine 110 microM throughout perfusion (n = 7), and adenosine 110 microM as an  intervention (n = 7) was performed. The hearts were paced at 320 beats/min. Left  ventricular systolic (LVSP) and end-diastolic (LVEDP) pressures were measured  together with coronary flow (CF), and left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP =  LVSP - LVEDP) was calculated. H2O2 decreased LVSP from 105 +/- 8 to 60 +/- 5 mmHg  (mean +/- SEM) after 10 min infusion (p < 0.008). Adenosine did not attenuate the  decrease of LVSP. LVEDP increased from 0 to 59 +/- 10 mmHg (p < 0.004) and 62 +/-  11 mmHg 5 and 15 min after end of infusion of H2O2, respectively. Neither 55  microM nor 220 microM adenosine inhibited the H2O2-induced increase of LVEDP.  Adenosine 110 microM attenuated the increase after 15 (15 +/- 4 mmHg, p < 0.004)  and 25 min observation (26 +/- 7 mmHg, p < 0.012). Adenosine did not attenuate  the reduction of LVDP. CF initially increased during infusion of H2O2, thereafter  decreased. Hearts given adenosine had higher basal CF, and CF did not increase  after H2O2. Control perfusion with adenosine, given throughout perfusion or as an  intervention, increased CF and tended to increase LVSP. In summary, adenosine did  not inhibit H2O2-induced depression of contractility or reduction of CF. One  concentration of adenosine (110 microM) attenuated H2O2-induced impairment of  relaxation. Exogenous adenosine does not have an important influence on  functional injury caused by exogenous oxidants.

AB  - A convenient method for the determination of reduced glutathione (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) in human plasma by high-performance liquid  chromatography with fluorescence detection is reported. This assay involves  direct addition of human plasma to methanolic monobromobimane, for simultaneous  protein precipitation and thiol derivatization. The assay was validated by  addition of authentic GSH and GSSG to plasma samples. Plasma glutathione levels  in Chinese male and female volunteers were found to decrease with increasing age  (age groups 20-30, 30-40, 40-50, 50-60, and > 60; mean +/- S.E.M. 0.95 +/- 0.03,  0.77 +/- 0.02, 0.67 +/- 0.03, 0.51 +/- 0.02, 0.48 +/- 0.02 microM for male  volunteers and 1.11 +/- 0.06, 0.76 +/- 0.03, 0.61 +/- 0.03, 0.53 +/- 0.04 and  0.43 +/- 0.04 microM for female volunteers). GSSG levels, in both males and  females, did not show a correlation with age. There were no significant  differences in GSH or GSSG levels among male and female volunteers of the same  age group. These results suggest that elderly persons might be more susceptible  to oxidative injury due to decreased plasma glutathione levels.

AB  - Therapies to lower intracranial pressure (ICP) after traumatic brain injury (TBI) include hyperventilation (HV), intravenous mannitol (IM), and cerebrospinal fluid  drainage from a ventriculostomy (DV). To determine the effects of these therapies  on cerebral blood flow (CBF), fiberoptic oximetry was used to measure jugular  venous O2 saturation (SjvO2) as an index of the CBF to cerebral metabolic rate  for O2 (CMRO2) ratio after IM (25 g IV for more than 5 min), DV (3 min), or HV  (increase respiratory rate by 4) therapy for elevated ICP. Assuming CMRO2 is  constant, changes in SjvO2 reflect changes in CBF. Continuous measurements of  SjvO2, ICP, blood pressure, arterial O2 saturation, and end-tidal CO2 were  obtained in 22 patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 5.3 +/- 0.4 (mean +/-  SD) in the first 5 days after TBI. Therapy was initiated a total of 196 times  when ICP was > 15 mm Hg for > 5 minutes, and measurements made at 20 minutes  after treatment were compared with those made just before. After DV, ICP fell in  90% of the observations by 8.6 +/- 0.7 mm Hg (mean +/- SEM, n = 119); after IM,  ICP fell in 90% of the observations by 7.4 +/- 0.7 mm Hg (n = 43); and after HV,  ICP fell in 88% of the observations by 6.3 +/- 1.2 mm Hg (n = 14). In patients  where ICP fell, SjvO2 increased by 2.49 +/- 0.7% saturation (from 68.0 +/- 1.3%)  with IM, but only by 0.39 +/- 0.4% saturation (from 67.2 +/- 0.9%) with  DV.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of pentoxifylline posttreatment on hemodynamic variables and acute pulmonary injury in the rat intestinal ischemia-reperfusion  (I-R) model, using a recently developed method of fluorescent intravital  pulmonary videomicroscopy. DESIGN: Anesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats were  cannulated for measurement of mean arterial pressure, heart rate, cardiac output,  arterial blood gas values, and hematocrit. Rats underwent isolation of the  superior mesenteric artery for intestinal I-R (45 minutes of ischemia, 120  minutes of reperfusion) and right lateral thoracotomy for pulmonary  videomicroscopy. Epi-illumination fluorescent videomicroscopy was used to  quantitate leakage of intravascular fluorescently labeled albumin into alveoli,  while hemodynamic variables were simultaneously recorded. In the treatment  groups, pentoxifylline was administered after 30 minutes of intestinal ischemia.  Data (mean +/- SEM) were recorded before and during intestinal ischemia and after  reperfusion at 30-minute intervals. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The appearance of  fluorescently labeled albumin into alveolar airspaces was quantitated off-line by  computer and reported as the alveolar leak index. RESULTS: Intestinal I-R caused  alveolar macromolecular leakage, marked by a 300% +/- 48% increase from baseline  (P < .05) in the alveolar leak index. Intestinal I-R also produced systemic  hemodynamic instability demonstrated by a decrease in the mean arterial blood  pressure (-36% +/- 5% vs baseline, P < .05) and cardiac output (-42% +/- 6% vs  baseline, P < .05), metabolic acidosis (final arterial pH of 7.17, P < .05 vs  initial pH), and a 2.3-fold increase in the intravenous fluid requirement when  compared with that in sham animals (P < .05). Treatment with pentoxifylline 30  minutes after intestinal ischemia attenuated pulmonary macromolecular leakage (P  < .05 vs nontreated I-R) and reduced the decrease in cardiac output (-15% +/- 7%  vs baseline, not statistically significant). Pentoxifylline treatment had no  effect on the mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, metabolic acidosis, or  intravenous fluid requirement. CONCLUSIONS: Pentoxifylline reduces alveolar  capillary membrane injury and subsequent protein leakage and improves cardiac  output when administered after 30 minutes of intestinal ischemia. These data  suggest that pentoxifylline may be a possible candidate as a future therapy for  acute pulmonary dysfunction. Further studies in human patients are necessary.

TI  - Hyperbaric oxygen after global cerebral ischemia in rabbits reduces brain vascular permeability and blood flow.
AU  - Mink, R. B.
AU  - Dutka, A. J.
T2  - Stroke
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) has been advocated as a therapy to improve neurological recovery after ischemia, since HBO may improve tissue  oxygen delivery. We examined the effect of HBO treatment after global cerebral  ischemia on early brain injury. METHODS: Rabbits were subjected to 10 minutes of  global cerebral ischemia by cerebrospinal fluid compression. After 30 minutes of  reperfusion, rabbits either were subjected to HBO for 125 minutes and then  breathed 100% O2 at ambient pressure for 90 minutes or breathed 100% O2 for 215  minutes. At the end of reperfusion and 90 minutes after exposure, brain vascular  permeability and cerebral blood flow were measured. Somatosensory evoked  potentials were monitored throughout the experiment. RESULTS: HBO treatment  reduced (P < .05) brain vascular permeability by 16% in gray matter and by 20% in  white matter. Cerebral blood flow was lower (P < .05) in the HBO group (40.9 +/-  1.9 mL/min per 100 g, mean +/- SEM) compared with controls (50.8 +/- 2.0 mL/min  per 100 g). Somatosensory evoked potential recovery was similar in the two groups  (P > .05). CONCLUSIONS: HBO administered after global cerebral ischemia promoted  blood-brain barrier integrity. HBO treatment also reduced cerebral blood flow;  this effect was not associated with a reduction in evoked potential recovery.  Since neurological outcome after global cerebral ischemia is generally poor and  treatment options are limited, HBO should be further investigated as a potential  therapy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of alterations of nitric oxide (NO) and prostacyclin (PGI2) availability on platelet-mediated electrophysiological  effects during myocardial ischaemia. METHODS: Transmembrane action potentials and  electrograms were recorded from isolated, Langendorff-perfused guinea-pig hearts  during normal perfusion, global myocardial ischaemia and reperfusion during  infusion of washed human platelets. Experiments were performed in the presence of  100 microM NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), 30 microM L-arginine, 10  microM haemoglobin, 100 microM sodium nitroprusside and 2.3 nM iloprost, or using  hearts obtained from DL-lysine monoacetylsalicylate (Aspisol, 50 mg.kg-1  i.p.)-treated animals. RESULTS: Perfusion with L-NAME and haemoglobin increased  perfusion pressure by 33% (P = 0.0017) and 23% (P = 0.0026) while sodium  nitroprusside and iloprost reduced it (17%, P = 0.0004, and 24%, P = 0.0006). In  the absence of platelets, these compounds had no effect on arrhythmogenesis, but  in the presence of platelets L-NAME reduced the onset time of ventricular  tachycardia during ischaemia from 19.4 (s.e.m. 2.0) min to 12.9 (2.1) min, P =  0.04 and accentuated the ischaemia-induced reduction of action potential duration  at 95% repolarization (APD95): 95(6) vs. 115(5) ms, P < 0.05 at 25 min. Sodium  nitroprusside in the presence of platelets attenuated the ischaemia-induced  reduction in APD95, while iloprost in the presence of platelets was  antiarrhythmic (ventricular fibrillation 25 vs. 75%, P = 0.04) and attenuated the  reduction in APD95 during ischaemia 115(4) vs. 94(4) ms, P < 0.05 at 20 min.  Infusion of platelets into hearts obtained from  DL-lysine-monoacetylsalicylate-treated guinea-pigs accentuated the  ischaemia-induced reduction in APD95 (94(4) vs. 119(7) ms, P < 0.05 at 20 min)  and this was reversed by sodium nitroprusside (117(7) ms, P < 0.05 at 20 min).  L-NAME and haemoglobin had no effect on the aggregatory responses of the  platelets to 5 microM ADP and 4 micrograms.ml-1 collagen, while sodium  nitroprusside and iloprost ablated the responses to ADP and reduced the responses  to collagen (maximum height of the aggregatory response reduced by 75 and 84%,  respectively, both P = 0.03.) CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of NO and PGI2 synthesis  exacerbates the reduction in cardiac action potential duration associated with  platelet activation during ischaemia, while provision of exogenous NO and PGI2  attenuates the reduction in cardiac action potential duration. Provision of  exogenous NO and PGI2 (as iloprost) was associated with inhibition of platelet  reactivity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac failure remains an important problem after heart transplantation and may be associated with events that occur during brain death  (BD) before transplantation. In this study, cardiac function is studied after BD,  and biochemical evaluation of myocardial high-energy phosphates and the  beta-adrenergic receptor system is presented. METHODS AND RESULTS: The hearts of  17 mongrel dogs (23 to 31 kg) were instrumented with flow probes,  micromanometers, and ultrasonic dimension transducers to measure ventricular  pressure and volume relationships. In a validated canine BD model, systolic right  and left ventricular (RV/LV) function was analyzed by load-insensitive  measurements during caval occlusion (preload-recruitable stroke work, PRSW). The  beta-adrenergic receptor (BAR) density, adenylate cyclase (AC) activity, and  myocardial ATP and creatine phosphate (CP) were measured before and 6 to 7 hours  after BD. Results are expressed as mean +/- SEM (*P < .05 versus baseline, paired  two-tailed Student's t test). Myocardial function deteriorated significantly from  baseline PRSW (RV, 22 +/- 1 erg x 10(3); LV, 75 +/- 4 erg x 10(3)) by 37 +/- 10%  for the RV (P < .001) and 22 +/- 7% for the LV (P < .001). BAR density increased  from 282 +/- 42 to 568 +/- 173 fmol/mg for the RV and from 291 +/- 64 to 353 +/-  56 fmol/mg for the LV. Isoproterenol-stimulated AC activity was also  significantly enhanced after BD. ATP and CP, however, remained unchanged after BD  compared with baseline values before BD. CONCLUSIONS: BD causes significant  systolic biventricular dysfunction. The loss of ventricular function after BD was  more prominent in the right ventricle and may contribute to early postoperative  RV failure in the recipient. These injuries occurred despite BAR system  upregulation after BD. Global myocardial ischemia is unlikely, since ATP and CP  remained normal before and after BD.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We determined the neuropathologic damage in a canine model of global incomplete ischemia commonly used in a variety of physiological  experiments. METHODS: We induced 20 minutes of incomplete ischemia in dogs (n =  9) by increasing intracranial pressure via intraventricular infusion of  artificial cerebrospinal fluid to maintain a cerebral perfusion pressure of 10 mm  Hg while keeping body temperature at 38 degrees C during and immediately after  ischemia. After a 7-day recovery period, animals were perfusion-fixed for  neuropathology. In hematoxylin and eosin preparations, ischemic neuronal injury  was assessed, neurons were counted, and percentage of cell damage was determined.  RESULTS: No focal neurological deficits or overt seizures were observed during  the 7-day recovery period. In superior temporal gyrus, 49 +/- 11% and 70 +/- 10%  damage (mean +/- SEM) was observed in layer III pyramidal cells in the crown and  sulcus, respectively. All neocortical regions examined showed neuronal damage in  layers III and/or V. In hippocampus, 59 +/- 11% damage of pyramidal neurons  occurred in CA1, with dorsal (septal) hippocampus showing more injury than  ventral (temporal) portions. The caudate nucleus (head) exhibited 27 +/- 7%  neuronal injury. In cerebellar cortex (anterior lobule), 70 +/- 7% damage of  Purkinje cells occurred, but different folia of cerebellum showed varying degrees  of injury. Brain stem and thalamus were minimally affected despite reduced blood  flow. Inflammatory changes (leukocytic infiltration and neuronal incrustations)  were observed, but only when neuronal degeneration was severe. Pancellular  necrosis and infarction did not occur. CONCLUSIONS: This animal model of ischemia  causes reproducible neuronal injury primarily in cortical regions without  pancellular necrosis and infarction. Damage to subcortical areas is less severe  than to cortical areas, despite comparable reductions in regional cerebral blood  flow. Therefore, in the presence of regionally uniform but incomplete cerebral  ischemia, neocortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons and cerebellar cortical  Purkinje cells are more likely than subcortical neurons to degenerate;  alternatively, pyramidal and Purkinje neurons degenerate before neostriatal  neurons in this model. This neuronal degeneration may represent an intrinsic  cellular mechanism without major contribution of cytotoxic pathways associated  with inflammation.

AB  - A study was done to determine whether intra-articular pressure is increased in equine metacarpophalangeal joints with increasing degrees of synovial distention,  and to correlate elastance of the soft tissue forming the dorsal pouch of the  metacarpophalangeal joint to maximal range of motion in flexion. Sixty seven  metacarpophalangeal joints in 36 horses were categorized by palpation and visual  inspection of the palmar pouch into 1 of 4 increasing grades of distention.  Intra-articular pressures were then measured, using 2 pressure transducers  attached to 22 gauge needles, from the dorsal and palmar pouches simultaneously  while horses stood squarely under mild sedation. Intra-articular pressure ranged  from -13 to +78 mm of Hg. Mean (+/- SEM) palmar pouch pressure was subatmospheric  (-2.53 +/- 2.78 mm of Hg) in joints in which the palmar pouch was not discernible  (grade 0), and was markedly increased (+37.13 +/- 2.775 mm of Hg) in joints in  which the palmar pouch was distended laterally beyond the lateral branch of the  suspensory ligament (grade 3). Grade of distention was positively correlated with  intra articular pressure (r = 0.758; P < 0.001). Significant compartmentation (P  < 0.002) was observed between the dorsal and palmar pouches in all horses. In 25  of the aforementioned horses, (42 joints), which were active or retired  Thoroughbred racehorses with variable degree of metacarpophalangeal joint  injury/disease, a third needle was inserted into the dorsal pouch, and 0.5-ml  increments of saline solution were added every 10 seconds to perform a  pressure/volume (elastance) study of the dorsal pouch. The elastance study for  each joint ended when leakage into the palmar pouch was detected by the pressure  transducer placed in that region. A flexed lateral radio graphic view was taken  of each metacarpophalangeal joint in maximal flexion. The maximal angle of  flexion was measured from the radiograph, and this angle was subtracted from 180  degrees to acquire the range of motion in flexion. Range of motion in flexion has  strong negative correlation (r= -0.68; P < 0.0001) with elastance (stiffness) of  the dorsal pouch, and moderate pouches (r= -0.48; P < 0.0001). To adjust for the  possible correlations resulting from repeated measures on limbs within horses, a  normal linear mixed model was used to assess the effect of limb (right vs left),  range of motion in flexion, and volume of saline solution added on the dependent  variable (delta mm of Hg) in the elastance study. There was no significant limb  effect, but a highly significant effect regarding volume of saline solution added  (P < 0.00001) and range of motion in flexion (P < 0.00001). Loss of range of  motion in flexion of this joint is associated with shortening or loss of the  initial low elastance (flat) phase of the elastance profile. Measuring the  elastance of the dorsal pouch or measuring maximal range of motion in flexion  provides an objective measure of the degree of metacarpophalangeal joint  stiffness secondary to joint disease.

AB  - We studied the effects of n-propyl gallate (n-PG) on Langendorff preparations of isolated rat hearts. Perfusion of the hearts with Krebs-Henseleit (KH) solution  containing 20 microM n-PG did not cause a statistically significant change in  either left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP), end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP),  developed pressure (LVDP), or heart rate (HR), indicating that n-PG has little  acute myocardial toxicity. The effects of n-PG on the reperfused and ischemic  myocardium were tested in hearts subjected to 15-min global P4 the ischemic  hearts with KH buffer resulted in the recovery of the LVDP to 66 +/- 7% (mean +/-  SEM, n = 11) and the recovery of the rate-pressure product (RPP) to 65 +/- 7% of  their preischemic values. The LVEDP of the reperfused hearts was 30 +/- 5 mm Hg  as compared with the preischemic LVEDP of 5.2 +/- 0.9 mm Hg. The difference  between the coronary flow rate of the preischemic hearts (15.4 +/- 0.8 ml/min)  and the reperfused hearts (13.9 +/- 0.9 ml/min) was not statistically significant  (p > 0.05). Addition of n-PG, at the time of reperfusion, resulted in with KH  buffer containing 20 microM n-PG had LVEDP of 6.2 +/- 0.4 mm Hg, and both LVDP  and RPP recovered to 92 +/- 4% of the preischemic control.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT  250 WORDS)

AB  - Newborn infants with intractable respiratory failure who require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) experience diffuse pulmonary atelectasis shortly  after initiation of ECMO. Atelectasis is likely due to the primary lung injury  and the reduction of applied inspiratory ventilator pressure when the respirator  settings are changed to the "rest settings." These pathophysiologic changes  result in a decrease in lung compliance and lung volumes. We hypothesized that  improving lung functions observed during ECMO and indicated by an increase in  lung volumes will predict successful weaning from ECMO. Sixteen infants (mean +/-  SEM: gestational age, 40.3 +/- 0.3 weeks; birth weight, 3.5 +/- 0.1 kg) with  meconium aspiration syndrome (n = 13), sepsis (n = 2), and persistent pulmonary  hypertension (n = 1) were studied. We measured passive respiratory system  mechanics and lung volumes initially during full ECMO support (115 +/- 18 h on  ECMO, Study I), and then within 24 h prior to weaning from ECMO (Study II).  Respiratory system compliance (Crs), respiratory system resistance (Rrs),  functional residual capacity (FRC), and tidal volume (VT) were measured. Prior to  Study I lung volumes were too small to be detected. Crs increased between Study I  and Study II (0.41 +/- 0.05 to 0.63 +/- 0.05 mL/cmH2O/kg, P < 0.05), and VT  increased between Study I and Study II (5.6 +/- 0.6 to 10.4 +/- 0.8 mL/kg, P =  0.0005). FRC increased from 3.6 +/- 1.0 to 7.9 +/- 0.9 mL/kg (P = 0.0001). There  was no change in Rrs (88 +/- 8 to 89 +/- 6 cm H2O/L/s, P = 0.9). The combination  of Crs > 0.5 mL/cmH2O/kg and FRC > 5 mL/kg was a better predictor (P = 0.0002) of  readiness to wean from ECMO than either Crs (> 0.5 mL/cmH2O/kg, P = 0.057) or FRC  (> 5 mL/kg, P = 0.007) alone. The combination of FRC and Crs had a sensitivity of  73.3% and specificity of 100% for successful decannulation. We conclude that  repeated measurements of FRC and Crs can assess lung recovery and may assist in  establishing criteria for successful weaning from ECMO.

AB  - Production of oxygen-free radicals has been proposed as one pathophysiologic mechanism for postburn cardiac contractile dysfunction in adults. To examine this  hypothesis in young subjects, we studied the cardiac effects of polyethylene  glycol-superoxide dismutase (PEG-SOD) and PEG-catalase (PEG-CAT), each given as  20 U/g of body weight with fluid resuscitation (Parkland formula), after a  third-degree burn constituting 33% of the total body surface area in young (6- to  7-day old) guinea pigs (group 3, n = 12). Fluid-treated burns without scavenger  therapy (group 2, n = 15) and sham burn controls (group 1, n = 15) were included.  Animals were killed 24 hours postburn, and hearts were studied in vitro  (Langendorff). Compared with sham burn controls, fluid-treated burns (group 2)  had significant cardiac dysfunction as indicated by a lower peak systolic left  ventricular (LV) pressure (LVP: 67 +/- 2 vs. 57 +/- 4 mm Hg, p = 0.01, mean +/-  SEM), maximal rate of LV pressure development (+dP/dt max: 1169 +/- 45 vs. 988  +/- 45 mm Hg/second, p = 0.01), and fall (-dP/dt max: 1109 +/- 45 vs. 919 +/- 49  mm Hg/second, p = 0.01). In addition, LV function curves calculated for group 2  were shifted downward and to the right of those calculated for sham burn controls  in the direction of contractile depression, p = 0.01. PEG-SOD/PEG-CAT treatment  in burns did not significantly improve LVP (60 +/- 5 mm Hg), but scavenger  therapy improved +/-dP/dt max values (1112 +/- 74 and 988 +/- 98 mm Hg/second,  respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - Oxygen-derived free radicals have been implicated in secondary brain injury after head trauma. Although oxygen-free radicals may be derived from multiple sources,  the activation and accumulation of neutrophils in areas of brain injury is a  potential source of deleterious inflammatory mediators, including free radicals,  which may exacerbate the primary insult. Neutrophils may also impede the cerebral  microcirculation by congestion and occlusion of postcapillary venules. The  lazaroid U83836E is a potent-free radical scavenger that inhibits lipid  peroxidation. U83836E was studied in a cryogenic model of cerebral injury in  pretreatment paradigm. Fifteen rabbits received a unilateral cryogenic brain  lesion. Six animals received U83836E, and nine animals received vehicle only.  Arterial blood gases, hematocrit, temperature, and mean arterial pressure were  controlled in physiologic range throughout the experiment. Intracranial pressure  was continuously monitored. Lesion size was determined by triphenyltertrazolium  chloride staining and planimetric image analysis. Neutrophil aggregation and  oxygen-free radical generation was assessed in whole blood by impedance  aggregometry and simultaneous luminol-mediated chemiluminescence, respectively.  Myeloperoxidase assay was used to determine neutrophil accumulation within the  brain. Elevations in intracranial pressure from baseline values were  significantly greater in the untreated (control) animals at all time points (p <  0.0001). Mean lesion size (% hemisphere +/- SEM) was significantly reduced in  animals receiving U83836E (4.41 +/- 0.64, n = 6) when compared with controls  (15.09 +/- 2.28, n = 9, p < 0.001). A reduction in both the release of  oxygen-free radicals and in neutrophil aggregation following the cryogenic injury  in the U83836E animals correlated with a smaller lesion volume.(ABSTRACT  TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - Enhanced nitric oxide (NO) generation by stimulated NO synthase (NOS) activity may, through its oxidative metabolism contribute to tissue injury in experimental  colitis. In this study the possible amelioration of experimental colitis by  NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), an inhibitor of NOS activity, was  evaluated. Colitis was induced in rats by intracolonic administration of 30 mg  trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNB) dissolved in 0.25 ml 50% ethanol or by  flushing the colon of capsaicin pretreated rats with 2 ml of 5% acetic acid. In  several experiments, L-NAME 0.1 mg/ml was added to the drinking water at the time  of colitis induction with TNB or seven days before acetic acid treatment. Rats  were killed at various time intervals after induction of colitis. A 10 cm distal  colonic segment was isolated, weighed, lesion area measured, and explants organ  cultured for 24 hours for determination of NO generation by the Greiss reaction.  The rest of the mucosa was scraped for determination of myeloperoxidase and NOS  activities and leukotriene generation. In TNB treated rats mean arterial pressure  was also determined up to 72 hours after damage induction, with or without  cotreatment with nitroprusside. L-NAME significantly decreased the extent of  tissue injury in TNB treated rats. Seven days after TNB treatment lesion area was  reduced by 55%, colonic weight by 37%, and myeloperoxidase and NOS activity by  59% and 42%, respectively. Acetic acid induced colitis in capsaicin pretreated  rats was also significantly decreased by L-NAME. Twenty four hours after acetic  acid treatment lesion area was reduced by 61%, colonic weight by 21% and NOS  activity by 39%. Mean (SEM) arterial blood pressure in TNB+L-NAME treated rats  was 37.6 (8.1) mm Hg higher than in TNB treated rats, an effect that was only  partially abolished by nitroprusside. These results show that inhibition of NO  synthesis by an L-arginine analogue significantly ameliorates the extent of  tissue injury in two models of experimental colitis, an effect that is not due  only to its vasoconstrictor properties. Modulation of NO generation may be a  novel therapeutic approach in inflammatory bowel disease.

AB  - Intravascular perfluorochemical (PFC) emulsions together with a high oxygen (O2) tension may increase the delivery of dissolved O2 to useful levels. A severely  anemic model of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was used to test the hypothesis that  a novel PFC emulsion (PFCE; Oxygent [Alliance Pharmaceutical Corp., San Diego,  CA] 90% w/v perflubron) used at a high PO2 during bypass delivers sufficient O2  to ameliorate hypoxic myocardial contractile dysfunction. Acutely anemic dogs (N  = 42; hematocrit = 15.8 +/- 0.6% [mean +/- SEM] before CPB and 10.9 +/- 0.1%  during CPB) were divided into four groups. Group 1 was a control (n = 12). As CPB  was initiated, groups 2 (n = 10), 3 (n = 10), and 4 (n = 10) had 1.35 g PFC.kg-1,  2.7 g PFC.kg-1, or 5.4 g PFC.kg-1 added via the venous return cannula. Pre-CPB  and post-CPB cardiac function was measured by the first derivative of left  ventricular pressure (dP/dtmax). The dP/dtmax on separation from CPB was: group  1, 619 +/- 96; group 2, 738 +/- 56; group 3, 782 +/- 101; and group 4, 828 +/-  100 (p < 0.05 groups 3 and 4 versus group 1). Mortality during the first hour  after separation from CPB was higher in group 1 than in PFCE treated dogs;  however, this trend did not attain statistical significance (p < 0.065). The PFC  dose was higher in survivors than in nonsurvivors (2.6 +/- 0.4 g PFC.kg-1 versus  1.2 +/- 0.5 g PFC.kg-1; p < 0.05). A PFCE used at a high PO2 provides sufficient  physically dissolved O2 to relieve myocardial hypoxic injury in a severely anemic  model of CPB. Current PFCEs are effective O2 carriers. This finding suggests that  they can be used as a temporary erythrocyte substitute to diminish the need for  allogeneic transfusions during cardiac operations.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: A blocking monoclonal antibody to intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), CL18/6, previously has been demonstrated to inhibit neutrophil  attachment to isolated vascular endothelium and cardiomyocytes. Due to the well  known participation of ICAM-1 in the inflammatory responses associated with  myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury, we investigated if CL18/6 could attenuate  myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury in vivo. METHODS: Saline (3-5 ml, i.v., n  = 6), non-blocking control MAb CL18/1D8 or CL18/6 (both 0.5 mg kg-1, i.v., n = 4)  were administered prior to coronary occlusion (1 h) and subsequent reperfusion (5  h) produced by inflation of a coronary balloon angioplasty catheter in  isoflurane-anesthetized, closed-chest dogs. Heart rate and arterial pressure were  measured, and regional myocardial blood flow (rMBF), and myeloperoxidase activity  (MPO) to index local neutrophil sequestration, were determined. Myocardial  infarct size (IS) was evaluated using the tetrazolium staining technique and  expressed as a percent of area at risk (AR). RESULTS: Changes in heart rate and  arterial pressure were insignificant throughout the experiment. rMBF (mean +/-  s.e.m.) in the ischemic subendocardium for each treatment group was: Saline (0.07  +/- 0.02 ml min-1 g-1); CL18/1D8 (0.04 +/- 0.02); CL18/6 (0.06 +/- 0.02). IS/AR%  was: saline (37 +/- 3%); CL18/1D8 (39 +/- 9%); CL18/6 (15 +/- 4%*); * =  significantly different from CL18/1D8 and saline, P < 0.05. MPO assayed from AR  immediately adjacent to the infarct was significantly reduced below infarct MPO  only in the CL18/6 treated group-36%). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that  CL18/6 antagonism of ICAM-1 provided cardioprotection associated with reduced  neutrophil activity in vulnerable myocardium, and suggest that ICAM-1 mediated  neutrophil sequestration in endangered cardiac tissue is an important mechanism  of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury.

TI  - Cardiac and skeletal muscle myoglobin release after reperfusion of injured myocardium in dogs with systemic hypotension.
AU  - Spangenthal, E. J.
AU  - Ellis, A. K.
T2  - Circulation
AB  - BACKGROUND: Myoglobin (Mb) is an intramyocardial protein that is released into the systemic circulation and rapidly cleared via the kidneys after myocardial  injury. Arterial Mb concentration-time curves have been studied in humans and  dogs in the setting of acute coronary artery occlusion, and the rate of rise of  Mb is both sensitive and specific as an indicator of successful coronary artery  reperfusion. Systemic hypotension may alter Mb kinetics and impact on the utility  of this method by causing Mb release from ischemic skeletal muscle and by  decreasing renal Mb clearance. This study was undertaken to determine whether  analysis of Mb kinetics remains accurate in identifying coronary reperfusion in  the setting of systemic hypotension. METHODS AND RESULTS: Eighteen chronically  instrumented dogs were made hypotensive by being bled via a large-bore femoral  artery catheter into a reservoir adjusted to maintain a constant mean arterial  pressure of 50 mm Hg for 8 hours. After the first hour of hypotension, each dog  was studied under one of the following three protocols: group 1, 2 hours of  mid-left anterior descending artery (LAD) occlusion followed by 5 hours of  unlimited reperfusion; group 2, 7 hours of mid-LAD occlusion without reperfusion;  or group 3, 7 additional hours of hypotension alone. Systemic lactate extractions  demonstrated a shift to anaerobic metabolism in skeletal muscle and confirmed  that shock was established in all animals. Regional arteriovenous Mb differences  in group 1 animals demonstrated release of large amounts of Mb from reperfused  myocardium; in contrast, smaller amounts of Mb were released both from skeletal  muscle rendered ischemic by hypotension and from myocardium rendered ischemic by  coronary occlusion without reperfusion. In group 1 dogs, arterial Mb rose rapidly  immediately after reperfusion, with peak Mb occurring 108 +/- 24 minutes (mean  +/- SEM) after vessel reopening. In group 2 and group 3 dogs, arterial Mb rose  more slowly, such that peak Mb was not reached within 8 hours in 11 of 12  animals. The linear rate of rise of arterial Mb over the first hour of  reperfusion in group 1 dogs was 51 +/- 16 ng.mL-1.min-1. This slope was  significantly greater than slopes determined over the same time period in dogs  occluded and not reperfused (group 2, 1.2 +/- 0.6 ng.mL-1.min-1) and in those  hypotensive alone (group 3, 0.8 +/- 0.5 ng.mL-1.min-1). All the slopes of group 2  and group 3 dogs fell below the range of slopes of group 1 dogs. In contrast to  slopes of the Mb concentration-time curves, linear creatine kinase slopes were  significantly less sensitive in predicting reperfusion. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of  plasma Mb kinetics allows early identification of coronary reperfusion after  myocardial injury even in the presence of significant systemic hypotension.

TI  - Pyruvate dehydrogenase influences postischemic heart function.
AU  - Lewandowski, E. D.
AU  - White, L. T.
T2  - Circulation
AB  - BACKGROUND: The pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) enzyme complex determines the extent of carbohydrate oxidation in the myocardium. PDH is in a largely inactive state  during early reperfusion of postischemic myocardium. The resultant decrease in  pyruvate oxidation in postischemic hearts has been documented with 13C nuclear  magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. This study demonstrates that counteracting  depressed pyruvate oxidation can enhance contractile recovery in the absence of  increases in either glycolytic activity or glucose oxidation. The findings  indicate that increased incorporation of carbon units from pyruvate into the  intermediates of the oxidative pathways by PDH influences the metabolic  efficiency and mechanical work of postischemic hearts. METHODS AND RESULTS:  Isolated rabbit hearts were situated in an NMR magnet and perfused or reperfused  (10 minutes of ischemia) with 2.5 mmol/L [3-13C]pyruvate as sole substrate to  target PDH directly and bypass the glycolytic pathway. Hearts were observed with  or without activation of PDH with dichloroacetate. Mechanical function and oxygen  consumption (MVO2) were monitored. 13C and 31P NMR spectroscopy allowed  observations of pyruvate oxidation and bioenergetic state in intact, functioning  hearts. Metabolite content and 13C enrichment levels were then determined with in  vitro NMR spectroscopy and biochemical assay. PDH activation did not affect  performance of normal hearts. Postischemic hearts with augmented pyruvate  oxidation (dichloroacetate-treated) sustained improved mechanical function  throughout 40 minutes of reperfusion. Rate-pressure-product (RPP) increased from  8300 +/- 1800 (mean +/- SEM) in untreated postischemic hearts to 21,300 +/- 2400  in hearts treated with dichloroacetate (P < .05). Oxygen use per unit work [MVO2  multiplied by 10(4) divided by RPP] was improved from 1.50 +/- 0.13 to 1.14 +/-  0.11 (P < .05) without differences in high-energy phosphate content between  treated and untreated hearts. Values of dP/dt were also consistently higher, by  as much as 185%, during reperfusion with dichloroacetate. Postischemic hearts  displayed reduced pyruvate oxidation from the incorporation of 13C into the  tissue glutamate pool. With the tissue alanine level as a marker of 13C-enriched  pyruvate availability in the cell, the ratio of labeled glutamate to alanine was  only 58% of the control value during early reperfusion. With dichloroacetate,  that ratio was 167% greater than that of untreated hearts (P < .05). By the end  of the reperfusion period, the 13C enrichment of the tissue glutamate pool by  pyruvate oxidation was elevated from dichloroacetate treatment (untreated, 62 +/-  7%; DCA-treated, 81 +/- 6%; P < .05), but glycogen content was similar in both  groups and 13C enrichment of tissue alanine remained unchanged, near 60%,  indicating no increases in glycolytic end-product formation. CONCLUSIONS:  Metabolic reversal of contractile dysfunction was achieved in isolated hearts by  counteracting depressed PDH activity in the postischemic myocardium. Improved  cardiac performance did not result from, nor require, increased glycolysis  secondary to the activation of PDH. Rather, restoring carbon flux through PDH  alone was sufficient to improve mechanical work by postischemic hearts.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI) therapy, but not angiotensin II subtype I receptor blockade, has been shown to attenuate left ventricular  remodeling in the dog after transmyocardial direct current (DC) shock. The  purpose of this study was to address the importance of preservation of bradykinin  to the antiremodeling effect of CEI treatment in this model. METHODS AND RESULTS:  Twenty-four hours after DC shock, adult mongrel dogs were assigned to one of  three groups: a control group; a group treated with ramipril 10 mg BID; and a  group treated with ramipril 10 mg BID along with a continuous subcutaneous  infusion of HOE 140, a bradykinin antagonist. To assess change in left and right  ventricular structure, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study was performed 4  weeks after DC shock and compared with a baseline MRI study performed before DC  shock. The increase in left ventricular mass (mean +/- SEM) in the control group  was similar to that observed in the CEI-HOE 140 group (+0.73 +/- 0.19 versus  +0.75 +/- 0.18 g/kg, P = NS), but both were greater than the change in mass in  the ramipril group (-0.48 +/- 0.13 g/kg, P = .004 and P = .0005, respectively).  No significant change occurred in left ventricular volume or right ventricular  structure in any group. Mean arterial pressure was reduced by ramipril compared  with the control group (-8 +/- 2 versus +7 +/- 2 mm Hg, P = .03), and this effect  was not blunted by the addition of HOE 140 (-7 +/- 3 mm Hg). CONCLUSIONS:  Prevention by ramipril of the early increase in left ventricular mass in the DC  shock model appears to be related to the preservation of bradykinin.

AU  - Raschke, P.

T2  - Cardiovascular research
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim was to establish whether polymorphonuclear neutrophils can, by themselves, elicit depression of postischaemic heart function immediately after  short periods of ischaemia, and to examine the involvement of endogenous  adenosine and platelet activating factor (PAF) in the observed phenomena.  METHODS: Isolated buffer perfused guinea pig hearts performing pressure-volume  work under standardised conditions were subjected to 15 min of global ischaemia.  Constant flow reperfusion (5 ml.min-1) was carried out in the presence or absence  of homologous neutrophils (approximately 2000 cells.microliters-1 perfusate).  After 15 min of reflow, work was resumed and functional recovery assessed another  20 min later. RESULTS: In hearts perfused only with Krebs-Henseleit buffer,  postischaemic heart function recovered to 67(SEM 3)% (n = 13) of the preischaemic  value. As early as the first minute of reperfusion, the application of  neutrophils already led to a significant decrease in recovery to 39(3)% (n = 12;  P < 0.05). Without ischaemia, neutrophils did not have any deleterious effect,  recovery of external heart work amounting to 91(4)% (n = 6). Adenosine  concentrations measured in the coronary effluent after ischaemia were  substantially increased during reperfusion from preischaemic values of < 20 nM to  about 800 nM. The adenosine A1 receptor antagonist  dipropyl-8-cyclopentyl-xanthine prevented the neutrophil dependent loss of heart  function, as did application of the PAF receptor antagonist WEB 2086, recoveries  being 60(4)% (n = 6) and 58(8)% (n = 6), respectively. In contrast, the A2  antagonist 3,7-dimethyl-1-propargyl-xanthine tended to worsen the neutrophil  induced dysfunction of the heart, recovery amounting to 18(2)% (n = 5).  CONCLUSIONS: Even after brief ischaemia, neutrophils introduced into the coronary  system can exacerbate reperfusion injury. Adenosine, through its A1 receptor, and  PAF appear to play a significant role as mediators of this action.

AB  - Reperfusion of ischemic myocardium may aggravate the ischemic state of injury and thus augment infarct size (reperfusion injury). The aim of this study was to  reduce infarct size by an intervention at the time of reperfusion that acts only  on a reperfusion-specific pathomechanism. It was investigated whether SIN-1C, a  metabolite of molsidomine, can protect against reperfusion injury in canine  hearts in vivo. Ten anesthetized open chest dogs underwent 1 h of left anterior  descendent artery (LAD) occlusion and were randomly assigned to receive either  intracoronary SIN-1C or vehicle infusion as a placebo during the first hour of  reperfusion. The infusion was adjusted to LAD flow to achieve a regional blood  concentration of 5 x 10(-3) M. Infarct size was assessed by triphenyltetrazolium  staining after 6 h of reperfusion. Left ventricular pressure (LVP) was similar in  both groups (SIN-1C: 101 +/- 6, placebo: 89 +/- 6 mm Hg, mean +/- SEM, n = 5) at  the beginning of the experiment and did not change significantly thereafter from  baseline values in both groups. During SIN-1C infusion, the LAD flow was  increased (SIN-1C: 195 +/- 38, control: 86 +/- 17 ml/min/100 g at 30 min of  reperfusion, p < 0.05), while systemic hemodynamics remained unaltered. A  reduction in infarct size (percent of area at risk) was seen in the SIN-1C group  (11.4 +/- 2.8%) compared with the placebo group (24.4 +/- 3.9%, p < 0.05).  Infusion of papaverin (5 x 10(-5) M) following an identical protocol caused a  similar vasodilation as SIN-IC, but did not reduce infarct size in five  additional dox experiments.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

T2  - British journal of anaesthesia
AB  - To determine the effects of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) on tracheal cuff pressure, we have measured intracuff pressure (ICP) in 29 consecutive patients  undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB. Premedication comprised hyoscine and, after  induction of anaesthesia with diazepam and fentanyl, followed by vecuronium, the  trachea was intubated using a Portex Profile tracheal tube. Anaesthesia was  maintained with high-dose fentanyl and 100% oxygen. ICP was measured with a  transducer and the ICP was adjusted to 20 mm Hg. CPB was used with mild to deep  hypothermia and blood-gas tensions were regulated according to alpha-stat  (temperature uncorrected) pH management. Before CPB, ICP was significantly  reduced from the mean baseline value of 20 (SEM 0.2) to 16.7 (0.6) mm Hg (P <  0.01). ICP changed significantly during CPB, decreasing to 8.0 (1.0) mm Hg before  rewarming (P < 0.01 vs immediately before CPB) and increasing to 17.0 (0.6) mm Hg  after the start of rewarming (P < 0.01 vs before rewarming). After CPB, ICP did  not differ significantly from that immediately before CPB. We conclude that the  decrease in ICP during the hypothermic phase of CPB may protect the tracheal  mucosa against hypotensive ischaemic injury.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The benefits of hypothermia for preventing ischemic injury are well known, but its application in surgery to protect the whole body during procedures  requiring circulatory arrest is currently limited to < 1 hour at 15 degrees C  using 50% hemodilution. In a significant departure from previous methods, we have  developed a technique of asanguineous blood substitution with low-flow perfusion  and cardiac arrest at < 10 degrees C in a canine model. Our approach has been to  design a hypothermic blood substitute that would protect the brain and visceral  organs during several hours of bloodless perfusion. Two different solutions have  been designed to fulfill separate requirements in the procedure. METHODS AND  RESULTS: With the use of extracorporeal cardiac bypass, 14 adult dogs were  exsanguinated during cooling; 11 dogs were blood substituted using in combination  the "purge" and "maintenance" solutions (group 1), and 3 dogs were perfused  throughout with the "purge" solution alone as controls (group 2). After cardiac  arrest, the solutions were continuously circulated for 3 1/2 hours by the  extracorporeal pump (flow rate, 40 to 85 mL.kg-1.min-1; mean arterial blood  pressure, 25 to 40 mm Hg). The temperature was maintained at < 10 degrees C  (nadir, 6.6 +/- 0.1 degrees C) for 3 hours, and the hematocrit was kept at < 1%  before controlled rewarming and autotransfusion. In the experimental group, the  heart always started spontaneously in the temperature range of 11 degrees C to 27  degrees C, and 8 animals have survived long-term (current range, 14 to 110 weeks)  without any detectable neurological deficit. In contrast, two control animals  survived after extensive and aggressive cardiac resuscitation efforts; after  surgery they exhibited transient motor and sensory deficits for approximately 1  week. Evaluation of biochemical and hematological parameters showed only a  transient and inconsequential elevation in enzymes (eg, brain, liver, cardiac) in  group 1 compared with the markedly greater elevations in group 2. For example,  immediate postoperative values (mean +/- SEM) for lactate dehydrogenase were 114  +/- 10 for group 1 versus 490 +/- 210 for group 2 (P < .03); for SGOT, values  were 93 +/- 18 for group 1 versus 734 +/- 540 for group 2 (P < .05). On day 1 for  creatine kinase (CK), the group 1 value was 7841 +/- 2307 versus 71,550 +/- 2658  for group 2 (P = .03), and for CK-BB, the group 1 value was 108 +/- 22 versus 617  +/- 154 for group 2 (P = .03). Neurological evaluation using deficit scores (NDS)  was based on a modification of the Glasgow Coma Scale score: 0, normal; 1,  minimal abnormality; 2, weakness; 3, paralysis; 4, coma; and 5, death. At days 1  and 2 after surgery, NDS (mean +/- SEM) were 0 +/- 0 for the experimental group  versus 1.5 +/- 0.5 for the control group. At days 3 and 7 after surgery, NDS were  0 +/- 0 for group 1 versus 1.0 +/- 1.0 for group 2. CONCLUSIONS: The faster  neurological recovery of dogs treated with the "intracellular-type" maintenance  solution supports the biochemical data showing the benefits of this type of blood  substitute for extending the safe limits of hypothermic cardiac arrest procedures  to > 3 hours.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The local myocardial overflow and tissue content of endothelin-like immunoreactivity (ET-LI) during ischaemia and reperfusion as well as the coronary  vascular effects of endothelin were characterised in anaesthetised pigs. METHODS:  Ischaemia was induced by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery  for 45 min followed by 4 h of reperfusion. ET-LI was analysed in plasma from the  anterior interventricular coronary vein and aorta for estimation of local  overflow and in myocardial tissue. Endothelin analogues were given in the  coronary artery for determination of local vascular effects. RESULTS: During  reperfusion, but not during ischaemia, the veno-arterial concentration difference  of ET-LI increased, resulting in a significantly increased overflow at between 10  and 120 min of reperfusion. The tissue concentration of ET-LI in the left  ventricle was seven times higher in the ischaemic/reperfused area than in the  non-ischaemic area: 161(SEM 30.5) v 25.3(3.8) fmol.g-1, P < 0.05. The increase in  myocardial ET-LI was attenuated by 70% (P < 0.01) by coronary venous  retroinfusion of the nitric oxide substrate L-arginine, whereas the overflow was  unaffected. Chromatographic characterisation of the myocardial ET-LI showed that  it was similar to endothelin-1. Intracoronary administration of endothelin-1,  endothelin-3, and the endothelin ETB receptor agonist [Ala1,3,11,15]ET-1 evoked  dose dependent coronary vasoconstriction, and reductions in left ventricular  dP/dt and arterial blood pressure. Endothelin-1 was two times more potent than  endothelin-3 and 10 times more potent than [Ala1,3,11,15]ET-1. CONCLUSIONS:  Myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion evokes enhanced local overflow of ET-LI during  the reperfusion period combined with an increased tissue concentration of ET-LI  which is is attenuated by L-arginine. Endothelin evokes potent coronary  vasoconstriction via activation of both ETA and ETB receptors.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim was to examine the effects of aldosterone and of an aldosterone antagonist, spironolactone, on neointimal thickening in a rabbit  model of balloon injury. METHODS: Eighteen rabbits underwent aortic and iliac  balloon injury and were randomised to subcutaneous infusion of aldosterone (70  micrograms.kg-1.d-1) or vehicle solution for 28 d. Eighteen other rabbits were  randomised to receive daily subcutaneous injections of spironolactone (50  mg.kg-1.d-1) or of vehicle for 7 d before injury and for 28 d after the  procedure. All animals were then killed just after measurement of plasma renin  activity and of arterial pressure. Vessels were fixed and five cross sections  were analysed per rabbit (three aortic; two from iliac artery). Mean values of  neointimal area and of the neointimal area/medial area ratio were calculated.  RESULTS: Aldosterone treatment was associated with a decrease in renin activity  and a non-significant increase in mean arterial pressure. Aldosterone  significantly augmented the neointimal thickening in the iliac artery [0.42(SEM  0.07) v 0.24(0.03) mm2, P < 0.05] but not in the aorta [0.63(0.08) v 0.59(0.12)  mm2, NS]. Spironolactone significantly inhibited intimal thickening, both in the  iliac artery [0.09(0.02) v 0.29(0.01) mm2, P < 0.001] and in the aorta  [0.31(0.03) v 0.59(0.06) mm2, P < 0.001]. Spironolactone administration was  associated with an increase in renin activity and a decrease in mean arterial  blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: Aldosterone administration enhances neointimal  thickening after injury and spironolactone, an aldosterone antagonist, is a  potent inhibitor of neointimal thickening in the same model. This suggests a role  for aldosterone in the pathophysiology of neointimal proliferation after balloon  injury and for aldosterone antagonists in its prevention.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We tested the hypothesis that dismutation of superoxide anion increases endogenous levels of nitric oxide, resulting in inhibition of cyclic  variations in blood flow in arteries that are injured and stenotic. BACKGROUND:  Platelet adhesion and aggregation leading to cyclic flow variations might result,  in part, from generation of superoxide anion that can deplete endogenously  produced nitric oxide. METHODS: Spontaneous cyclic flow variations, monitored  with a proximal Doppler probe, were induced in the carotid artery of anesthetized  rabbits by clamping the vessel with forceps and placing a high grade stenosis at  the site of injury. Bovine copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (12 mg/kg body  weight, n = 5), a synthetic low molecular weight mimetic (12 mg/kg, n = 8) or  buffer vehicle (n = 8) was administered intravenously as divided boluses over 45  min, and the frequency of cyclic flow variations was monitored for 4 h. RESULTS:  Cyclic flow variations remained stable for 4 h in vehicle-treated animals (15 +/-  1 [mean +/- SEM]/30 min at baseline and 16 +/- 1/30 min after 4 h, n = 8) but  exhibited a marked and persistent reduction in animals given copper/zinc  superoxide dismutase (from 14 +/- 1/30 min at baseline to 4 +/- 1/30 min after 4  h) or the mimetic (from 15 +/- 1/30 min at baseline to 3 +/- 1/30 min after 4 h,  p < 0.005). They were restored in three of four mimetic-treated animals during  infusion of NG-monomethyl- L-arginine (100 mg/kg), an inhibitor of nitric oxide  production. In addition, levels of cyclic guanosine 5'-monophosphate in platelets  were elevated after administration of the mimetic (from 2.4 +/- 0.5 fmol/10(6)  platelets at baseline to 4.9 +/- 0.6 fmol/10(6) platelets 45 min after the  mimetic, p < 0.03, n = 6), whereas mean arterial blood pressure was decreased and  flow velocity in the carotid artery was increased consistent with mediation of  the effect on cyclic flow variations by increased endogenous nitric oxide.  CONCLUSIONS: Dismutation of superoxide anion appears to attenuate platelet  thrombus formation at a site of vessel injury by potentiation of endogenously  produced nitric oxide. This approach may have utility to inhibit platelet-rich  thrombosis in injured and stenotic arteries where production of superoxide anion  is increased.

AB  - 1. Patients with obstructive jaundice are especially susceptible to acute renal failure. We have previously observed that in rats with bile duct ligation  impaired renal function is associated with increased urinary thromboxane  excretion. 2. In the present study we therefore investigated, in rats with bile  duct ligation, renal function, urinary thromboxane excretion and thromboxane B2  synthesis by isolated glomeruli as well as the effects of the thromboxane  A2/prostaglandin H2 receptor antagonist Daltroban on renal function in rats with  bile duct ligation as compared with sham-operated rats. 3. On the fourth day  after bile duct ligation (n = 7 rats) endogenous creatinine clearance as an  estimate of glomerular filtration rate was significantly reduced to 0.74 +/- 0.05  (SEM) as compared with 1.06 +/- 0.09 ml min-1 g-1 kidney weight in sham-operated  rats (n = 7, P < 0.01). In rats with bile duct ligation, urine volume was  slightly increased, whereas urinary sodium (Na+) (P < 0.001) and potassium (K+)  (P < 0.01) excretion as well as urine osmolarity (P < 0.05) were significantly  reduced and lower than in sham-operated rats. 4. Urinary thromboxane excretion  was significantly higher in rats with bile duct ligation than in sham-operated  rats: 116.6 +/- 22.3 versus 56.8 +/- 10.2 pmol 24 h-1 100 g-1 body weight (P <  0.05). Thromboxane B2 synthesis in glomeruli isolated from rats with bile duct  ligation was also significantly higher than in sham-operated rats: 12.6 +/- 2.0  versus 6.4 +/- 0.9 pmol h-1 mg-1 protein (P < 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250  WORDS)

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To demonstrate and define normal lymphatic transit times by lymphoscintigraphy and to evaluate the efficacy of the currently recommended  first-aid measures for the management of snake or spider envenomation. SETTING:  The nuclear medicine department of a major teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS AND  DESIGN: Twenty-four subjects received either intradermal or subcutaneous  injections of 99mtechnetium antimony sulfur colloid (0.1 mL) in both  hands/forearms and feet/legs. This simulated a snake or spider bite. Fifteen of  the subjects had first-aid in the form of firm bandages and splints applied to an  upper and a lower limb immediately after injection. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The  progress of the radiotracer was followed with a large field of view gamma camera.  If no egress of radiotracer was seen in the bandaged limbs, the subject walked  until radioactivity was detected. RESULTS: The mean (+/- SEM)  periphery-to-systemic circulation transit time after subcutaneous injection was  58 (+/- 7) minutes. The first-aid was found to be very effective when applied  with bandage pressures ranging from 40 to 70 mmHg (5.3-9.3 kPa) in the upper limb  and 55 to 70 mmHg (7.3-9.3 kPa) in the lower limb. Lower and higher bandage  pressures were ineffective. However, despite first-aid measures, egress of  radiotracer, even in the upper limbs, was seen in all subjects who walked for 10  minutes or more. CONCLUSIONS: Firm pressure bandaging is an effective means of  restricting the lymphatic flow of toxins after envenomation, provided the bandage  is applied within the defined pressure range. Strict limb immobilisation is  necessary to minimise lymphatic flow, and walking after upper or lower limb  envenomation will inevitably result in systemic envenomation despite first-aid  measures.

AB  - Brief periods of ischemia have been suggested to protect against myocardial injury caused by a subsequent episode of prolonged ischemia and reperfusion.  However, the protective effects of brief ischemic periods against myocardial  dysfunction after prolonged myocardial ischemia are controversial. To examine  whether the protective effects of brief ischemic episodes relate to the extent of  prior ischemic events, isolated rat hearts were subjected to either no  preischemia (group A); one 5-minute episode of preischemia and 10 minutes of  reperfusion (group B); or two 1-minute episodes of ischemia, each followed by 5  minutes of reperfusion (group C). All hearts were then subjected to 15 minutes of  total ischemia and 10 minutes of reperfusion. In group A, after 10 min of  reperfusion coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) was 31% +/- 10% (mean +/- SEM)  higher than the control value, peak force of cardiac contraction (FCC) was 64%  +/- 5% lower, and heart rate was 18% +/- 3% lower. In group B, CPP increased 26%  +/- 6%, FCC fell 58% +/- 7%, and heart rate decreased 22% +/- 8% (group B vs  group A, P value not significant) after ischemia and reperfusion. In group C, CPP  increased 23% +/- 7%, FCC decreased 57% +/- 8%, and heart rate fell 8% +/- 4% on  reperfusion (group C vs groups A and B, P value not significant). Creatine kinase  (CK) was measured in the hearts from different groups and was found to be  similar. Release of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) metabolites hypoxanthine,  inosine, and adenosine was also not different in the coronary effluents of the  three groups of hearts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - Normal myocardium can derive energy for contraction and relaxation from oxidative metabolism of a variety of substrates. This investigation examined the influence  of substrate availability early during reperfusion on the substrate pattern of  oxidative metabolism and recovery of contractile function. For this purpose,  isovolumically beating isolated rat hearts, perfused retrogradely with  erythrocyte-supplemented buffer containing 0.4 mmol/L palmitate and 11 mmol/L  glucose, were subjected to 40 minutes of no-flow ischemia. Hearts were reperfused  with medium containing selected concentrations of palmitate and glucose. The  substrate pattern for oxidative metabolism was determined on the basis of  myocardial release of 14CO2 after equilibration of the hearts during the initial  15 minutes of reperfusion with either [1-14C]palmitate or [U-14C]glucose. In  continuously perfused control hearts, glucose oxidation was largely inhibited by  palmitate. During postischemic reperfusion, oxidation of glucose was increased by  59% (P < .05) and 467% (P <.01) in hearts reperfused after the ischemic period  with 11 mmol/L glucose plus 0.4 or 1.2 mmol/L palmitate, respectively. Oxidation  of palmitate was concomitantly reduced during reperfusion at low (0.4 mmol/L) but  not at high (1.2 mmol/L) palmitate concentration. Compared with hearts reperfused  with medium containing 0.4 mmol/L palmitate as sole substrate, hearts reperfused  with medium containing 11 mmol/L glucose with 0.4 mmol/L palmitate exhibited  lower left ventricular diastolic pressure (69 +/- 5 versus 90 +/- 3 mm Hg [mean  +/- SEM], P < .05), less release of creatine kinase (31 +/- 5 versus 59 +/- 7 U/g  wet wt, P < .05), and better recovery of left ventricular pressure development  (26 +/- 9 versus 6 +/- 4 mm Hg, P < .05). Omission of palmitate or increasing the  palmitate concentration to 1.2 mmol/L did not significantly alter postischemic  myocardial contracture and enzyme release. The findings support the view that  glucose oxidation early during reperfusion may be crucial for functional  recovery. The results further indicate that interaction of substrates of  oxidative metabolism is altered in severely injured postischemic myocardium.  Inhibition of glucose oxidation by fatty acids was partially reversed during  reperfusion.

AB  - Reperfusion of ischaemic intestine is characterised by an initial hyperaemia with ensuing mucosal repair. This study investigated possible roles for gut vasoactive  neuropeptides and trophic peptides in these phenomena. Groups of rats were  monitored during superior mesenteric artery occlusion for five or 20 minutes,  with or without subsequent reperfusion for five minutes. Peptide concentrations  (fmol/ml) in arterial blood, were measured using specific radioimmunoassays.  Intestinal ischaemia alone did not cause haemodynamic disturbance or peptide  release. Reperfusion, after five minutes of ischaemia, resulted in arterial  hypotension and a rise in plasma vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (mean (SEM))  (37 (3), control 11 (4), p < 0.001). After 20 minutes of ischaemia, reperfusion  resulted in greater hypotension (p < 0.05) and release of both vasoactive  intestinal polypeptide (31 (3), p < 0.05 v control) and the more potent  vasodilator beta-calcitonin gene related peptide (49 (3), control 23 (1), p <  0.001). By contrast, the vasodilators alpha-calcitonin gene related peptide and  substance P and the vasoconstrictors neuropeptide Y, peptide YY, and somatostatin  were not released. Bombesin, a stimulatory neuropeptide, was released after 20  minutes of ischaemia/reperfusion (13 (2), control 7 (3), p < 0.05). Plasma  enteroglucagon rose from control (51 (4)) to 110 (16) (p < 0.001) and to 158 (27)  (p < 0.005) after five and 20 minutes of ischaemia/reperfusion. The potent  enteric vasodilators vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and beta-calcitonin gene  related peptide, unopposed by vasoconstrictors, may promote post-ischaemic  intestinal hyperaemia. The rise in plasma enteroglucagon may point to diffuse  mucosal injury and is consistent with the putative trophic role of this peptide.

AB  - Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), suggested in some studies to suppress astrocyte and neutrophil function, has also reduced ischaemic brain  injury when administered immediately prior to clot embolization in models of  thromboembolic stroke. The effect of TGF-beta 1 as a post-treatment paradigm was  investigated in a rabbit model of thromboembolic stroke. Following clot  embolization, regional cerebral blood flow fell to < 10 cc 100 g-1 min-1 in all  animals. TGF-beta 1 (10 micrograms) or vehicle (n = 5 each group) was infused via  the contralateral carotid artery. TGF-beta 1 administration resulted in a rapid  and selective reduction in the peripheral neutrophil count as compared to a  significant (p < 0.05) increase in control values (2336 +/- 817 vs 4320 +/- 928  neutrophils mm3, mean +/- SEM). Neutrophil aggregation was increased within 30  min of TGF-beta 1 infusion when compared to control (2.07 +/- 0.70 vs 1.09 +/-  0.17 ohms, p < 0.05); neutrophil chemiluminescence, an index of the oxygen  respiratory burst was not significantly affected by TGF-beta 1 administration. No  difference in platelet counts or aggregation was noted. There was no significant  difference between the two groups regarding brain infarct size (47.5 +/- 10.9 vs  56.5 +/- 10.4, n = 4, TGF-beta vs control, mean +/- SEM), intracranial pressure,  or brain excitatory amino acid levels (aspartate and glutamate) within ischaemic  regions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - BACKGROUND: Both heat-shock protein (HSP) 70 and its mRNA are induced in the ischemic myocardium. The inductor stimuli are, however, not known. Stretch and  ischemic metabolic alterations are the two most likely HSP70 inductors. METHODS  AND RESULTS: To assess whether anaerobic metabolism induces HSP70 mRNA  expression, 61 rat hearts were perfused with Krebs-Henseleit buffer (37 degrees  C) in a modified Langendorff apparatus built for rapid switching between  pressure-controlled and flow-controlled perfusions. Each heart was initially  perfused for 30 minutes at a constant perfusion pressure of 65 mm Hg.  Subsequently, separate hearts were perfused at a constant flow of 8, 6, 4, 2, 1,  0.5, or 0 mL/min for 30 minutes using a nonpulsatile pump (n = 5, each perfusion  level). Hemodynamic measurements demonstrated a linear correlation between  coronary flow and both perfusion pressure and developed pressure (r = .94 and r =  .89, respectively; P < .0001 for both comparisons). Diastolic pressure at the end  of the perfusions increased only in globally ischemic hearts (34 +/- 3 mm Hg at 0  mL/min versus 5 +/- 1 mm Hg at 8 mL/min; mean +/- SEM, P < .05). The highest  lactate release during the 30-minute constant-flow period was observed at a flow  level of 4 mL/min (177 +/- 1 versus 71 +/- 8 mumol at 8 mL/min). Creatine kinase  release was detected at 2 mL/min (28 +/- 8 mU/mL after 25 minutes of constant  flow versus < 8 mU/mL at 4 mL/min). The highest flow level showing cessation of  mechanical activity despite pacing of the hearts was at 2 mL/min (2 of 5 hearts).  An increased level of HSP70 mRNA expression was found only at 4 mL/min (10-fold  increase). Blocking lactate production by substituting glucose with  2-deoxyglucose in the perfusion buffer reduced the HSP70 mRNA level by 44% at 4  mL/min. No increase of HSP/70 was detected (Western blots) at any flow level.  CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that anaerobic metabolism is a strong  stimulus for HSP70 transcription and that cessation of anaerobic metabolism in  severe ischemia is associated with a shutdown of HSP70 mRNA expression.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study examined the possible association between endothelin and coronary atherosclerosis and evaluated the synthesis and release of endothelin in  the presence of various stimuli that occur during cardiac catheterization.  BACKGROUND: Circulating endothelin has been reported to be increased in diffuse  atherosclerosis and acute myocardial infarction. However, the relation between  coronary artery disease and endothelin release remains unclear. METHODS: We  measured the plasma and urinary concentrations of endothelin immunoreactivity in  45 patients and 10 healthy control subjects. RESULTS: In group IA (n = 9),  simultaneous blood sampling in the coronary sinus and femoral artery during  coronary angioplasty of the left anterior descending coronary artery demonstrated  no immediate changes in plasma immunoreactive endothelin-1 (ir-ET-1) levels. In  11 patients in group IB undergoing coronary angioplasty of a major artery, we did  not detect changes in peripheral plasma concentrations of ir-ET-1 within 24 h,  but urinary ir-ET-1 levels increased from 9.2 +/- 2.3 to 18.6 +/- 4.9 pg/mg of  creatinine a few hours after coronary angioplasty (mean +/- SEM, p < 0.05). This  increase in urinary endothelin excretion persisted 24 h later. Group II patients  (n = 12) had coronary angiography without coronary angioplasty. Levels of both  plasma and urinary ir-ET-1 did not change during the 24-h follow-up period. There  was no relation between the severity of coronary atherosclerosis and the plasma  or urinary concentrations of ir-ET-1. Systolic aortic pressure correlated with  basal urinary excretion of endothelin (r = 0.54, p = 0.03, n = 15). In group III  (n = 13), levels of ir-ET-1 in patients undergoing right heart catheterization  without angiography did not differ from those in the control group. CONCLUSIONS:  The presence or the severity, or both, of coronary atherosclerosis is not  associated with a detectable increase in endothelin release. The diagnostic  procedures of catheterization do not modify endothelin concentrations in plasma  and urine. Vascular stretch or injury, or both, during coronary angioplasty  increases urinary ir-ET-1 levels a few hours after the procedure. This increase  persists for at least 24 h but is not detectable by brief sampling of peripheral  or coronary sinus blood.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim was to assess the abilities of exogenous noradrenaline, isoprenaline, and phenylephrine to precondition the isolated rat heart against  ischaemic and reperfusion injury. METHODS: The isovolumetric Langendorff rat  heart model was used to determine postischaemic recovery of left ventricular  function. The hearts were subjected to 30 min of normothermic global ischaemia  followed by 30 min reperfusion. Treated hearts were perfused with noradrenaline  (10(-7) M), isoprenaline (10(-8) M), or phenylephrine (10(-6) M, 10(-5) M, and  10(-4) M) for 5 min followed by 5 min washout before the 30 min ischaemic period.  RESULTS: Control hearts recovered 47.6(SEM 4.3)% of baseline heart rate x  developed pressure after 30 min reperfusion, whereas noradrenaline and  isoprenaline treated hearts recovered 75.1(4.6) and 76.4(4.6)%, respectively (p <  0.001 v control). Left ventricular end diastolic pressures at the end of  reperfusion were 48.8(4.0), 20.0(2.4), and 21.6(2.7)mm Hg for control,  noradrenaline treated (p < 0.001 v control), and isoprenaline treated (p < 0.001  v control) hearts respectively. beta Blockade with propranolol during  noradrenaline treatment blocked the protective effects. No concentration of  phenylephrine used was able to enhance postischaemic heart rate x developed  pressure significantly, or result in improved (lower) postischaemic left  ventricular end diastolic pressure. During treatment with noradrenaline and  phenylephrine (10(-5) M), lactate release was 13.0(1.0) and 11.0(0.9) mumol.5  min-1, respectively (p = NS); these values were significantly (p < 0.001) greater  than baseline value of 3.7(0.5) mumol.5 min-1. Immediately before the 30 min  ischaemic period, control and phenylephrine treated groups had glycogen levels of  132(14) and 128(5) nmol.mg-1 protein, respectively (p = NS), whereas the glycogen  content of the noradrenaline treated group was only 96(5) nmol.mg-1 protein (p <  0.05 v control and phenylephrine treated). CONCLUSIONS: Transient beta adrenergic  but not alpha 1 adrenergic stimulation can precondition the isolated perfused rat  heart. The mechanism of protection may, at least in part, be due to transient  demand ischaemia. Partial depletion of glycogen following treatment may play a  role in the observed protective effects.

AB  - The objective of this investigation was to determine the role of nitric oxide synthase in the action of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor,  ramiprilat, to reduce myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. Ramiprilat, the  nitric oxide synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-L-NAME (L-NAME), ramiprilat plus L-NAME,  or saline (n = 8 each group), were administered i.v. in intact animal  preparations of experimentally induced acute myocardial ischemia. Anesthetized,  open-chest rabbits were instrumented for measurement of systemic hemodynamics and  left ventricular pressure from which left ventricular +dP/dtmax was derived.  Animals were subjected to 30 min of left main coronary artery occlusion (marginal  branch) followed by 2 hr of reperfusion. Ramiprilat (50 micrograms/kg) or saline  was administered 5 min before reperfusion, and those rabbits receiving L-NAME  (100 micrograms/kg/min) were pretreated starting 30 min before occlusion  throughout the remainder of the experiment. After reperfusion, myocardial infarct  size (IS) was determined via tetrazolium staining and expressed as a percentage  of area at risk (AR). IS/AR% was significantly reduced in rabbits administered  ramiprilat (19 +/- 3%) compared to those receiving saline (39 +/- 2%), ramiprilat  plus L-NAME (43 +/- 4%) or L-NAME alone (43 +/- 2%; mean +/- S.E.M.; P < .05). AR  as a percent of total left ventricular mass was not different between any of the  four treatment groups. Systemic hemodynamic effects were not significantly  different between groups. The results indicate that the effect of ramiprilat to  reduce infarct size is abolished by pretreatment with L-NAME.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED  AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - The mechanisms by which ischemic preconditioning (IPC) protects against reperfusion (RP) injury are unknown. The purpose of this study was to relate IPC  to postischemic mechanical function, vascular reactivity, and bioenergetics.  Isolated perfused rat hearts were randomized to two groups. Control (CTRL) hearts  underwent 25 min of global, 37 degrees C ischemia and 40 min RP. IPC hearts  underwent 2.5 min ischemia and 10 min RP followed by 25 min ischemia and 40 min  RP (RP40). Left ventricular developed pressure (DP) and coronary flow were  continuously measured. 31P NMR spectra determined phosphocreatine and ATP  concentrations in parallel hearts every 5 min. Results are means +/- SEM; n =  6/group. Significance was assumed for P < 0.05 by paired (within groups) and  unpaired (between groups) t test. CTRL heart DP recovered to 35 +/- 4% of  preischemic (PI) DP by RP40 (P < 0.001), while IPC heart DP reached 99 +/- 4% (P  = NS vs PI; P < 0.001 vs CTRL). CTRL coronary flow recovered to only 75 +/- 3% of  PI (P < 0.001) by RP40. IPC coronary flow exceeded baseline during RP (RP40 = 118  +/- 3%, P < 0.001 vs CTRL; P < 0.05 vs PI). After 25 min ischemia, CTRL heart ATP  fell to 40 +/- 4% of PI (P < 0.001) while the IPC group fell to only 60 +/- 4% (P  < 0.05 IPC vs CTRL; P < 0.001 vs PI). IPC preserves more end-ischemic ATP  compared to CTRL hearts with a resultant improvement in mechanical function  during reperfusion. Only preconditioned hearts preserve the adaptive mechanism(s)  responsible for postischemic vasodilatation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

T2  - The Journal of trauma
AB  - Pharmacologic attempts to reduce edema generation and albumin extravasation into thermally injured skin have until recently been disappointing unless the drugs  (usually antiphlogistic or anti-inflammatory drugs) were given before injury. We  have studied the effect of alpha-trinositol (PP56, i.e.,  1D-myo-inositol-1,2,6-trisphosphate) given after the injury in an experimental  full-thickness 10% TBSA scald burn in anesthetized rats. Total tissue water  content (TTW) and albumin extravasation (Ealb) were determined in injured and  noninjured skin (series I, n = 12). Interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure (Pif)  was measured in injured skin (series II, n = 14). alpha-Trinositol was  administered (alpha-trinositol groups) as an i.v. bolus (40 mg/kg) at 5 minutes  after injury followed by an i.v. infusion (1.3 mg/kg/min). In both series a  placebo group received burn injury and normal saline in equal volumes instead of  alpha-trinositol. Compared with placebo, alpha-trinositol reduced TTW and Ealb as  well as the increased negatively of Pif in injured tissue significantly. The  effect on Ealb was most prominent, with a reduction from 153.9 +/- 35.6 (SEM)  microL/g in the NaCl group to 23.1 +/- 6.3 after alpha-trinositol (p < 0.005).  Total tissue water was reduced from 2.51 +/- 0.13 to 2.17 +/- 0.06 mL/g (p <  0.05) and Pif (measured between 21 and 40 minutes postinjury) from -24.7 +/- 4.1  to -3.2 +/- 1.1 mm Hg (p < 0.005).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - 1. The acute ventilatory response to 3 min periods of hypoxia (AHR) was examined in nine patients with clinically complete spinal cord transection (T4-T7) during  (a) rest and (b) electrically induced leg exercise (EEL). 2. EEL was produced by  surface electrode stimulation of the quadriceps muscles so as to cause the legs  to extend at the knee against gravity. End-tidal PCO2 was held constant 1-2 mmHg  above resting values throughout both protocols. 3. On exercise, the average  increase in metabolic CO2 production (VCO2 +/- S.E.M.) was 41 +/- 5 ml min-1.  Venous lactate levels did not rise with exercise. 4. Baseline euoxic ventilation  did not increase significantly with EEL, but there was a consistent and highly  significant increase in the ventilatory response to hypoxia during EEL (mean  delta AHR +/- S.E.M. of 1.6 +/- 0.21 min-1). 5. We conclude that an increase in  hypoxic sensitivity during exercise can occur in the absence of volitional  control of exercise and in the absence of afferent neural input from the limbs.

T2  - The British journal of surgery
AB  - Intestinal ischaemia and reperfusion cause changes in cardiovascular and pulmonary function. In a rat model, the plasma concentrations of atrial  natriuretic peptide (ANP) and pancreatic glucagon rose on reperfusion after 20  min of intestinal ischaemia, coinciding with significant arterial hypotension:  mean(s.e.m.) ANP 79(13) versus control 36(4) fmol ml-1 (P < 0.01); and  mean(s.e.m.) glucagon 22(2) versus control 10(1) fmol ml-1 (P < 0.001). Glucagon  was also released on reperfusion after 5 min of ischaemia: mean(s.e.m.) 18(2)  fmol ml-1 (P < 0.001 versus control). In a second experiment, pretreatment of  rats with allopurinol did not prevent arterial hypotension but abolished ANP  release (mean(s.e.m.) 36(2)fmol ml-1 versus no pretreatment 70(7) fmol ml-1, P <  0.05), while glucagon release was unaffected. The release of ANP, but not that of  glucagon, is therefore mediated by oxygen free radicals and may signify cardiac  and/or pulmonary injury or dysfunction. The actions of these peptides may be  relevant in the pathophysiological perturbation of intestinal  ischaemia-reperfusion.

AB  - One hundred ASA grade 1 and 2 patients requiring orotracheal intubation for various general surgical procedures were randomly assigned to receive either  expert rigid laryngoscopic or novice fibreoptic orotracheal intubation under  total intravenous anaesthesia. Five anaesthesia residents in the 4th year, with  no prior experience in fibreoptic laryngoscopy, participated in a fibreoptic  training course, viewing two instructional videos and practising on the  intubation manikin. Each resident intubated 20 patients in a randomised fashion  either as an expert laryngoscopist or as a fibreoptic novice. The time (SEM) to  achieve successful intubation was statistically different for fibreoptic and  rigid intubation (77.2 (5.1) s vs 17.7 (1.6) s, p < 0.01). The time to achieve  successful rigid laryngoscopic intubation remained constant over the ten  intubations, whereas time required for fibreoptic intubation decreases  significantly (p < 0.01). The learning objectives (fibreoptic intubation times in  60 s or less and with 90% or greater success rate on the first intubation  attempt) were met by all residents. The haemodynamic profile was similar for  fibreoptically intubated and conventionally intubated patients and there was no  difference between the first two or the last two fibreoptic or rigid intubations.  The study was designed to detect a difference of 10% in means (assuming alpha =  0.05 and beta < or = 0.2). The incidence of postoperative sore throat, dysphagia  or hoarseness was similar in both groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

T2  - Journal of pediatric surgery
AB  - Proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) has become the procedure of choice for many children with ulcerative colitis and familial polyposis. The  modified quadruple-limb (W) IPAA was designed to increase reservoir compliance  and capacity, and to improve functional results by decreasing stool frequency.  However, only limited information has been reported concerning the technical  considerations and functional outcomes from W IPAA modification and utilization  in the pediatric population. Additionally, pediatric IPAA physiological  adaptation, expressed as IPAA volume/pressure relationships, for any type of IPAA  design has not been described. In this report, the authors analyze their  functional and physiological results with W IPAA in 19 children undergoing  colectomy for ulcerative colitis and familial polyposis. Since 1986, 19 children  (5 girls, 14 boys; mean age, 15.3 years [range, 11 to 18 years]) have undergone  proctocolectomy with W IPAA for ulcerative colitis (n = 9) and familial polyposis  (n = 10). IPAA pressure and volume profiles were measured in 10 patients at 2 and  12 months postileostomy takedown, and in five patients at 3 years. W IPAA  compliance was calculated as the change in volume over change in pressure (delta  V/delta P). There were no deaths, anastomotic leaks, or pelvic sepsis. The  24-hour stool frequency (mean +/- SEM) decreased significantly (P < or = .05)  from 4.6 +/- 0.6 at 2 months to 3.3 +/- 0.1 at 12 months. No nighttime evacuation  occurred after 12 months. W IPAA evacuation volume significantly increased (P <  or = .05) from 238 +/- 22.9 mL at 2 months to 346 +/- 26.5 mL at 12 months and  remained stable thereafter.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - Histamine is released from the heart during ischaemia-reperfusion injury. As histamine has cardiac effects, we investigated the role of histamine in  ischaemia-reperfusion injury of isolated rat hearts. A Langendorff-model with 30  min global (37 degrees C) ischaemia followed by 60 min reperfusion was employed.  The effects of ischaemia alone (n = 10, group 1.1 + n = 10, group 2.1, 2  different series), and ischaemia with H1- and H2-receptor blockade with  cimetidine (10 microM, n = 10), chlorpheniramine (10 microM, n = 8), terfenadine  (10 microM, n = 8), and promethazin (10 microM, n = 9), or both cimetidine and  chlorpheniramine (n = 8), were studied. Histamine was measured in the coronary  effluent and cardiac tissue of group 1.1. Release of histamine increased from 6.5  +/- 1 pmol min-1 before ischaemia to 19 +/- 3 pmol min-1 at the start of  reperfusion. Ischaemia decreased left ventricular developed pressure to 18 +/-  11% (1.1) and 50 +/- 11% (2.1) of initial value (mean +/- SEM) at the start of  reperfusion. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure increased from 0 to 79 +/- 8  mmHg (1.1) and 39 +/- 9 (2.1) mmHg, while left ventricular systolic pressure was  unchanged (101 +/- 12% in 1.1 and 101 +/- 10% in 2.1). Severe arrhythmias were  induced in 90 (1.1) and 30 (2.1)% of the hearts, while coronary flow decreased  during reperfusion. H2-blockade did not modify the changes in left ventricular  pressures, coronary flow, or heart rate induced by ischaemia. Three different  H1-blockers increased left ventricular systolic pressure, inhibited the decrease  of developed pressure, attenuated the increase of end-diastolic pressure, and  totally inhibited reperfusion arrhythmias. The effect of both blockers together  was similar to that of H1-blockers alone. Coronary flow was increased during  reperfusion in two of the groups with H1-blocker compared with ischaemic  controls. Increased release of histamine from ischaemic-reperfused rat hearts  concurred with depression of left ventricular function and arrhythmias during  early reperfusion. Cardiac dysfunction during reperfusion was attenuated by three  different H1-receptor blockers.

AB  - In order to identify a critical or an optimal therapeutic value for oxygen delivery and oxygen uptake, we analysed data from 40 publications concerning the  relationship between oxygen delivery and consumption in patients with adult  respiratory distress syndrome, trauma or during sepsis, and in nonseptic  controls. According to the outcome, the patients were allocated to either group 1  (survivors) or group 2 (nonsurvivors). While oxygen delivery and uptake (mean,  SEM) were significantly higher in patients with adult respiratory distress  syndrome (636, SEM 31 ml.min-1.m-2 and 155, SEM 5 ml.min-1.m-2), trauma (782, SEM  77 ml.min-1.m-2 and 167, SEM 10 ml.min-1.m-2) and sepsis (654, SEM 28  ml.min-1.m-2 and 163, SEM 5 ml.min-1.m-2) than in nonseptic controls (452, SEM 18  ml.min-1.m-2 and 126, SEM 3 ml.min-1.m-2, p < 0.05), there were no significant  differences in these parameters between survivors and nonsurvivors. Although  therapeutic manoeuvres were effective in increasing both oxygen delivery and  consumption, these improvements were not paralleled by an increase in survival  rate. The correlation between oxygen delivery and uptake is generally a result of  the use of pooled data and therefore prone to mathematical coupling. This is true  particularly for patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis.  Thus, our study failed to identify either an optimal or a critical value of  oxygen delivery or oxygen consumption in critically ill patients.

AU  - Willeford, K. L.

T2  - Anaesthesia
AB  - A new approach to the internal jugular vein is described which keeps the head and neck in the neutral position and uses bony and cartilaginous landmarks for  guidelines. Venous puncture is made along an axial line drawn superiorly from the  lateral edge of the bony depression caused by the insertion of the  sternocleidomastoid muscle on the superior edge of the clavicle. This line, at  the level of the cricoid cartilage, lies directly over the internal jugular vein.  In 55 patients initially studied, the mean (SEM) number of puncture attempts to  locate the vein was 1.4 (0.2) per patient, with an overall success rate of 98%.  In 84%, the internal jugular vein was located exactly where predicted, the others  were just lateral to the point. The complication rate (all short-term) was 3.6%.  Subsequently the internal jugular vein was cannulated successfully using the  developed technique in 20 consecutive trauma patients with suspected cervical  instability. An average of 1.2 (0.2) (range 1-3) attempts were made per patient  to locate the vein and there were no complications. We propose this technique as  a safe and reliable method of gaining central venous access in patients with  possible cervical spine injury following trauma.

AB  - We evaluated the ability of alpha-phenyl-tert-butyl nitrone (PBN) to trap free radicals and to protect the rat myocardium during ischemia and reperfusion.  Isolated bicarbonate buffer-perfused hearts (n = 8) were subjected to 20 min  global ischemia (37 degrees C) followed by reperfusion with 0.4 to 4.0 mM PBN.  Coronary effluent containing the PBN adduct was extracted in toluene. Electron  spin resonance analysis of the toluene extract revealed a PBN-hydroxyl adduct. To  verify this assignment, a Fenton system was used to generate an authentic  PBN-hydroxyl adduct (n = 8), which yielded the same ESR spectra as the  reperfusion-derived adduct. The structure of the adduct formed in the Fenton  system was confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The ESR parameters  of the PBN-hydroxyl adduct were exquisitely sensitive to solvent polarity during  extraction of the adduct. Extraction of an authentic PBN-hydroxyl adduct into  chloroform, chloroform:methanol, and toluene closely matched the ESR parameters  obtained during reperfusion of ischemic myocardium in other animal models. To  determine whether PBN could confer any protective effect during ischemia or  reperfusion, hearts (n = 8/group) were subjected to 35 min global ischemia at 37  degrees C with the St. Thomas' II cardioplegic solution followed by 30 min  reperfusion. Percent recovery (mean +/- SEM) of developed pressure, rate pressure  product, and leakage of lactate dehydrogenase during reperfusion in control  hearts were 58 +/- 3%, 48 +/- 4% and 3.2 +/- 0.5 IU/15 min/g wet wt. PBN at a  concentration of 0.4 mM or 4.0 mM when present either during ischemia alone or  reperfusion alone did not exert any effect upon recovery of developed pressure,  rate pressure product or post-ischemic enzyme leakage. We conclude that PBN fails  to improve contractile recovery and reduce enzyme leakage during reperfusion of  myocardium subjected to global ischemia.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recent studies reveal success in treating spinal cord trauma with early, high-dose methylprednisolone. As in spinal cord research,  failure to find therapeutic effects with steroids in studies of acute stroke  treatment may reflect institution of treatment too late and at too low dosage. We  presently test the efficacy of stroke treatment with methylprednisolone  administered early and at high doses using a cat temporary middle cerebral artery  occlusion model. METHODS: We occluded the middle cerebral artery for 4 hours in  24 pentobarbital-anesthetized cats. To enhance the probability of brain injury,  we maintained the cats' serum glucose concentrations at high levels both during  occlusion and for 6 hours afterward. Using a blinded, randomized study design, we  treated 12 cats with methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg IV infused over 15 minutes  starting 30 minutes after occlusion followed by 5.4 mg.kg-1.h-1 IV for the next  23 hours) and 12 control cats with vehicle. During and for 8 hours after  occlusion, we monitored cerebral blood flow, brain and rectal temperatures, and  multiple cardiovascular and blood compositional parameters. We assessed brain  pathological outcome after animal survival for 4 days or after acute death from  hemispheric edema. RESULTS: Experimental and control animals showed similar early  mortality rates (treated, 3/12; controls, 4/12). However, surviving  methylprednisolone-treated cats (n = 9) showed a mean infarct size more than six  times smaller than in the control animals (n = 8) (mean +/- SEM, 2.4 +/- 0.7%  versus 15.6 +/- 6.2% of the ischemic territory, respectively; P < .05). The  methylprednisolone-treated animals also showed less marked reduction in cerebral  blood flow during ischemia than did the controls (mean +/- SEM, 58 +/- 5% versus  74 +/- 4%; P < .005). CONCLUSIONS: Administering methylprednisolone at high doses  early after onset of ischemia significantly reduces tissue injury in cats that  survive 4 days of temporary middle cerebral artery occlusion. This improvement in  outcome occurs in the setting of significant increases in ischemic cerebral blood  flow. However, methylprednisolone treatment did not reduce hemispheric edema in  animals that died early after temporary middle cerebral artery occlusion.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate serum angiotensin converting enzyme activity (S-ACE) in sepsis, its association with haemodynamics and pulmonary function, and the  influence of intrapulmonary corticosteroid on its activity in serum. DESIGN:  Randomised, blind, placebo controlled experiment. SETTING: Trauma research  laboratory. MATERIAL: Sixteen juvenile pigs. INTERVENTIONS: Mechanical  ventilation and continuous light anaesthesia. Brief infusion of live  Staphylococcus aureus (4 x 10(10) colony forming units) followed by inhalation of  nebulised beclomethasone dipropionate 50 micrograms/kg (n = 8) or placebo (n = 7)  30 and 360 minutes after the start of the septic challenge. MEASUREMENTS AND  RESULTS: S-ACE activity, vascular pressures, lung mechanics, arterial oxygen  tension, and global oxygen extraction were measured and calculated at regular  intervals. One animal was withdrawn because of pulmonary arterial hypertension at  the start of the experiment. The 15 remaining pigs were studied for 12 hours. The  septic challenge induced a significant but transient increase in S-ACE activity  in 13 animals (mean (SEM) +0.19 (0.06) mu kat/l). There were no significant  differences in S-ACE between the groups. Terminal S-ACE correlated with oxygen  extraction (r = -0.76, p < 0.01), mean arterial pressure (r = 0.69, p < 0.01),  arterial oxygen tension (r = 0.59, p < 0.05) and change in lung/thorax compliance  (r = 0.63, p < 0.02). CONCLUSION: S-ACE activity increases in response to a Gram  positive septic challenge. This is followed by a gradual decline which reflects  to some extent the degree of septic lung injury. S-ACE activity is not influenced  by intrapulmonarily administered corticosteroid.

T2  - Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology
AB  - Lazaroid U-74500A, a 21-aminosteroid that inhibits iron-dependent lipid peroxidation, was previously shown to have protective effects on neuronal  viability in animal models of ischemic neurologic injury. To test the hypothesis  that lazaroid enhances myocardial salvage after ischemia/reperfusion,  lazaroid-pretreated rats (2 mg/kg intravenously) (n = 26) and control rats  pretreated with vehicle (n = 22) were subjected to 45-min left coronary (LCA)  occlusion followed by 120 min of reflow. Lazaroid-pretreated rats and controls  had similar ischemic risk areas (AR), as determined by phthalocyanine blue dye  staining (47.2 +/- 2.3 vs. 48.2 +/- 3.0%, p = NS, mean +/- SEM). Infarct size,  measured by triphenyltetrazolium staining, was markedly reduced in  lazaroid-treated rats as compared with controls (6.0 +/- 1.5 vs. 22.2 +/- 3.9%, p  = 0.001, infarct size/ischemic RA x 100). There were no differences in systolic  blood pressure (SBP), heart rate (HR), rate-pressure product (RPP), or maximum  rate of left ventricular systolic pressure development (LVdP/dt) between groups  during ischemia or reperfusion. Lazaroid pretreatment enhances myocardial salvage  after 45-min LCA occlusion and 2-h reflow in this animal model. This beneficial  effect is independent of the hemodynamic determinants of myocardial oxygen  demand.

AB  - Endothelial damage is a hallmark of acute lung injury. Endothelial mediators may increase pulmonary vascular tone and induce pulmonary arterial muscularization,  thereby contributing to the pulmonary hypertension seen with acute lung injury.  We measured plasma levels and net pulmonary clearance of endothelin-1, a potent  endothelium-derived vasoconstrictor peptide and smooth muscle mitogen, in 26  patients with early acute lung injury, the adult respiratory distress syndrome,  and pulmonary hypertension. Nineteen had another data collection at clinical  improvement or worsening. Control subjects (n = 25) had no pulmonary hypertension  or lung injury. Initial mixed venous and systemic arterial plasma endothelin-1  levels were elevated (4.6 +/- 0.6 SEM and 4.9 +/- 0.6 pg/ml, respectively) as  compared with control subjects (0.9 +/- 0.1 and 0.6 +/- 0.1 pg/ml). The systemic  arterial/venous endothelin-1 ratio was 1.1 +/- 0.1 (0.7 +/- 0.1 in control  subjects), indicating a reduction in normal net pulmonary endothelin-1 clearance.  With clinical improvement, as compared with clinical worsening, mean plasma  endothelin-1 levels, arterial/venous ratio, and pulmonary arterial pressure fell  significantly towards normal. Thus, patients with acute lung injury have marked  early increases in circulating plasma endothelin-1 levels, associated with  abnormal pulmonary endothelin-1 metabolism. These abnormalities reverse in  patients who recover. Through its actions, endothelin-1 could contribute to the  pulmonary hypertension seen in acute lung injury.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We tested the hypothesis that fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, when administered 10 minutes before the end of 2 hours of reversible middle  cerebral artery occlusion, reduces ischemia-reperfusion injury and infarct volume  measured after a 3-day survival period in rats. METHODS: After 1 hour and 50  minutes of middle cerebral artery occlusion by the intraluminal suture method,  fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, 500 mg/kg in group 1 and 350 mg/kg in group 2 (or an  equivalent volume of 1.8% saline as placebo in each group), was given  intravenously for a period of 15 minutes to fasted adult Sprague-Dawley rats.  After 2 hours of ischemia, the suture was withdrawn and the rats allowed to  survive for 3 days. The areas of infarction in 10 hematoxylin-eosin-stained  coronal sections of the brain were measured and used to calculate infarct volume.  RESULTS: In group 1, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate decreased total cerebral  hemispheric infarct volume by 43% (from 199.6 +/- 11.2 to 114.2 +/- 35.8 mm3, P <  .04; mean +/- SEM). Cerebral cortical and subcortical infarct volumes were  decreased by 46% (from 137.3 +/- 7.5 to 74.1 +/- 28.6 mm3, P < .04) and 36% (from  62.3 +/- 5.1 to 40.0 +/- 8.3 mm3, P < .04), respectively. In group 2,  fructose-1,6-bisphosphate had no effect on infarct volume in rats that developed  mild intraischemic hyperthermia, but in rats kept normothermic during ischemia,  fructose-1,6-bisphosphate reduced subcortical infarct volume from 53.7 +/- 8.1 to  18.4 +/- 8.0 mm3 (P < .03). CONCLUSIONS: Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate improves  functional neurological outcome and reduces infarct volume after reversible  middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats.

AB  - In a variety of recent studies, inhibitors of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis have ameliorated neuronal injury during permanent focal cerebral ischemia, suggesting  that NO may contribute to ischemic damage. In other studies, however, these  inhibitors increased infarct volume during permanent middle cerebral artery  occlusion (MCAO). One complication in these studies was that high-dose NO  synthase inhibitors increased mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) by 20-30 mm Hg.  Thus, it is possible that variations in the effects of NO synthesis inhibitors on  infarct volume could be related to effects of these inhibitors on MAP and  cerebral perfusion during or after ischemia. The present study compared the  effects of control (Ringer's lactate solution) versus low-dose NO inhibition (0.1  mg/kg bolus followed by 0.01 mg/kg/min) on cerebral infarct volume using L-NAME  (NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester) administered during a 1-h baseline period, 3-h  of MCAO, and 2 h of reperfusion in the spontaneously hypertensive rat. Infarct  volume was determined using the TTC (2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride) method  performed 5 h after onset of occlusion. L-NAME reduced infarct volume by 55%. In  the control group (n = 7), infarct volume measured 116 +/- 4 (SEM) mm3 which was  29 +/- 1% of the left hemispheric volume (400.5 +/- 0.3 mm3). In the L-NAME group  (n = 7), infarct volume measured 53 +/- 8 mm3 which was only 13 +/- 2% of the  left hemispheric volume (400.4 +/- 0.5 mm3).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

T2  - The Journal of laboratory and clinical medicine
AB  - Genetic factors have been implicated in the development and progression of glomerulosclerosis and nephron loss in both experimental animals and in humans.  The influence of a differing genetic predisposition to hypertension was examined  in the remnant kidney (RK) model of progressive glomerulosclerosis. Dahl  salt-sensitive (S) and salt-resistant (R) rats fed a normal salt diet underwent  either sham surgery or approximately 5/6 renal ablation and were studied 2 to 3  weeks later. Renal ablation resulted in significantly more severe hypertension in  RK-S rats (205 +/- 6.3 mm Hg, mean +/- SEM) compared with RK-R rats (153 +/- 3.5  mm Hg; p < 0.01). Renal autoregulatory ability, a protective mechanism against  renal transmission of systemic hypertension, was normal in both S and R rats with  intact renal mass. Renal ablation resulted in similar impairments of renal  autoregulatory ability in both strains. However, striking differences in the  severity of renal microvascular and glomerular injury were observed between the  remnant kidneys of S and R rats, paralleling the differences in the severity of  hypertension. The RK-S rats exhibited acute fibrinoid necrosis and thrombosis of  glomerular capillaries, arterioles, and small arteries, whereas only mild  segmental glomerulosclerosis lesions were observed in a small percentage of  glomeruli in the RK-R rats. The intact kidneys of both strains were essentially  free of glomerular or vascular lesions. These data suggest that a genetic  predisposition to hypertension is a major determinant of the severity of  hypertension that follows severe reduction of renal mass and the severity of the  resulting hypertension, in turn, critically influences the severity of glomerular  injury in the RK model.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the pulmonary effects of aspirating a mixture of sucralfate in water and sucralfate in hydrochloric acid in an animal model of aspiration  pneumonia. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, controlled study with repeated  measures. SETTING: University research laboratory. SUBJECTS: Thirty-two in situ,  isolated, blood perfused porcine lung preparations. INTERVENTIONS: Five control  preparations received no aspiration. Twenty-seven preparations received a  standard aspiration of 1.5 mL/kg body of a) distilled water (n = 5), b)  sucralfate in distilled water (n = 8), c) 1/10 normal hydrochloric acid (n = 6),  and d) mixture of sucralfate in distilled water and hydrochloric acid (n = 8).  MEASUREMENTS: The pH measurements were made of all aspirates. Lung weight, airway  pressures, and pulmonary artery pressures were continuously monitored before and  for 4 hrs after aspiration. Lung wet/dry weight ratio was measured at the  completion of the study. RESULTS: The pH of sucralfate mixed with distilled water  was 4.9, pH of 1/10 normal hydrochloric acid was 1.0, and pH of equal volumes of  a sucralfate-water suspension mixed with hydrochloric acid was 1.5. Airway  pressures and pulmonary arterial pressures increased in all aspirate groups over  time compared with those values of control lungs. Control lungs gained 18 +/- 3  (SEM) g over 4 hrs and the wet/dry ratio was 4.951 +/- 0.310. Lungs aspirating  distilled water gained 147 +/- 49 g and the wet/dry ratio was 5.198 +/- 0.120.  Lungs aspirating sucralfate and distilled water increased their weight by 109 +/-  30 g and the wet/dry ratio was 5.380 +/- 0.076. Lungs aspirating a suspension of  sucralfate and water and hydrochloric acid were similar to lungs aspirating  hydrochloric acid alone with weight increases of 265 +/- 30 g and 346 +/- 81 g,  and the wet/dry ratio of 7.011 +/- 0.273 and 7.230 +/- 0.390, respectively.  CONCLUSIONS: Sucralfate has minimal acid buffering effect. Aspiration of  sucralfate mixed with distilled water causes lung edema similar to aspiration of  water alone. Aspiration of a sucralfate-water suspension mixed with hydrochloric  acid causes severe lung edema. These results suggest that patients given  sucralfate prophylaxis for stress ulceration are at risk for acid aspiration.

AB  - In 5 mechanically ventilated patients with severe neurological injury (SNI), we measured the respiratory system's flow resistance (Rrs) over a range of  inspiratory flows between 0.2 to 2 L/s, at inflation volumes (delta V) ranging  from 0.1 to 1 L. Under baseline ventilatory conditions (V = 1 L/s; delta V = 0.95  L), we also partitioned Rrs into airway resistance (Raw) and the additional  resistance offered by the tissues of the lung and chest wall (delta Rrs). At all  inflation volumes, Rrs decreased hyperbolically with increasing flow but was  higher than in normal anesthetized paralyzed subjects (N). At V of 1 L/s and  delta V of 0.5 L, Rrs was significantly greater in SNI than in N (7.7 +/- 1.5 v  4.2 +/- 0.5 cm H2O/L/s; P < .01). This discrepancy was due to higher Raw in SNI.  Indeed, at V of 1 L/s, Raw (mean +/- SEM) was significantly higher in SNI than in  N (4.0 +/- 0.9 v 2.4 +/- 0.2 cm H2O/L/s; P < .001), whereas delta Rrs did not  differ significantly. The increased Raw in SNI was due to the fact that these  patients were therapeutically hyperventilated (PaCO2 = 30.4 +/- 4.2 mm Hg) and as  a result their airways were bronchoconstricted. We conclude that in the intensive  care unit setting, hyperventilated patients with severe neurological injury can  not be considered to be adequate controls in terms of Rrs and Raw, because  hypocapnia induces an increase of Raw and consequently also in Rrs (= Raw+delta  Rrs).

AB  - Release of histamine (H) by ischemia-reperfusion injury was investigated in isolated rat hearts (Langendorff model). The effect of 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40 and  60 min ischemia (n = 10 each) on H in the coronary effluent and in cardiac tissue  was studied after 4 min reperfusion. Release of creatine kinase and lactate  dehydrogenase in the coronary effluent increased with time of ischemia. Tissue H  increased from 95 +/- 10 ng/g rat heart (mean +/- SEM) before ischemia to max 148  +/- 10 ng/g after 20 min ischemia (p < 0.002), and increased also after 15 (p <  0.01), 25 (p < 0.01), and 30 min (p < 0.045). H in the coronary effluent  increased after 15 (from 16 +/- 3 to 26 +/- 2 pmol/min, p < 0.044), 30 (26 +/- 6  pmol/min, p < 0.027), and 60 min ischemia (47 +/- 6 pmol/min, p < 0.0044).  Release of H during ischemia-reperfusion is neither dependent on the severity of  the ischemic insult, nor on the level of tissue H.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aims were to confirm that platelet activating factor is released during reperfusion after global ischaemia in isolated blood perfused rabbit  hearts, and to examine the protective action of TCV-309, a platelet activating  factor antagonist, against reperfusion injury of cardiac muscle. METHODS: The  hearts were mounted on a Langendorff apparatus and perfused with diluted blood  perfusate. After cardiac arrest with St Thomas's cardioplegic solution, the  hearts were subjected to global ischaemia for 120 minutes at 25 degrees C, and  then reperfused for 60 minutes at 37 degrees C. Release of platelet activating  factor into the coronary effluent was quantified by radioimmunoassay. The effect  of TCV-309 on left ventricular function and release of creatine kinase was  measured. RESULTS: A pronounced release of platelet activating factor occurred  after the commencement of reperfusion, although it was not detectable before  induction of ischaemia. Release of platelet activating factor occurred over 60  minutes of the reperfusion period. In the control, left ventricular developed  pressure after 60 minutes of reperfusion recovered to 54.3(SEM 1.7)% (n = 5) of  the preischaemic value. In the hearts treated with TCV-309 at concentrations  above 0.3 microM, recovery of left ventricular developed pressure was  significantly improved (77.6(2.0)% at 1 microM, p < 0.01 v control). Leakage of  creatine kinase during the initial five minutes of reperfusion was significantly  less in the hearts treated with 1 microM TCV-309 than in the controls (5.2(0.4) v  12.2(1.4) IU.g-1 wet weight, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Release of platelet  activating factor occurred during the reperfusion period in Langendorff perfused  hearts. Treatment with the platelet activating factor antagonist TCV-309  significantly improved postischaemic left ventricular function and decreased  creatine kinase release. These results suggest that platelet activating factor is  involved in myocardial injury during ischaemia-reperfusion.

AB  - Tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) is a marker of endothelial cell injury or activation. The release of t-PA from isolated rat hearts (Langendorff model)  subjected to ischemia-reperfusion or reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI)  generated by H2O2 was investigated. H2O2 (200 microM) increased t-PA activity in  the coronary effluent to 305 +/- 84% of initial value (mean +/- SEM, p < 0.04 vs  controls) at the end of a 10 min intervention. The hydroxyl radical scavenger  thiourea (10 mM) only partially inhibited the increase (175 +/- 27%, p < 0.01  compared to controls). 20 min normothermic ischemia increased t-PA activity to  416 +/- 108% (p < 0.005 compared to controls) at the start of reperfusion. In  conclusion, cardiac injury by ischemia-reperfusion or ROI increases release of  t-PA.

AB  - Secretion of immunoreactive atrial natriuretic factors (ANF) after injury by ischaemia-reperfusion and toxic oxygen metabolites (TOM) was investigated in the  following groups of Langendorff-perfused rat hearts: 1.1., control perfusion;  1.2., hearts perfused with H2O2 (200 mumol l-1) as a TOM-generating agent for 10  min, followed by recovery for 30 min; 1.3., thiourea (10 mmol l-1), a hydroxyl  radical scavenger, was given together with H2O2; 2.1., control perfusion; 2.2.,  ischaemia (37 degrees C) for 20 min followed by reperfusion for 40 min.  Ischaemia-reperfusion and TOM temporarily decreased left ventricular developed  pressure and increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. The cardiac  effects of H2O2 were inhibited by thiourea. Coronary flow (CF) was increased by  TOM and decreased by ischaemia-reperfusion. Immunoreactive ANF was measured  sequentially in the coronary effluent by radioimmunoassay. Basal secretion of  immunoreactive ANF for all groups pooled was 0.45 +/- 0.02 pmol min-1 (mean +/-  SEM), and did not change significantly with time in any group. In conclusion,  ischaemia-reperfusion and TOM do not influence secretion of immunoreactive ANF.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The administration of glucose has been shown to worsen brain injury in adult animals but has no effect on the severity of injury in  newborn rats. We wished to see whether the results in newborn rats could be  extended to another newborn animal. METHODS: In 44 0- to 3-day-old piglets,  hypoxic-ischemic central nervous system damage was induced by ligation of both  carotid arteries and reduction of their blood pressure to two-thirds normal for  one-half hour. In the last 15 minutes of this half hour, oxygen concentration was  reduced to 6%. The piglets were randomized to receive either 2 mL/kg 50% dextrose  in water followed by 2 mL/kg per hour for 2.5 hours beginning before ischemia or  enough insulin to reduce their resting blood sugar to approximately 2 mmol/L.  RESULTS: Neurological exam scores in the glucose-treated piglets at 1 day after  injury were significantly worse than those in the insulin-treated group.  Pathological examination scores were poorer in the glucose-treated group (13.6  +/- 1.9 [mean +/- SEM]) than in the insulin-treated group (24.7 +/- 1.4, P <  .01). CONCLUSIONS: Increasing serum glucose during hypoxic-ischemic injury to the  newborn piglet's brain worsens brain injury.

AB  - To elucidate whether activation of intracellular protease causes the contractile dysfunction of post-ischemic reperfused heart (stunned myocardium), the effect of  leupeptin, a cysteine-protease inhibitor, was evaluated in isolated guinea pig  hearts. Left ventricular (LV) isovolumic pressure was measured in hearts  reperfused after global ischemia (15 min, 37 degrees C). Recovery of developed  pressure during reperfusion in hearts treated with 50 microM leupeptin was  significantly greater than that in untreated hearts [94.3 +/- 3.2% of control, n  = 11 (mean +/- SEM] vs. 78.1 +/- 3.1%, n = 14), and was almost identical to that  in nonischemic control (93.5 +/- 1.6%, n = 11). Maximal Ca(2+)-activated  pressure, the intact-heart correlate of maximal Ca(2+)-activated force, was also  evaluated at the end of experiments during tetani elicited by rapid pacing after  exposure to ryanodine. Maximal Ca(2+)-activated pressure in hearts treated with  leupeptin (168 +/- 4.6 mm Hg) was significantly higher than in untreated stunned  hearts (144.5 +/- 5.7 mm Hg), but significantly lower than in nonischemic control  (198.4 +/- 5.5 mm Hg). These results indicate that leupeptin has a protective  effect against myocardial stunning. In coupling with previous reports of  transient increase in intracellular [Ca2+] during ischemia and/or reperfusion,  activation of proteases by Ca2+ overload is suggested to play a significant role  in myocardial stunning.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim was to test whether, besides adenosine A1 receptors, other receptors coupled to the "inhibitory" GTP binding protein Gi confer protection  against ischaemic and reperfusion injury. METHODS: Isolated hearts were  Langendorff perfused at 37 degrees C with blood and were divided into five  groups, all subjected to 45 min zero flow normothermic ischaemia, followed by 1 h  reperfusion. Group 1 consisted of control untreated hearts (n = 5). Group 2  consisted of hearts treated with the muscarinic agonist carbachol (CCh, 10  microM; n = 5). In group 3 (CCh+atropine, n = 5) 5 microM atropine was given as  well as CCh. Groups 1, 2, and 3 were paced at 3 Hz except during ischaemia.  Groups 4 (n = 5) and 5 (n = 6) were similar to groups 1 and 2, except that pacing  was continued throughout ischaemia. RESULTS: In group 1, left ventricular end  diastolic pressure increased during ischaemia, from 7.2(SEM 1.2) mm Hg to 57(5.6)  mm Hg, and remained increased during reperfusion, whereas in group 2, it  increased moderately during ischaemia, from 9.2(0.9) mm Hg to 21.6(4.9) mm Hg and  returned to preischaemic levels during reperfusion. In hearts paced during  ischaemia, contracture developed faster than in unpaced hearts, but CCh still  delayed contracture. Postischaemic recovery of isovolumetric left ventricular  pressure or its first derivative (dP/dt) and reactive hyperaemia were  significantly greater in CCh treated hearts [left ventricular pressure =  69.8(4.9)% of preischaemic value after 60 min reperfusion] than in control hearts  [29.3(6.8)%]. Recovery of left ventricular pressure and dP/dt was worsened by  pacing, but CCh still improved this recovery [left ventricular pressure =  13.1(8.4)% in control, 46.7(5.3)% in CCh treated hearts]. The CCh effect could be  prevented by atropine. ATP breakdown and lactate accumulation during the first  minute of ischaemia were lower in non-paced CCh treated hearts than in controls.  ATP recovered better at the end of reperfusion in both non-paced [7.1(0.72)  mumol.g-1] and paced [4.4(0.77) mumol.g-1] CCh treated hearts, as compared with  non-paced [1.8(0.58) mumol.g-1] and paced [1.2(0.39) mumol.g-1] control hearts.  In paced hearts, less creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase were released in  the CCh treated group throughout the reperfusion phase. CONCLUSIONS: Carbachol  improves functional recovery and confers cellular protection, and this protection  depends mainly but not entirely on its bradycardic effect.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Heat stress, with the expression of heat stress proteins, has been shown to protect the rabbit heart in vitro against global ischaemia/reperfusion  injury, though no benefit is apparent in an in vivo rabbit model of infarct size.  The aim of this study was therefore to investigate this discrepancy and to  discover whether heating itself has any effect which could negate the protection  derived from myocardial stress protein synthesis. METHODS: (1) To ascertain  whether heat stress could limit infarct size in the absence of blood, isolated  buffer perfused hearts, with or without prior heat stress, were subjected to 45  min of regional ischaemia and 120 min reperfusion, and the resulting infarct size  was expressed as a percentage of the risk area (I/R%). (2) The observations were  repeated in an isolated blood perfused heart model in which a support rabbit  (heat stressed or control) was used to perfuse the isolated heart. RESULTS: In  the buffer perfused heart, prior heat stress reduced I/R from 70.8(SEM 4.4)%, n =  10, in controls to 51.5(5.7)%, n = 12 (p < 0.05). In hearts perfused by support  rabbits, prior heat stress reduced I/R [from 34.7(3.7)%, n = 16, to 23.5(3.3)%, n  = 15 (p < 0.05)] only when the perfusing rabbit was a control (not heat  stressed). If the perfusing rabbit had been heated, I/R was greater in both heat  stressed and control hearts [51.9(7.0)% and 44.9(3.3)%, p < 0.05 v control  support rabbit]. CONCLUSIONS: Heat stress limits infarct size in this rabbit  model. However it appears to have additional adverse effects, probably on the  blood, which may override any benefit associated with myocardial stress protein  synthesis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The role of arachidonate lipoxygenase activity in reoxygenation induced cell injury in adult canine cardiac myocytes was investigated. METHODS:  The production of hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs), which are lipoxygenase  metabolites, was measured with high pressure liquid chromatography in canine  cardiac myocytes cultured under hypoxic conditions and then reoxygenated. Free  radical generation was evaluated by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy  with a spin trapper, 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) and luminol enhanced  chemiluminescence emission. Cell injury was estimated in terms of morphological  changes and release of intracellular enzymes. Morphological damage to myocytes  was quantified in terms of the percentage of hypercontracted "round" cells. The  effects of nordihydroguaiaretic acid, AA-861, mepacrine, indomethacin, aspirin,  alpha tocopherol, and 2-0-octadecylascorbic acid (CV-3611) on lipoxygenase  metabolism, free radical generation and cell injury were also assessed. RESULTS:  Cardiac myocytes produced 5-HETE and 12-HETE at less than 0.1 ng.mg-1 protein  under normoxic conditions. Production of HETE was greatly increased at five hours  of reoxygenation after 45 minutes of hypoxia [5-HETE = 12.0(SEM 0.5), 12-HETE =  23.6(1.1) ng.mg-1 protein]. Both DMPO-OH adduct generation and chemiluminescence  emission were considerably increased after one to three hours of reoxygenation,  although they increased only slightly after 45 minutes of hypoxia. After five  hours of reoxygenation, long rod cells gradually became deformed; 92.0% of the  cells were converted to hypercontracted "round" cells. Cell injury and HETE  production were significantly suppressed by nordihydroguaiaretic acid (10  microM), AA-861 (2 microM), and mepacrine (10 microM). Indomethacin (10 microM)  and aspirin (50 microM) enhanced cell injury and HETE production. alpha  Tocopherol and CV-3611 greatly suppressed cell injury and free radical  generation, but not HETE production. CONCLUSION: The arachidonate lipoxygenase  metabolic pathway may have an important role in reoxygenation induced myocardial  cell injury in adult cardiac myocytes, possibly because of the generation of free  radicals.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Postischemic evoked potential recovery correlates with acidosis during ischemia and early reperfusion. Acidosis promotes lipid  peroxidation in vitro. We tested the hypothesis that the 21-aminosteroid  tirilazad mesylate (U74006F), an inhibitor of lipid peroxidation in vitro,  ameliorates somatosensory evoked potential recovery and acidosis during  reperfusion after severe incomplete cerebral ischemia. METHODS: Cerebral  perfusion pressure was reduced to 11 +/- 1 mm Hg (+/- SEM) for 30 minutes by  cerebral ventricular fluid infusion in anesthetized dogs. Cerebral intracellular  pH and high-energy phosphates were measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy.  Dogs were randomized to receive vehicle (citrate buffer; n = 8) or tirilazad (1  mg/kg; n = 8) before ischemia in a blinded study. RESULTS: Cerebral blood flow  was reduced to 6 +/- 1 mL/min per 100 g during ischemia, resulting in nearly  complete loss of high-energy phosphates and an intracellular pH of 6.0-6.1 in  both groups. Initial postischemic hyperemia was similar between groups but lasted  longer in the vehicle group. Tirilazad accelerated mean recovery time of  intracellular pH from 31 +/- 5 to 15 +/- 3 minutes and of inorganic phosphate  from 13 +/- 2 to 6 +/- 1 minutes. Recovery of somatosensory evoked potential  amplitude was greater with tirilazad (49 +/- 3%) than vehicle (33 +/- 6%).  Fractional cortical water content was less with tirilazad (0.819 +/- 0.003) than  vehicle (0.831 +/- 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Tirilazad attenuates cerebral edema and  improves somatosensory evoked potential recovery after incomplete ischemia  associated with severe acidosis. Accelerated pH and inorganic phosphate recovery  indicates that this antioxidant acts during the early minutes of reperfusion.

T2  - Stroke
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Increasing ischemic duration delays recovery of intracellular pH and depresses recovery of somatosensory evoked potentials. We  tested whether manipulation of the rate of pH recovery influences evoked  potential recovery after complete ischemia. METHODS: Four groups of eight  anesthetized dogs underwent 12 minutes of complete ischemia followed by 4 hours  of reperfusion with either 1) normocapnia, 2) normocapnia and acetazolamide (25  mg/kg at reperfusion plus 12.5 mg/kg per hour, 3) hypocapnia, or 4) hypercapnia.  Intracellular pH was measured by phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and  intracellular bicarbonate was calculated using sagittal sinus partial pressure of  CO2 during reperfusion. RESULTS: In the normocapnic control group, intracellular  pH decreased from 7.10 +/- 0.04 (+/- SEM) to 6.13 +/- 0.08 during ischemia and  recovered to 6.90 +/- 0.08 by 30 minutes of reperfusion. Bicarbonate also largely  recovered (9.9 +/- 1.6 mM). With acetazolamide pH (6.51 +/- 0.10) and estimated  bicarbonate (4.8 +/- 1.3 mM) remained depressed at 30 minutes and did not fully  recover until 60-75 minutes. However, percent recovery of somatosensory evoked  potential amplitude at 4 hours of reperfusion was less with acetazolamide (23 +/-  4%) than in the control group (52 +/- 5%). With hypercapnic reperfusion, which  delayed pH recovery but not bicarbonate recovery, evoked potential recovery was  also depressed (27 +/- 5%). With hypocapnic reperfusion, which delayed  bicarbonate recovery but not pH recovery, evoked potential recovery (52 +/- 6%)  was not depressed compared with controls. Recovery of adenosine triphosphate and  oxygen consumption was similar among groups. CONCLUSIONS: Delayed recovery of  intracellular pH with or without delayed recovery of bicarbonate during  reperfusion further impairs somatosensory evoked potential recovery independent  of recovery of high-energy phosphates. Persistence of acidosis during reperfusion  can contribute to postischemic electrophysiological deficit.

AB  - Recent findings indicate that ischemia/reperfusion (IR) is associated with phospholipase C (PLC)-induced inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate production, as well as  abnormal sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ release. Therefore, we hypothesized  that increased SR Ca2+ release may contribute to Ca2+ overload and myocardial  stunning. Neomycin (NEO) was used to inhibit PLC, and sodium dantrolene (DAN) was  used to inhibit myocardial SR Ca2+ release. The purposes of this study were (1)  to determine if PLC inhibition would reduce IR-induced ventricular dysfunction,  (2) to examine ventricular function during inhibition of SR Ca2+ release prior to  ischemia, and (3) to examine the influence of SR Ca2+ release inhibition on  post-IR ventricular function. Left ventricular developed pressure (DP) and +/-  dP/dt of isolated crystalloid perfused rat heart (Langendorff apparatus) paced at  350 bpm were compared before and after global IR (38 degrees C, 20 min I, 40 min  R) to assess functional recovery. PLC was inhibited with NEO (10 microM x 5 min  prior to ischemia), and SR Ca2+ release was retarded with DAN (12.5 microM) in  0.05% DMSO (vehicle) infused for 3 min via the aortic cannula 13 min prior to  ischemia. No effect on DP was observed during NEO or DAN infusion. NEO and DAN  pretreatment each improved recovery of DP (% recovery +/- SEM) following IR:  control, 46.5 +/- 5.1%; NEO + IR, 71.0 +/- 6.3%,* vehicle + IR, 44.4 +/- 2.9%;  DAN + IR, 71.0 +/- 4.7%, *, # (*P < 0.05 vs control IR, #P < 0.05 vs vehicle +  IR, ANOVA, Scheffe F test, n = 5 all groups). We conclude that SR Ca2+ release  during IR contributes to myocardial stunning.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In order to determine whether the relatively high oxygen consumption of stunned myocardium is related to decreased mechanical efficiency, myocardial  oxygen consumption (MVO2) and its major determinants were studied in 10 open  chest anaesthetised pigs. METHODS: According to the time varying elastance  concept, MVO2 is determined by contractility (Emax) and total mechanical work  (PLA), which is the sum of the external work (EW) and potential energy (PE).  Mechanical efficiency (EW/MVO2) equals the product of EW/PLA (= efficiency of  energy transfer or EET) and PLA/MVO2. Emax is the slope of the end systolic  pressure-segment length relationship, determined by gradually clamping the aorta.  PLA is the area enclosed by the end systolic pressure-segment length relationship  and the pressure-segment length trajectory. EW is the area of the  pressure-segment length loop. Systemic haemodynamics, regional segment  shortening, and MVO2 were determined at baseline, during stunning (two sequences  of 10 min occlusion and 30 min of reperfusion), after a subsequent 50 beats.min-1  increase in heart rate by atrial pacing and additional infusion of 2  micrograms.kg-1.min-1 dobutamine. RESULTS: Stunning decreased segment shortening  from 18.2(SEM 1.9)% to 10.2(1.5)%, MVO2 from 4.16(0.27) x 10(-2) to 2.84(0.25) x  10(-2) mumol.beat-1.g-1, and Emax from 47(9) to 23(3) mm Hg.mm-1 (all p < 0.05).  PLA decreased by 13(4)%, as EW decreased by 42(6)%, and PE tended to increase.  Although EET decreased from 0.58(0.04) to 0.40(0.03) (p < 0.05), there was no  decrease in the mechanical efficiency, as an increase in PE caused an increase in  PLA/MVO2 which compensated for the decrease in EET. Dobutamine infusion increased  Emax and EW per beat to 120(23)% and 67(8)% of baseline, respectively, while MVO2  [4.12(0.53) mumol.beat-1.g-1] and EET [0.57(0.04)] returned to baseline.  CONCLUSIONS: In stunned myocardium, mechanical efficiency is not decreased  despite a decrease in EET. The increase in EET after dobutamine may explain the  lack of the excessive increase in MVO2.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim was to determine if the beneficial effects of preconditioning would be affected by inhibiting ATP sensitive potassium (KATP) channels in the  isolated, perfused rat heart. METHODS: The effects of inhibiting KATP channels  with glibenclamide (10 microM) were evaluated on ionic alterations and recovery  of function after 30 min ischaemia in non-preconditioned hearts and in hearts  that had been preconditioned with four intermittent periods of 5 min ischaemia  each separated by 5 min of reflow. [Ca2+]i, pHi, and high energy phosphate levels  were measured using 19F and 31P nuclear magnetic resonance during the  preconditioning periods of ischaemia, during 30 min of ischaemia, and during  reflow, in the presence and absence of 10 microM glibenclamide. RESULTS: High  energy phosphate contents were decreased during the preconditioning period to a  greater extent in glibenclamide treated hearts and the onset of contracture was  hastened during the subsequent 30 min period of sustained ischaemia. However,  glibenclamide (10 microM) did not abolish the protective effects of  preconditioning on ion accumulation during ischaemia or on postischaemic recovery  of contractile function. Recovery of left ventricular developed pressure (as % of  initial value) following 30 min of ischaemia was 74(SEM 5)% in the preconditioned  hearts without drug and 62(4)% in the preconditioned hearts with glibenclamide,  while recovery was 25(5)% in the non-preconditioned hearts without drug and  19(2)% in the non-preconditioned hearts with drug. The alterations in [Ca2+]i and  pHi during ischaemia were similar in the glibenclamide treated and untreated  preconditioned hearts and in both cases were less marked than in the  non-preconditioned untreated hearts. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, although inhibition of  KATP channels accelerates high energy phosphate depletion during the  preconditioning period, this does not result in accentuation of the ionic  derangements during a subsequent sustained period of ischaemia and does not  abolish the protective effect of preconditioning on stunning in the isolated rat  heart.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Rapid pacing has been shown to precondition the dog heart against ischaemic dysrhythmia. The aim of this study was to determine whether rapid  pacing could also limit infarct size. METHODS: Rabbits (n = 5) were rapidly paced  via the left atrium at 420-480 beats.min-1. Five min of rapid pacing and 10 min  of recovery in sinus rhythm were followed by 45 min of regional ischaemia and 120  min of reperfusion. Control rabbits (n = 9) were treated identically without  prior rapid pacing. Infarct size was determined in both groups using tetrazolium  and expressed as a percentage of the area at risk demarcated by fluorescent  microspheres. In a separate series of experiments, rapidly paced Langendorff  perfused rabbit hearts (n = 9) were used to determine coronary flow under  perfusion conditions designed to simulate the in vivo situation during rapid  pacing. RESULTS: Rapid pacing caused a fall in systolic pressure from 91.4(SEM  4.5) to 47.0(5.9) mm Hg (p < 0.01) and diastolic pressure from 67.2(2.9) to  23.6(3.2) mm Hg (p < 0.01). Both recovered within 30 s of cessation of pacing.  During rapid pacing the action potential duration shortened from 192(13) to  128(5) ms (p = 0.01) and developed electrical alternans (n = 4). Following rapid  pacing the ECG showed either ST depression or T wave inversion (n = 4). Despite  these profound changes, rapid pacing did not reduce infarct size v control  [52.7(4.6)% v 60.8(9.1)% of the area at risk, respectively]. The in vitro  experiments estimated that rapid pacing would result in a reduction in coronary  flow to 44% of that in sinus rhythm without a significant rise in lactate efflux.  CONCLUSIONS: In our model, pretreatment with rapid pacing fails to reduce infarct  size. The most likely reason for this is that rapid pacing at a rate of 480  beats.min-1 does not cause myocardial ischaemia of sufficient severity to trigger  the preconditioning response.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have shown that cardiac protection by ischaemic preconditioning wanes before contractile function recovers; thus stunning is  insufficient to cause preconditioning. To test whether reduced contractile effort  is necessary for preconditioning induced protection, the effect on myocardial  infarct size of restoring contractile function with dobutamine was examined in  preconditioned and control dogs. METHODS: In two experimental groups (groups P  and P+D), preconditioning was produced by four 5 min occlusions of the left  anterior descending coronary artery, each separated by 5 min of reperfusion.  Contractile function was assessed by sonomicrometry 5 min after completion of the  preconditioning protocol. In group P+D, dobutamine (average dose = 5  micrograms.kg-1.min-1) was then infused intravenously to restore systolic  shortening to baseline. The artery then was reoccluded for 40 min of sustained  ischaemia followed by 4 d of reperfusion. Two additional groups of  non-preconditioned control dogs (groups C and C+D) also underwent 40 min of  coronary occlusion and 4 d of reperfusion. Group C+D received a dobutamine  infusion beginning 15 min before and during the 40 min occlusion to match the  dobutamine received in group P+D, whereas group C received normal saline.  RESULTS: Preconditioning caused mild postischaemic contractile dysfunction (50%  decrease in systolic shortening) which was easily reversed by dobutamine  treatment. Dobutamine also increased both the rate-pressure product and the left  ventricular dP/dt in both treated groups (C+D and P+D). Histological infarct size  was 12.3(SEM 2.0)% of the area at risk in the untreated control group (n = 11),  and was reduced to 4.4(1.7)% in the untreated preconditioning group (n = 8; p <  0.05). Dobutamine increased non-preconditioned infarct size (group C+D) to  22.1(3.4)% (n = 7; p < 0.05). Infarct size in the dobutamine treated  preconditioning group (P+D) was not significantly different from infarct size in  group P (n = 8), at 6.1(2.5%). CONCLUSIONS: In preconditioned hearts, dobutamine  restored postischaemic contractile function but did not increase infarct size  significantly. Thus reduced contractile effort is not required for the  cardioprotective effect on ischaemic preconditioning.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim was to define the relation between transcardiac changes in neutrophil function in myocardial ischaemia and the progression of myocardial  necrosis. METHODS: Samples of blood from carotid artery, jugular vein, and  cardiac vein streaming from the ischaemic area were taken simultaneously in a  canine coronary occlusion-reperfusion model of myocardial infarction. Neutrophil  function was evaluated by neutrophil count, whole blood chemiluminescence and  leucocyte infiltration into the ischaemic myocardium. Myocardial necrosis was  assessed by plasma creatine kinase and dual staining technique using Evans blue  dye and triphenyltetrazolium chloride. Effects of a free radical scavenger,  N-2-mercaptopropionyl glycine (MPG), initiated 15 min before reperfusion and  continued during the reperfusion phase, were also examined. RESULTS: Whole blood  chemiluminescence of the cardiac vein was reduced at 90 min after coronary artery  occlusion as compared to carotid artery [5.8(SEM 0.5) v 7.5(0.7) count x 10(3)  cell neutrophil-1 x 10 min-1, p < 0.05], and then increased abruptly after  reperfusion to peak after 10 min of reperfusion [7.1(0.7) count x 10(3) cell  neutrophil-1 x 10 min-1]. The neutrophil count in cardiac venous blood was  significantly reduced within 5 min of reperfusion. MPG significantly attenuated  the reperfusion associated increase in cardiac vein whole blood chemiluminescence  and the decrease in the cardiac venous blood neutrophil count. The increase in  myocardial free radical generation 1-3 h after reperfusion, as assessed by the  electron paramagnetic resonance spin trapping technique, was reduced markedly, as  was the extent of leucocyte infiltration into the ischaemic myocardium. Under  these conditions, administration of MPG significantly reduced myocardial infarct  size [40.3(4.5)% v 21.4(4.2)%, p < 0.05]. A marked increase in transcardiac  creatine kinase release after reperfusion observed in control dogs was also  reduced significantly. CONCLUSIONS: A transient alteration of neutrophil function  occurs in the coronary circulation immediately after reperfusion, which may  augment neutrophil infiltration and free radical generation in the ischaemic  myocardium, leading to the propagation of myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion  injury.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: the vascular endothelium serves as a functional barrier between the circulating blood and the vessel wall. It is an essential element for the  maintenance of vascular homeostasis and is implicated in the pathogenesis of  vascular disease. Reversed vein bypass grafting is considered to be a devastating  procedure for the endothelial cell layer of the graft during the first 7 days. At  this time, smooth muscle cell proliferation, the forerunner of intimal  hyperplasia, begins. Loss of endothelial cell integrity is cited as an important  factor in this smooth muscle cell response. The integrity of the vein graft  endothelial lining after grafting was examined in this study. METHODS: reversed  vein bypass grafting of the common carotid artery using external jugular vein was  performed in 24 New Zealand white rabbits. All grafts were pressure fixed (80  mmHg) in situ, at 0 and 10 min, 6 h and 1, 3, 5, 7 and 14 days postoperatively.  The endothelial cell layer was examined by light microscopy (LM), scanning (SEM)  and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and immunohistochemistry (Factor VIII)  using standard histological procedures. RESULTS: the endothelium was observed by  SEM and confirmed by both LM, Factor VIII and TEM in all specimens. It covered  almost the entire surface examined. At 0 and 10 min, endothelial cells were  present and displayed minimal evidence of injury. At 6 h and 1 day, numerous red  cells, polymorphonucleocytes (PMNs), platelets and fibrin were adherent to the  luminal surface. Blood cells were also seen beneath the endothelium. At day 3,  the adherent fibrin and cellular elements were reduced with most of the  endothelial lining intact. Within 10 min, TEM demonstrated that these cells were  stretched, very thin with few microvesicles and a blurred cytoplasm, which would  indicate viability but a degree of cellular injury. By day 1, the endothelial  cells were lifted from their underlying structures by subendothelial oedema and  an infiltrate predominantly of PMNs. By day 5, the blood cells and fibrin which  were adherent to the endothelium had been dispersed and the subendothelial  infiltrate was to a large extent replaced by disintegrated PMNs. On days 7 and  14, a viable confluent endothelial cell layer was present and a degree of intimal  hyperplasia was noted. The endothelial cells appeared to have enlarged nucleoli  and cytoplasms filled with a considerable quantity of rough endoplasmic  reticulum. CONCLUSION: the endothelium of reversed vein grafts is preserved at  the time of implantation and at all time intervals studied in this model. These  findings do not support the assumption that endothelial denudation is a  prerequisite for intimal hyperplasia. Endothelial cell dysfunction and  morphological changes are maximal within the first 3 days after grafting but  appear to recover by the 5th postoperative day. The gross preservation of the  endothelial cell layer implies that therapeutic approaches, to mitigate  endothelial cell injury and its consequences, should be focused on the  preoperative period and the first 5 days following implantation.

AB  - Random stool samples were obtained from 14 ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) patients 43 +/- 5 (mean +/- SEM) months after surgery, and the concentrations of  individual short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were determined by gas liquid  chromatography. Stool frequency was determined from a diary recorded for 15 days  prior to stool sampling. The frequency, amplitude, and duration of phasic  contractions (PCs) within the pouch following infusion of a physiologic  concentration of SCFAs and normal saline randomly into the pouch of six IPAA  patients were determined manometrically. The mean total SCFA concentration after  IPAA did not differ significantly from normal stools (83 +/- 20 mM after IPAA vs.  97 +/- 10 mM for controls; P > 0.05). In the IPAA patients, regression analysis  demonstrated an inverse relationship between stools per day and total SCFA  concentration (r = 0.73; P < 0.001). Moreover, no change in frequency (3.0 +/-  0.9 vs. 3.2 +/- 0.8 PCs/30 minutes), amplitude (26 +/- 5 vs. 25 +/- 4 mmHg), or  duration (23 +/- 3 vs. 26 +/- 2 seconds) of PCs was found after SCFA infusion  compared with saline control (P > 0.1). These findings demonstrate that SCFAs are  present in ileal pouch effluent and that stool frequency may be related to fecal  SCFA concentration. Also, the normal contractile response of the terminal ileum  to SCFAs does not occur in the ileal pouch.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The ability of R75231, a nucleoside transport inhibitor, to influence adenine nucleotide metabolism and enhance postischaemic functional recovery was  assessed in the blood perfused rabbit heart. METHODS: Hearts (n = 8 per group)  from donor animals were excised and perfused with blood at 37 degrees C from a  support rabbit. After 20 min of aerobic perfusion hearts were arrested with St  Thomas' Hospital cardioplegic solution (2 min at 37 degrees C) and rendered  globally ischaemic for 60 min. This was followed by 60 min of reperfusion. R75231  (0.1 mg.kg-1, intravenously) was given to donor and support rabbits 1 h before  the experiment, control rabbits receiving the same volume of vehicle. RESULTS:  Treatment with R75231 resulted in a 45% reduction in coronary vascular resistance  in aerobically perfused control hearts, an effect that was absent during  postischaemic reperfusion. Thus, before ischaemia, coronary flow was greater in  R75231 treated hearts [6.6(SEM 0.8) ml.min-1] than in controls [4.3(0.6)  ml.min-1; p < 0.05] but during reperfusion no significant difference was observed  [4.0(0.6) v 3.6(0.3) ml.min-1]. The mean time to onset and extent of contracture  during ischaemia was similar in R75231 treated and control groups, at 42(4) v  41(4) min and 27(3) v 26(6) mm Hg, respectively. Left ventricular developed  pressure recovered to approximately 50% of its preischaemic value during the  first 40 min of reperfusion in both groups; however, after longer durations of  reperfusion, it tended to deteriorate in the R75231 treated group whereas it was  maintained at a constant level in the controls [37(10) v 53(6) mm Hg,  respectively; NS]. At the end of reperfusion, tissue adenosine content was  13-fold greater in the R75231 treated group, at 0.40(0.09) v 0.03(0.01) mumol.g-1  dry wt in controls; p < 0.05; the nucleotide pool, nicotinamide adenine  dinucleotide phosphate content, and the energy charge potential were similar in  groups. CONCLUSIONS: R75231 decreased coronary vascular resistance and increased  coronary flow during aerobic perfusion in control hearts, an effect that was lost  after ischaemia and reperfusion. R75231 also increased greatly the tissue content  of adenosine but, despite this, failed to improve either the recovery of cardiac  contractile function or the replenishment of the adenine nucleotide pool.

AB  - Functional abdominal pain--that is, pain without demonstrable organic abnormalities--has often been associated with psychologic stress. The aim of the  present study was to investigate whether sympathetic nervous system response to  laboratory stress and basal parasympathetic neural activity were disturbed in 22  patients with functional abdominal pain (functional group) as compared with 14  healthy controls (healthy group) and 26 patients with organic abdominal pain  (organic group) due to duodenal ulcer (DU), gallstones, or urinary tract calculi.  Plasma adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) and serum cortisol measurements were  included, to assess the pituitary-adrenocortical axis. Heart rate, systolic blood  pressure, and plasma adrenaline increased significantly in all groups in response  to a stress test (mental arithmetic). Plasma noradrenaline increased in the DU  patients only, and plasma ACTH and serum cortisol did not increase at all in any  of the groups. As a measure of parasympathetic neural activity, independent of  sympathetic neural activity, the beat-to-beat variation of the heart rate was  calculated. The functional patients had a significantly higher beat-to-beat  variation expressed as the mean square successive differences of the R-R  intervals (MSSD), indicating a higher basal parasympathetic neural activity (mean  MSSD +/- SEM = 64 +/- 6 msec in the functional group, 46 +/- 6 msec in the  healthy group, and 49 +/- 6 msec in the organic group; P = 0.03). A reduced  sympathetic neural response as indicated by a lesser stress-induced increment in  heart rate, was seen in both patient groups (functional, 13 +/- 2 beats/min;  organic, 10 +/- 2 beats/min) as compared with the healthy group (19 +/- 2  beats/min; P = 0.003).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - Moderate hypothermia has been shown to have therapeutic utility in the treatment of cerebral ischemia and to attenuate the rise in interstitial concentrations of  the excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter L-glutamate. In this study, the  influence of hypothermia on traumatic brain injury (TBI) was assessed using a  controlled cortical impact model. Rats were cooled to 32.0-33.0 degrees C at  least 30 min before injury and maintained at this temperature for 2 h after  injury. The influence of hypothermia on the immediate increase in interstitial  concentrations of aspartate and glutamate and the volume of the resultant lesion  14 days after TBI was then determined. The volume of the lesion (mean +/- SEM) in  hypothermic animals (8.2 +/- 1.3 mm3, n = 9) was significantly smaller than that  of normothermic animals (13.2 +/- 1.7 mm3, n = 8). By contrast, TBI-induced  increases in dialysate concentrations of aspartate and glutamate were similar at  the two temperatures. Thus, aspartate content (nmol/10 min) in animals maintained  at 37.0-37.5 degrees C (n = 6) and 32.0-33.0 degrees C (n = 6) increased from  respective mean preinjury values of 0.05 +/- 0.02 and 0.08 +/- 0.02 to much  larger peak values (0.78 +/- 0.13 and 0.71 +/- 0.09, respectively). Similarly,  under normothermic conditions glutamate content (nmol/10 min) increased from 0.13  +/- 0.03 to 3.08 +/- 0.52 and from 0.19 +/- 0.06 to a peak value of 3.09 +/- 0.26  under hypothermic conditions. These data clearly demonstrate the cytoprotective  action of moderate hypothermia and further suggest that this action is not  mediated by attenuation of the rise in interstitial concentrations of aspartate  and glutamate.

AU  - Papa, L. A.
T2  - Cardiovascular research
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim was to investigate the role of peptide leukotrienes in the pathophysiology of myocardial injury during reperfusion of previously ischaemic  myocardium. METHODS: Adult male cats (2.9-5.4 kg) were subjected to left anterior  descending coronary artery occlusion for 3 h followed by 3 h of reperfusion. The  peptide leukotriene receptor antagonist, LY-171883, was given intravenously only  during the reperfusion period (3 mg.kg-1 bolus; 3 mg.kg-1 x h-1 infusion).  Ischaemic injury was assessed by nitroblue tetrazolium staining and tissue  creatine kinase activity; neutrophil infiltration was determined by  myeloperoxidase activity of myocardial homogenates. RESULTS: There was no  significant difference at any time point in the experimental protocol between  mean arterial blood pressure or pressure-rate index in cats given LY-171883 (3  mg.kg-1) and cats given vehicle. The area at risk of infarction (AAR) was 24(SEM  2)% for vehicle treated cats and 22(2)% for the drug treated cats. The necrotic  area was 48(5)% of the AAR for the vehicle group but only 29(5)% of the AAR for  the group given LY-171883 (p < 0.02). Left ventricular maximum +dP/dt tended to  be higher with drug treatment compared to vehicle at the end of the reperfusion  period. Tissue from the area at risk was assayed for creatine kinase activity and  neutrophil specific myeloperoxidase activity as an index of the accumulation of  neutrophils in this region. Creatine kinase activity was significantly higher (p  < 0.05) in the AAR for drug nu vehicle treated cats following reperfusion,  confirming the histochemical analysis. Myeloperoxidase activity increased  approximately 12-fold in the AAR of cats receiving vehicle. LY-171883 did not  reduce the myeloperoxidase activity significantly in the area at risk.  CONCLUSIONS: LY-171883 has a protective effect in ischaemia-reperfusion injury to  the myocardium. These findings suggest a role for peptide leukotrienes both in  the extension of ischaemic damage and in post-ischaemic ventricular dysfunction  during reperfusion.

T2  - Circulation
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prior studies have shown that leukocytes are important in reperfusion injury after normothermic ischemia, and recently discovered leukocyte adhesion  molecules that bind to endothelial ligands may be involved in this process. No  studies on the role of leukocyte adhesion molecules in hypothermic ischemia are  available. METHODS AND RESULTS: We assessed the effect of preischemic  administration of monoclonal antibody to the leukocyte adhesion molecule CD18 on  recovery of isolated blood-perfused neonatal lamb hearts arrested for 2 hours  with 15 degrees C K+ cardioplegic solution by comparing nine antibody-treated and  nine control hearts. At 30 minutes after reperfusion, antibody-treated hearts  compared with control hearts had better percent recovery of maximum left  ventricular (LV) developed pressure (83.9 +/- 2.2% versus 73.6 +/- 3.0%, mean +/-  SEM), LV dP/dt (78.4 +/- 3.3% versus 67.4 +/- 3.4%), coronary blood flow (159.5  +/- 12.2% versus 84.4 +/- 3.5%), and myocardial oxygen consumption (129.8 +/-  16.5% versus 71.2 +/- 6.2%) (all p < 0.05). In each heart, we also tested  coronary vascular resistance (CVR) response to 10(-6) mol/l acetylcholine (ACh)  infusion to assess endothelial function. Percent recovery of CVR response to ACh  was higher in antibody-treated hearts (38.4 +/- 4.3%) than control hearts (13.4  +/- 12.8%) (p = 0.08). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that leukocyte  adherence to endothelium mediated by CD18 plays an important role in reperfusion  after hypothermic ischemia. Antibody to CD18 may be useful in myocardial and  endothelial protection during surgically induced ischemia.

AB  - As part of a study on the effects of acute ozone stress on the lung surfactant system, we correlated morphometric, biochemical, and functional indices of lung  injury using male rats exposed to 3 ppm ozone for 1, 2, 4, and 8 hr. Evaluation  of lung mechanics, using the Pulmonary Evaluation and Diagnostic Laboratory  System, revealed a significant decrease in dynamic lung compliance (ml/cmH2O/kg)  from a control value of 0.84 +/- 0.02 (SEM) to 0.72 +/- 0.04 and 0.57 +/- 0.06 at  4 and 8 hr, respectively. At 2 hr there was a transient increase in PaO2 to 116  torr (control = 92 torr) followed by a decrease at 4 hr (65 torr) and 8 hr (55  torr). Morphometry of lung tissue, fixed by perfusion of fixative via the  pulmonary artery at 12 cm H2O airway distending pressure, demonstrated an  increase in the area of the intravascular compartment at 8 hr, in association  with a 65 and 39% replacement of the alveolar area by fluid in ventral and dorsal  lung regions, respectively. There was a positive correlation (r = 0.966) between  alveolar edema and transudated proteins in lavage fluid. A stepwise multiple  regression model, with edema as the dependent variable, suggested that pulmonary  vasodilatation, hypoxemia, and depletion of surfactant tubular myelin in lavage  fluid were indices for predicting alveolar edema. In a second model, with lavage  protein concentration as the dependent variable, decreasing dynamic compliance  and hypoxemia were predictors of progressive, intraalveolar transudation of  plasma proteins. The above structural-functional relationships support the  concept that ozone-induced high-protein alveolar edema is pathogenetically linked  to pulmonary hyperemia, deficiency of surfactant tubular myelin, and associated  lung dysfunctions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate the effect of aging on myocardial ischemic and reperfusion injury, cytosolic calcium (Ca2+), intracellular pH (pHi), and  mechanical performance were measured in isolated perfused rabbit hearts. METHODS  AND RESULTS: Hearts of mature (4-5-month-old) and aged (28-38-month-old) rabbits  were loaded with 10 microM of fura-2 or  2',7'-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) and subjected to 30  minutes of normothermic ischemia and reperfusion. Cytosolic Ca2+ levels ([Ca2+])  during the nonbeating ischemic period and end-diastolic Ca2+ levels ([EDCa2+])  during reperfusion were determined from the fura-2 fluorescence ratio of emission  at 510 nm during excitation at 340 and 380 nm. pHi was obtained from the ratio of  emission at 530 nm during excitation at 450 and 490 nm. [Ca2+] of the mature  group (n = 8) increased from 188 +/- 19 nM (mean +/- SEM) to 373 +/- 32 nM during  ischemia, and that of the aged group (n = 7) increased from 242 +/- 17 to 465 +/-  20 nM. The rise of [Ca2+] of the aged group was significantly greater (p < 0.05)  than that of the mature group. Immediately after reperfusion, [EDCa2+] in both  groups returned to the preischemic level. pHi decreased to the same extent (from  7.2 to 6.7) during ischemia and returned to preischemic values during  reperfusion. The mature group recovered 84 +/- 3% of left ventricular peak  pressure after ischemia, whereas the aged group recovered only 55 +/- 3% (p <  0.005). Functional recovery was inversely correlated to the increase of [Ca2+]  during ischemia (r = 0.66). CONCLUSIONS: Aged hearts exhibit greater accumulation  of [Ca2+] during ischemia and less functional recovery after ischemia than mature  hearts. The greater rise of [Ca2+] in aged hearts is not a result of the  difference of buffering capacity for ischemia-induced acidosis.

T2  - Cardiovascular research
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The opening of potassium (K+) channels during regional ischaemia may, by inducing rapid contractile arrest, be an intrinsic energy sparing mechanism.  Thus K+ channel openers (for example, lemakalim) exert significant anti-ischaemic  effects, whereas glibenclamide exacerbates ischaemic contracture and limits  postischaemic functional recovery. The aim of the study was to investigate the  ability of these compounds to influence ischaemic injury when used either alone  or in combination with rapid arrest induced by a high K+ cardioplegic solution.  METHODS: Contractile function of isolated Langendorff perfused rat hearts was  assessed using an intraventricular balloon. Hearts were subjected to normothermic  global ischaemia (20 min) or cardioplegic arrest (35 min) with and without  glibenclamide or lemakalim. Lemakalim (10 mumol.litre-1) or glibenclamide (10  mumol.litre-1) was given, in the presence or absence of cardioplegia, for 2 min  immediately prior to the onset of ischaemia. The rate of ischaemia induced  contractile failure, the severity of ischaemic contracture, and the degree of  postischaemic functional recovery were all measured. RESULTS: In the absence of  cardioplegia, the time to contractile arrest in control hearts was 133 (SEM 4) s.  This was increased by glibenclamide, to 145(6) s, and decreased by lemakalim, to  112(6) s. The time to onset of ischaemic contracture [8(1) min] was accelerated  by glibenclamide [4(1) min] and delayed by lemakalim [14(1) min]. Lemakalim  significantly improved the recovery of left ventricular developed pressure from  49(7)% in control hearts to 65(3)%, and left ventricular end diastolic pressure  from 41(3) to 21(4) mm Hg. Hearts pretreated with glibenclamide showed similar  recoveries to control hearts. During reperfusion, lemakalim exerted a transient  vasodilator effect whereas glibenclamide caused a transient vasoconstriction.  When either glibenclamide or lemakalim was added to a high K+ cardioplegic  solution and hearts rendered ischaemic for 35 min, the ability of both compounds  to influence ischaemic contracture and postischaemic functional recovery was  lost. In additional studies the effect of lemakalim on the relative times to  ischaemia induced mechanical failure and electrical arrest was assessed. In  control hearts the time to contractile failure was 128(5) s and the time to  electrical arrest was 241(30) s, while in the lemakalim treated hearts the values  were 103(2) s and 509(161) s, respectively. In the lemakalim group all the hearts  showed sustained ventricular arrhythmias; in the control group there were no  arrhythmias. CONCLUSIONS: Lemakalim can exert a significant anti-ischaemic effect  when given alone. This effect is lost when it is used in combination with high K+  cardioplegia. The anti-ischaemic properties of lemakalim may thus be limited to  its ability to accelerate contractile arrest.

AB  - The normal microvascular permeability of the ascending colon in horses and the microvascular permeability of that segment after ischemia and reperfusion were  investigated. Microvascular permeability was estimated by the ratio of lymphatic  protein to plasma protein concentration (Cl/Cp) at high lymph flow rates in 8  adult horses in 2 equal groups: normal and ischemic (2-hour period). Lymphatic  flow rates and lymph and plasma protein concentrations were determined.  Intestinal biopsy specimens were obtained at the end of each experiment. Flow  independent values were selected and compared by one-way ANOVA, and the mean and  SEM of these values were determined. The mean Cl/Cp ratios for the flow  independent part of each data set were as follows: normal = 0.36 +/- 0.08;  ischemic = 0.70 +/- 0.08. These groups were significantly different (P < or =  0.0001). Microscopic evaluation revealed mild congestion and edema in the normal  group. The ischemic group had mild to moderate mucosal degeneration, with  moderate to severe congestion and edema. We concluded that ischemia of the  ascending colon, when followed by reperfusion, results in a significant increase  in microvascular permeability.

AU  - Browne, E. E.
AU  - Pugsley, W. B.
T2  - Cardiovascular research
AB  - OBJECTIVE: One of the mechanisms by which ischaemic preconditioning is thought to protect against later prolonged ischaemia is via a reduction in ATP utilisation  during ischaemia. The ATP "wastage" that occurs during ischaemia is thought to be  due to mitochondrial ATPase activity, which may be prevented in ischaemic  preconditioning by the binding of a specific inhibitor protein. As the rat is  known to have less inhibitor protein than other species, this study was designed  to determine whether the rat heart could be ischaemically preconditioned.  METHODS: Rats were anaesthetised with pentobarbitone, the chest opened and the  hearts ischaemically preconditioned with a 5 min occlusion of the left main  coronary artery followed by 10 min reperfusion. The hearts were then subjected to  a 45 min occlusion followed by 3 h reperfusion. Control hearts were treated  identically but without ischaemic preconditioning. Infarct size was measured  using triphenyl tetrazolium and expressed as a percentage of the region at risk,  measured with fluorescent particles. RESULTS: Infarct size as a percent of the  risk area in the ischaemically preconditioned group (n = 8) was 31.4(SEM 6.1)%,  versus 61.0(4.8)% in control hearts (n = 8) (p < 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: These  results show that rat hearts can be ischaemically preconditioned and suggest that  the protective mechanism involved in this phenomenon is not mediated through the  endogenous inhibition of mitochondrial ATPase. An overall reduction in  mitochondrial ATP "wastage" may not be the sole mechanism in the protection seen  in ischaemic preconditioning.

AB  - We prospectively tested the effect of the early postinjury attainment of supranormal values of cardiac index (> or = 4.52 L/min per square meter), oxygen  delivery (> or = 670 mL/min per square meter), and oxygen consumption (> or = 166  mL/min per square meter) on outcome in traumatized patients with an estimated  blood loss of 2000 mL or more. The goals in control patients were to attain  normal values for all hemodynamic measurements. During the 6-month period, 33  protocol patients and 34 control patients with similar vital signs, estimated  blood losses, and severity of injuries were enrolled in the study. Eight (24%)  protocol patients died, while 15 (44%) control patients died. The protocol  patients had fewer mean (+/- SEM) organ failures per patient (0.76 +/- 1.21 vs  1.59 +/- 1.60), shorter stays in the intensive care unit (5 +/- 3 vs 12 +/- 12),  and fewer mean days requiring ventilation (4 +/- 3 vs 11 +/- 10) than did the  control patients (P < .05 for each). We conclude that attaining supranormal  circulatory values improves survival and decreases morbidity in the severely  traumatized patient.

AB  - Cyclosporine (CYA) reduces the renal synthesis of prostaglandins of the E series (PGE). Analogue of PGE1 have been shown to mitigate the vasoconstriction and  abnormal renal function of experimental acute CYA nephrotoxicity. We examined the  hypothesis that the orally bioavailable PGE analogue enisoprost (EP) would  improve renal function in renal transplant recipients chronically exposed to CYA.  In a randomized double-blind study, 40 patients at two centers who were being  monitored for 3 to 30 months after renal transplantation, were allocated to  receive either EP 100 micrograms orally four times daily or placebo (P) for 2  weeks. CYA dosing was fixed at existing levels. There could be no evidence of  concurrent acute renal injury, including that of acute rejection. Glomerular  filtration rate (GFR) was measured by the clearance of radiolabeled DTPA, while  effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) was measured as the clearance of  p-aminohippuric acid (PAH). The acute effects of EP were examined twice, by  comparing immediate postdose to predose values for GFR and ERPF on day 1 and  again on day 14. Chronic effects were examined by comparing baseline (predose)  values only for GFR and ERPF between days 1 and 14 and by an examination of  creatinine clearances (CCR) on days 0, 14, and 21. At enrollment, patients were  well matched for renal function (CCR:EP 47 +/- 5 v P 49 +/- 4 mL/min/1.73 m2; P =  NS). Baseline demographics were similar, although patients treated with EP were  older (46 +/- 2 v 36 +/- 3 years, mean +/- SEM, P = 0.003). CYA doses and blood  levels did not change significantly.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Tirilazad mesylate (U74006F) has been reported to improve recovery following cerebral ischemia. We conducted a randomized blinded study to  determine if the drug would improve immediate metabolic recovery after complete  cerebral compression ischemia. METHODS: Mongrel dogs were anesthetized with  pentobarbital and fentanyl and treated with either vehicle (citrate buffer, n =  8) or tirilazad (1.5 mg/kg i.v. plus 0.18 mg/kg/hr, n = 8). Normothermic complete  cerebral compression ischemia was produced for 12 minutes by lateral ventricular  fluid infusion to raise intracranial pressure above systolic arterial pressure.  Cerebral high-energy phosphate concentrations and intracellular pH were measured  by phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Cerebral blood flow was measured  with radiolabeled microspheres, and oxygen consumption was calculated from  sagittal sinus blood samples. Somatosensory evoked potentials were measured  throughout the experiment. RESULTS: During ischemia, both groups demonstrated  complete loss of high-energy phosphates and a fall in intracellular pH (vehicle,  5.76 +/- 0.23; tirilazad, 5.79 +/- 0.26; mean +/- SEM). At 180 minutes of  reperfusion, there were no differences between groups in recovery of  intracellular pH (vehicle, 6.89 +/- 0.07; tirilazad, 6.88 +/- 0.18),  phosphocreatine concentration (vehicle, 89 +/- 16%; tirilazad, 94 +/- 24% of  baseline value), oxygen consumption (vehicle, 2.6 +/- 0.2 ml/min/100 g;  tirilazad, 1.8 +/- 0.5 ml/min/100 g), or somatosensory evoked potential amplitude  (vehicle, 11 +/- 6%; tirilazad, 7 +/- 4% of baseline value). Forebrain blood flow  fell below baseline levels at 180 minutes of reperfusion in the tirilazad-treated  animals but not in the vehicle-treated dogs (vehicle, 28 +/- 4 ml/min/100 g;  tirilazad, 18 +/- 5 ml/min/100 g). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that tirilazad  pretreatment does not improve immediate metabolic recovery 3 hours following 12  minutes of normothermic complete ischemia produced by cerebral compression.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Hyaluronan is a polysaccharide normally present in low concentrations in the blood, and is rapidly cleared from the blood by the liver.  Increased plasma hyaluronan concentrations have been found in patients with  sepsis. We studied changes in serum hyaluronan concentrations and their  relationship to hemodynamics and survival in a 48-hr porcine model of injury and  sepsis. RESULTS: Circulating hyaluronan concentrations increased to high values  after induction of experimental sepsis (from mean baseline values of 242 +/- 26  [SEM] to mean maximum concentrations of 964 +/- 255 micrograms/L [p less than  .01]) compared with controls (199 +/- 38 to 303 +/- 32 micrograms/L). A weak  negative correlation between mean arterial pressure (MAP) and serum hyaluronan  values was found (r2 = .47; p less than .01). Nonsurvivors had higher mean serum  hyaluronan concentrations than survivors (603 +/- 147 vs. 285 +/- 43 micrograms/L  [p less than .05]). CONCLUSIONS: Experimental sepsis is associated with an  increase in serum hyaluronan values. The relationship between decreased MAP and  increased serum hyaluronan concentrations could point to reduced liver perfusion  as a cause. An association between high hyaluronan values and nonsurvival in  sepsis is possible.

AB  - Pulmonary barotrauma is a frequent, life-threatening complication in the pediatric patient who is treated with mechanical ventilation. The volumetric  diffusive respiration (VDR) ventilator, which employs a high-frequency  progressive accumulation of subtidal volume breaths in a pressure-limited format  with a percussive waveform, is capable of providing adequate gas exchange at  lower airway pressures; this theoretically decreases the incidence of pulmonary  barotrauma compared with conventional mechanical ventilation (CV). The incidence  of pulmonary barotrauma since 1988 was evaluated in pediatric patients with burns  who were younger than 2 years of age. Twenty-four patients who were treated with  only CV were compared with 15 patients who were treated with only VDR. Pulmonary  barotrauma was defined as the development of pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum,  pneumopericardium, or pneumoperitoneum. There were no significant differences  between CV-treated and VDR-treated groups (mean +/- SEM) in the patient  characteristics of age (15.9 +/- 1.3 months vs 16.6 +/- 1.8 months), weight (11.2  +/- 0.5 kg vs 12.5 +/- 0.7 kg), percent total body surface burn (46.2% +/- 4.9%  vs 55.6% +/- 6.2%), percent full-thickness burn (38.1% +/- 5.3% vs 50.0% +/-  6.6%), inhalation injury (40% vs 60%), or total number of days that mechanical  ventilation was required (18.2 +/- 4.2 days vs 22.4 +/- 5.9 days); although these  parameters show a slightly more severe degree of injury in the VDR-treated group.  There was a reduction in the incidence of pulmonary barotrauma when VDR was  used.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - Oxygenation improves in patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome and in animals with oleic acid-induced lung injury when they are turned from the supine  to the prone position. Dependent and nondependent pleural pressures (Ppl) were  measured in six pigs ventilated in the supine and prone positions before and  after volume infusion (VI). Before VI the mean +/- SEM AaPO2 difference was 26  +/- 8 mm Hg when the animals were supine and 10 +/- 2 mm Hg when they were prone  (p > 0.05). After VI the AaPO2 was 64 +/- 6 mm Hg when the animals were supine (p  < 0.05) and 43 +/- 7 mm Hg when they were prone (p < 0.05). VI increased the Ppl  gradient from 0.53 +/- 0.1 to 0.71 +/- 0.1 cm H2O/cm when the animals were supine  (p < 0.05) and from 0.17 +/- 0.1 to 0.27 +/- 0.1 cm H2O/cm when they were prone  (p < 0.05). Dependent Ppl at FRC was much less positive when the animals were  prone versus supine (0.9 +/- 0.3 versus 3.0 +/- 0.5 cm H2O, p < 0.05), suggesting  that the airways in these dependent regions would narrow and/or close and that  ventilation to these regions would diminish as a result of VI.

AB  - The alpha 2-adrenergic receptor agonist dexmedetomidine produces an anesthetic state in a variety of species. Although its effects on cerebral blood flow and  the electroencephalogram have been investigated, the effect of this drug on  intracranial pressure (ICP) has not been reported previously. Dexmedetomidine  therefore was intravenously administered to 24 New Zealand white rabbits that had  been anesthetized with halothane and mechanically ventilated to maintain a  constant arterial CO2 tension (PaCO2) between 34 and 39 mm Hg. After placement of  an arterial catheter and ventricular cannula, baseline measurements of monitored  variables, including heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, ICP, end-tidal  CO2, body temperature, and arterial blood gases, were recorded. Dexmedetomidine  (20, 80, or 320 micrograms/kg IV) or saline solution was then infused over a  10-min period. The ICP transiently decreased by 31% in the 20-micrograms/kg group  (from a mean value of 9.4 +/- 1.3 [SEM] to 6.5 +/- 1.0 mm Hg, P less than 0.05).  In the 320-micrograms/kg group, ICP remained unchanged over the course of the  study despite a significant increase in arterial blood pressure (32 mm Hg). The  effects of dexmedetomidine on ICP were next investigated in the presence of  intracranial hypertension produced by a cryogenic lesion (mean baseline ICP 16.8  mm Hg). In addition to the previously monitored variables, sagittal sinus blood  flow was measured by the hydrogen clearance technique before and after the  administration of dexmedetomidine (320 micrograms/kg IV). In these experiments,  dexmedetomidine was associated with a 14% decrease in sagittal sinus blood flow  that was not statistically significant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - Halothane anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats underwent 10 min of bilateral carotid artery occlusion with mean arterial pressure (MAP) held at 30, 50 or 60 mmHg.  Sham rats did not undergo ischemia. A 7-day recovery interval was allowed.  Intra-ischemic electroencephalographic (EEG) changes, behavioral function (Days  5-7), and histologic injury (Day 7) were evaluated. Under similar conditions,  cerebral blood flow was determined after 10 min ischemia by the [3H]nicotine  indicator fractionation technique. EEG isoelectricity was observed in 11 of 11, 5  of 10, and 2 of 11 rats in the 30 mmHg, 50 mmHg, and 60 mmHg groups respectively.  Neither passive avoidance cross-over latencies nor general motor scores were  affected by intra-ischemic MAP and no differences from sham performance were  observed. The per cent of CA1 neurons counted as dead (left and right hemispheres  combined) was significantly affected by intra-ischemic MAP (72, 46 and 28% in the  30 mmHg, 50 mmHg, and 60 mmHg groups, respectively; P less than 0.001). A greater  than 50% CA1 neuronal mortality rate was present only in those rats exhibiting  EEG isoelectricity. However, the number of rats demonstrating greater than a 25%  interhemispheric difference in CA1 neuronal loss was greatest in the 50 mmHg  group (P less than 0.02). Hippocampal blood flow decreased in association with  severity of hypotension (8 +/- 1, 35 +/- 8, and 48 +/- 2 ml/100 g/min (mean +/-  S.E.M.) for 30, 50, and 60 mmHg, respectively; P less than 0.01). Again, however,  the greatest variability in blood flow was observed at MAP = 50 mmHg.(ABSTRACT  TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - It has been postulated that reduction in anal resting pressure following low anterior resection is due to intraoperative injury to the internal anal sphincter  during transanal passage of the stapling device or damage to its nerve supply in  the course of rectal mobilization. The aim of this study was to assess the  relative importance of either mechanism. Fourteen dogs had a standard segment of  colon and distal rectum excised. Colorectal reconstruction was performed using  either a low stapled EEA (U.S. Surgical Corporation, Norwalk, CT) colorectal  anastomosis (n = 7) or a handsewn anastomosis (n = 7). Anorectal manometry was  performed preoperatively and again on the 10th postoperative day. Resting anal  pressure was significantly reduced after EEA anastomosis (mean +/- SEM: before,  49 +/- 3 mm Hg; after, 20 +/- 4 mm Hg; P less than 0.001) and handsewn  anastomosis (mean +/- SEM: before, 46 +/- 4 mm Hg; after, 35 +/- 4 mm Hg; P less  than 0.01). Postoperative resting pressures were also significantly reduced (P  less than 0.05) following EEA anastomosis when compared with the handsewn group.  This study suggests that damage to the innervation of the internal anal sphincter  during rectal mobilization and further direct injury to the sphincter during  transanal instrumentation both contribute to the fall in anal resting pressure  observed following low anterior resection.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The sequelae of myocardial ischaemia can in principle be alleviated by repeated reperfusion, but the accumulation of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and  the loss of interstitial adenosine may lead to adenylate depletion. Repeated  oxidative stress could predispose the heart to reperfusion injury. The aim of  this study was to investigate the effect of intermittent reperfusion on  myocardial energetics and postischaemic function. METHODS: Isolated retrogradely  perfused rat hearts were subjected to 20 min ischaemia, this being continuous in  group I while the hearts in group II were reperfused for three 2 min periods at 5  min intervals. Function and energy metabolism were evaluated during the  postischaemic reperfusion. RESULTS: Considerable efflux of adenosine compounds  was seen during the final reperfusion, this being greater in group I than in  group II, at 6.6(SEM 0.9) v 2.0(0.4) mumol.g-1 dry weight (p < 0.01). Tissue AMP,  inorganic phosphate, and adenosine catabolites were higher in group I than in II  after the ischaemic insult (p < 0.02), and ATP was higher in group II at the end  of the final reperfusion (p < 0.05). All the hearts recovered; however, in group  I the rate-pressure product was lower than in group II. CONCLUSIONS: Repetitive  reperfusion, although short in duration, is beneficial in ischaemia in terms of  lower adenylate loss and better postischaemic recovery. This should be taken into  consideration when designing clinical reperfusion interventions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Intratracheal instillation of bleomycin in rats has been extensively used as an animal model of pulmonary fibrosis in humans, although it produces a  patchy, airway based response. We proposed that the haemodynamic sequelae of the  bleomycin model might be less severe than those associated with more diffuse lung  injury. METHODS: Pulmonary and systemic haemodynamic indices were examined in  adult Sprague-Dawley rats (approximately 400 g, n = 10) both at rest and during  submaximal exercise on a rodent treadmill, approximately 60 days after  intratracheal bleomycin (6 units.kg-1), and the results compared to a control  group (n = 6). RESULTS: Compared to controls, mean pulmonary artery pressure  (PPA) was increased by intratracheal bleomycin (p = 0.02) both at rest [24.5 (SEM  2.6) v 18.2(0.9) mm Hg] and during exercise [34.7(3.0) v 26.7(0.7) mm Hg].  PPA-pulse product was also increased, with a similar trend in right ventricular  work index, but cardiac index was not altered. Right ventricular hypertrophy was  noted on necropsy examination. Consistent with pulmonary fibrosis, lung dry  weight, total protein, and hydroxyproline were also raised, and these values  correlated strongly with (mean) PPA at rest (r2 = 0.86, 0.81, 0.69, respectively)  and during exercise (r2 = 0.81, 0.79, 0.65, respectively). Packed cell volume was  increased by intratracheal bleomycin, at 49(1) v 45(1)%, p = 0.02. CaO2 tended to  decrease with exercise in the bleomycin group, although this was not  statistically significant, while systemic oxygen delivery and consumption were  not altered. CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular  hypertrophy occur in this model of lung fibrosis, and correlate with the severity  of fibrosis. However, these sequelae were less severe than those previously  demonstrated in association with crotalaria ingestion. We suggest that the  haemodynamic sequelae of the intratracheal bleomycin model are consistent with  patchy, airway based fibrosis, but reflect less well the haemodynamic sequelae of  more diffuse fibrotic injury associated with systemic processes.

This study extends the above studies by examining the effects  of stress protein synthesis on the limitation of infarct size in the in vivo  rabbit heart model. METHODS: 30 male New Zealand white rabbits were used. Six  rabbits were used for measurement of heat stress protein; 10 were used for  infarct size determination in a heat stress group (HS); 14 were used for infarct  size determination in a control group. There were 10 exclusions. Under  anaesthesia, body temperature was raised to 42 degrees C for 15 min in the HS  group. Following 24 hours of recovery rabbits were reanaesthetised and the hearts  subjected to a 45 min period of regional ischaemia followed by 3 h reperfusion.  The risk zone was defined with fluorescent particles and the infarct area  determined by tetrazolium staining. Western blotting showed an increase in the 72  KD heat stress protein in hearts in the HS group. RESULTS: Infarct size as a  percent of risk area was 61.4 (SEM 6.4)% (n = 14) in control hearts and  71.8(7.3)% (n = 10) in the HS hearts. These results were not statistically  significant. CONCLUSIONS: No protective effect of heat stress could be seen when  infarct size was used as the end point. Either the protection seen in earlier  studies using the Krebs perfused isolated heart model does not accurately reflect  protection against myocardial infarction, or heat stress itself may induce  injurious factors in the blood which will negate any direct protective effect to  the myocardium in this model.

T2  - The Journal of physiology
AB  - 1. Experiments were performed to measure the partial pressure of oxygen in the synovial fluid (Ps,O2) of the normal rabbit knee joint and assess the extent to  which this varied with changes in knee joint blood flow. 2. With the hypodermic  needle oxygen electrode sited just within the synovial cavity, Ps,O2 values  ranged from 25 to 72 mmHg with a mean of 48.2 +/- 3.1 (S.E.M.; n = 18). 3. Ps,O2  was found to decrease with increasing depth of penetration of the oxygen  electrode. Lowest values were observed close to the articular cartilage. 4.  Electrical stimulation of the posterior articular nerve (PAN) of the knee  resulted in vasoconstriction of knee joint blood vessels which was accompanied by  a decrease in Ps,O2. The frequency-response and voltage-response profiles to  electrical stimulation of PAN, although differing in magnitude, showed a high  degree of correlation between blood flow and Ps,O2. 5. As judged by the  conduction velocity, the vasoconstrictor response to nerve stimulation was  mediated by unmyelinated nerve fibres, presumed to be sympathetic postganglionic  fibres. 6. In view of the low Ps,O2 values occurring deep within the joint,  avascular structures such as cartilage could be subject to injury if sustained  reduction in synovial blood flow occurred. This could be a contributory factor in  the pathogenesis of degenerative and inflammatory joint diseases.

AB  - Oxygen free radicals have been shown to play a major role in the development of perfusion abnormalities, contractile dysfunction, and irreversible injury in  ischemic-reperfused myocardium. The aim of this study was to assess the direct  protective effects of radical scavengers, calcium antagonists, and combination of  these substances against free radical induced myocyte damage. Viability (% of  rod-shaped cells) and adenine nucleotide content (AdN, high-pressure liquid  chromatography) of isolated adult rat cardiomyocytes were measured after exposure  to hypoxanthine (2 mM) and xanthine oxidase (25 mU/ml). After 90 min, viability  of myocytes decreased to 4.2 +/- 3.4% (mean +/- SEM) of pre-exposure control, and  AdN decreased from 28.2 +/- 1.8 to 8.09 +/- 1.1 nmol/mg protein. Addition of  catalase (1500 U/ml) resulted in the preservation of viability (77 +/- 6% of  pre-exposure control, n = 6, mean +/- SEM), and AdN 84 +/- 6%, p less than 0.001.  These values are not significantly different from those measured in myocytes not  exposed to free radicals (88 +/- 9% and 79 +/- 6%, respectively). Superoxide  dismutase (2400 U/ml), dimethylthiourea (10 mM), and desferrioxamine (1 mM) did  not preserve either viability or AdN. The calcium antagonist verapamil (10  microM) also preserved myocyte viability significantly (23 +/- 9.7%, p less than  0.05 vs unprotected cells), but failed to prevent the loss of AdN (13.2 +/- 4%,  not significant as compared to unprotected cells). Viability and AdN in myocytes  treated with nifedipine (10 microM) or diltiazem (10 microM) were not higher than  in unprotected cells. All combined treatment forms which included catalase  resulted in the preservation of myocyte viability as well as AdN. These data show  that only the hydrogen peroxide scavenger catalase protects isolated  cardiomyocytes against free radicals generated in the purine catabolic pathway.

AB  - The present study examined whether the dual cyclooxygenase/lipoxygenase inhibitor phenidone would protect stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) from  stroke and hypertensive renal disease. Vehicle-treated SHRSP (N = 6), fed  stroke-prone rodent diet and 1% saline, exhibited severe systolic blood pressure  elevation (261 +/- 10 mm Hg, mean +/- SEM), marked proteinuria (90 +/- 12  mg/day), and stroke, with an average age at death of 14 +/- 1 weeks. In a second  group of six saline-loaded SHRSP, treatment with phenidone (60 mg/kg/day) was  started at 8.4 weeks of age. Despite establishment of severe hypertension in this  group (274 +/- 10 mm Hg), proteinuria remained at basal levels (28 +/- 13  mg/day), and signs of stroke were absent (P less than .01 v vehicle) through at  least 16 weeks of age. Phenidone treatment also prevented the declines in body  weight and food intake observed in vehicle-treated SHRSP, and maintained urine  volume and saline intake. Serum 12-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE)  generation was significantly inhibited greater than 50% in incubates of whole  blood from phenidone-treated SHRSP. We have previously shown that agents which  interfere with the renin-angiotensin system afford protection from renal and  cerebrovascular injury in saline-loaded SHRSP; cyclooxygenase inhibition alone  will hasten the onset of these pathologic changes. Whether phenidone, which has  been reported to attenuate angiotensin II-mediated effects, affords vascular  protection by interference with a lipoxygenase-mediated action of angiotensin II  remains to be elucidated.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To test the hypothesis that the heat shock response is associated with improved myocardial salvage after myocardial ischemia and reperfusion, rats  treated with prior whole-body hyperthermia and 24 hours of recovery (n = 26) or  20 minutes of ischemic pretreatment and 8 hours of recovery (n = 24) and control  rats (n = 27, n = 24, for hyperthermic and ischemic pretreatment, respectively)  were subjected to 35 minutes of left coronary artery (LCA) occlusion and 120  minutes of reperfusion. METHODS AND RESULTS: Although ventricular samples from  rats subjected to either hyperthermia (n = 7) or ischemic pretreatment (n = 6)  all showed induction of HSP72 (heat shock protein), Western blot analysis  revealed significantly greater amounts of HSP72 in samples obtained from rats  subjected to hyperthermia compared with those from rats subjected to ischemic  pretreatment. Control rats (n = 7) showed no significant presence of myocardial  HSP72. After 35 minutes of LCA occlusion and 2 hours of reperfusion, infarct size  was significantly reduced in heat-shocked rats compared with controls (8.4 +/-  1.7%, n = 26 versus 15.5 +/- 1.9%, n = 27; p = 0.007; mean +/- SEM; infarct  mass/left ventricular mass x 100). There were no significant differences in left  ventricular (LV) systolic pressure, heart rate, LV dP/dt, or rate-pressure  product between heat-shocked (n = 11) and control (n = 14) rats during the  ischemic period. There were no differences in infarct size between ischemically  pretreated and control rats subjected to 35 minutes of ischemia and reperfusion  (9.7 +/- 2.1%, n = 23 versus 10.0 +/- 2.1, n = 24; p = NS). CONCLUSIONS: In this  model of ischemia and reperfusion, prior heat shock was associated with  significantly improved myocardial salvage after 35 minutes of LCA occlusion and  reperfusion. This improved salvage was correlated with marked HSP72 induction and  was independent of the hemodynamic determinants of myocardial oxygen supply and  myocardial oxygen demand during the ischemic period. In contrast, mild HSP72  induction by ischemic pretreatment was not associated with improved myocardial  salvage after myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. Thus, the absolute levels of  HSP72 may be important in conferring protection from ischemic injury in this  animal model.

AB  - The susceptibility of the gastric mucosa to injury by topical sodium taurocholate (40 mmol/l) in hydrochloric acid (150 mmol/l) was studied in prehepatic and  cirrhotic rat models of portal hypertension. Portal venous pressure was increased  in rats who had undergone partial portal vein ligation compared with rats that  had undergone sham operation on days 3, 7, and 28 after operation (20.6 (0.9),  14.8 (0.8), and 11.3 (0.5) mm Hg v 7.3 (0.7), 7.3 (0.6), and 8.2 (0.2) mmHg  respectively (mean (SEM)). At day 3 gastric mucosal injuries were increased in  rats with partial portal vein ligation compared with sham operated rats (55.3  (9.4) vs 22.3 (10.5) mm2, p = 0.006), but at the later time intervals there was  no significant difference in injuries between the two groups. In rats with carbon  tetrachloride induced hepatic cirrhosis, portal pressure was increased (15.6  (1.0) v 6.7 (0.6) mmHg), but again there was no significant difference in mucosal  injuries relative to control animals. We conclude that gastric mucosal defence  mechanisms are impaired in acute but not chronic experimental portal  hypertension.

AB  - In 12 open-chest dogs, cardiac sympathetic nervous activity (CSNA) was recorded before and after occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery as  well as during reperfusion and ventricular fibrillation (VF). In 7 control  animals, CSNA did not significantly differ from preocclusion levels when  determined 20 min after occlusion (+3.5 +/- 1.5%, mean +/- SEM) and up to 15 min  following reperfusion (+1.5 +/- 0.6%). However, VF was associated with a  potential increase in CSNA by 106 +/- 15.5% (p less than 0.001). The effect of  lidocaine (6 mg/kg) on cardiac sympathetic tone was examined in 5 additional  animals. Lidocaine reduced control CSNA by 23 +/- 4.7% (p less than 0.001);  subsequent ischemia and reperfusion did not substantially change the level of  preocclusion activity. CSNA decreased significantly also during VF (52 +/- 4.2%,  p less than 0.001). In conclusion, efferent CSNA was slightly altered in the  course of acute myocardial ischemia and reperfusion, but significantly increased  during VF. Lidocaine produced marked attenuation of CSNA in anesthetized dogs.

T2  - Scandinavian journal of plastic and reconstructive surgery and hand surgery
AB  - The effect of total obstruction of blood flow on traumatically induced vasospasm was studied in the central arteries of rabbits' ears. All side branches were  ligated along a 7 cm segment of the artery. Obstruction of blood flow was  achieved by ligation of the central artery distal to this segment. The inner  diameter of the artery was measured microscopically after transillumination. A  standardised injury was induced with a clip applying forceps. The duration,  intensity (reduction of diameter) and severity (integrated change in diameter  over time) of the resulting spasm were assessed. Spasm induced after cessation of  blood flow lasted significantly less time (mean (SEM), 6.0 (2.0) minutes compared  with 18.1 (2.5) min) and was less severe than spasm induced when the blood flow  was intact (1.6 (0.6) mm/min compared with 6.2 (0.6) mm/min). The results may be  explained by local accumulation of vasodilating substances in the injured segment  of the vessel in the absence of blood flow.

T2  - Postgraduate medical journal
AB  - We have used the mercury in silastic strain gauge plethysmography (MSG) system, which is wholly non-invasive, to obtain values (mean +/- s.e.m.) for the  following parameters in the legs of supine control subjects: venous pressure (Pv)  9.89 +/- 0.88 mmHg, vascular compliance (Comp) 3.50 +/- 0.29 ml 100 g-1 mmHg-1 x  10(-2), microvascular hydraulic conductivity (Kf) 4.10 +/- 0.16 ml min-1 100 g-1  mmHg-1 x 10(-3) and isovolumetric venous pressure (Pvi) 22.12 +/- 0.82 mmHg. On  passive foot-down tilting of control subjects through about 45 degrees, both Pv  and Pvi rose to 28.00 +/- 2.33 and 36.58 +/- 2.29 mmHg respectively. The  increases in both parameters were highly significant, P < 0.0001. We found that  the time course of the vascular compliance component was short if small pressure  steps were used. The value increased markedly if large steps were used. We also  observed that none of the microvascular parameters studied in the arms differed  from those in the legs of the same subjects. We observed that the mean value Kf  in the arms of 12 young, non-neuropathic diabetics (9.08 +/- 6.12 x 10(-3)) was  significantly greater than that of age and sex-matched controls (P < 0.001).  Studies on 14 venous ulceration patients indicated that the values for Kf and Pv  were unchanged, whilst those of vascular compliance (5.60 +/- 0.58 x 10(-2) ml  100 g-1 mmHg-1) and Pvi (37.30 +/- 2.25 mmHg) were significantly greater than  those found in age-matched controls (P < 0.002 and 0.001, respectively). We feel  that Pvi is a useful index of microvascular perfusion. We attribute the  pressure-dependent difference, in the time course of the vascular compliance  response, to the veni-arteriolar reflex. We feel that the pressure dependency of  this response might form the basis for the assessment of peripheral autonomic  neuropathy. We believe that the MSG system offers a means of monitoring the  development of pathologies resulting from microvascular under-perfusion and, of  course, the improvement in response to therapeutic interventions.

AB  - This study attempted to determine the mechanism of anal canal motility after ileoanal anastomosis with the use of alpha-, beta- and muscarinic receptor  agents. Forty-five patients, 19 +/- 2 months after operation (mean plus or minus  S.E.M.) and 48 control volunteers were studied. Anal manometry indicated no  difference in maximum resting pressure and squeeze pressure between the patients  and the normal controls. Greater amplitude and less frequent anal canal slow  waves were a particular characteristic during the postoperative period.  Phentolamine (alpha-blocker) exhibited a stimulatory effect on anal resting tone  in the normal rectum, while propranolol (beta-blocker) and atropine (muscarinic  blocker) had no effect. However, alpha-, beta- and muscarinic receptors all had  stimulatory effects on postoperative anal tone. The muscarinic receptor had  dominant effects on the reduction in anal canal slow wave frequency after  ileoanal anastomosis. Our results indicated that neorectum after ileoanal  anastomosis had hybrid characteristics of both rectum and ileum. Through analysis  of receptor-related motor function, we may be able to improve our understanding  of dyscontinence after ileoanal anastomosis.

T2  - Journal of neurotrauma
AB  - Traumatic brain injury causes alterations in cerebral blood flow that are thought to influence secondary pathophysiology and neurologic outcome in humans. Since it  is difficult to study early changes in blood flow in head-injured patients,  animal models of brain injury must be employed. However, techniques to monitor  brain blood flow in animals are labor intensive and generally provide  discontinuous flow measurements. The present study examines the application of  laser-Doppler flowmetry for measurement of cerebral blood flow following  experimental brain injury. This method allows continuous monitoring of local  cerebral blood flow before, during, and after injury. Rats (n = 9) were prepared  for lateral fluid percussion injury under barbiturate anesthesia. Injury (2.10  +/- 0.02 atm) was induced over the right parietal cortex, and blood flow was  monitored in the contralateral cortex. Seconds after the peak hypertension after  injury, blood flow in the left parietal cortex increased 226% +/- 18% (means +/-  SEM). This increase was transient, with blood flow falling below control values  within minutes. Five minutes after injury, blood flow was 83% +/- 8% of control,  and at 1 h, this value had fallen to 56% +/- 6%. Blood flow at 60 min was 93% +/-  5% of control in the sham-injured group (n = 10). The reduction in cerebral blood  flow in our laser-Doppler study was of similar magnitude as previously reported  in rats injured at a similar intensity when blood flow was examined with  radiolabeled microspheres. Given these results, we believe laser-Doppler  flowmetry can be used to continuously monitor posttraumatic blood flow following  experimental brain injury.

AB  - Successful long-term myocardial preservation is dependent on optimizing conditions during arrest, storage, and reperfusion. Neonatal piglet hearts were  arrested and stored in University of Wisconsin solution (UW) at 4 degrees C for  24 hours and reperfused on a blood-perfused, adult animal-supported isolated  circuit. Results were compared with nonischemic continuously perfused control  hearts (group 1, n = 5). The initial 10 minutes of reperfusion in groups 2-4 was  modified by aspartate/glutamate-enriched leukocyte-depleted blood cardioplegia  (group 2, n = 7), leukocyte depletion alone (group 3, n = 9), and  aspartate/glutamate-enriched blood cardioplegia alone (group 4, n = 6). After 10  minutes, perfusion was continued with unmodified whole blood. In group 5 (n = 9),  unmodified whole blood was used for initial reperfusion as well as subsequent  perfusion. The stroke work index was determined 60 minutes after reperfusion.  Biopsies for high-energy phosphates, myocardial water content, and electron  microscopy were obtained after functional assessment. The stroke work index at  left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 9 mm Hg did not differ between groups  1 and 2 (19.0 +/- 1.4 x 10(3) and 19.0 +/- 1.5 x 10(3) [mean +/- SEM] erg/g,  respectively). These were both different from group 5 (13.3 +/- 0.8 x 10(3)  erg/g, p less than 0.05). Group 3 showed improved function (15.7 +/- 0.7 x 10(3)  erg/g), but this did not reach statistical significance when compared with group  5. No difference was found between groups 4 and 5. Myocardial water content,  high-energy phosphate levels, and ultrastructure were similar in all  groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - This study compares the nutritional status and dietary intake of 14 tubefed nursing home patients with pressure sores (age: 70 +/- 5 years, mean +/- SEM) to  12 tubefed patient-controls without sores (age: 60 +/- 7 years). Patients tended  to have higher calorie intake (32 +/- 3 kcal/kg) than patient-controls (26 +/- 2  kcal/kg, p = 0.11). Protein intake was significantly higher in patients (1.4 +/-  0.2 g/kg) than patient-controls (0.9 +/- 0.1 g of protein per kg, p less than  0.05). Despite increased calorie and protein intake, biochemical measures of  nutritional status were worse in the patients. Serum albumin was lower in  patients (33 +/- 1 g/L) than in patient-controls (37 +/- 1 g/L, p less than 0.05)  as was level of hemoglobin (patients: 117 +/- 5; patient-controls: 132 +/- 5 g/L,  p less than 0.05). Patients with stage IV (severe) sores had lower serum  cholesterol levels (3.46 +/- 0.31 mmol/L, n = 5) than patients with stage II/III  (milder) sores (4.58 +/- 0.23 mmol/L, n = 9, p less than 0.05). Plasma zinc was  low in both patients (11.2 +/- 0.6 mumol/L) and patient-controls (11.5 +/- 0.7  mumol/L, p = NS). Pressure sore surface area was positively correlated with  calorie intake per kilogram of body weight (r = +0.59, p less than 0.04) and  negatively correlated with body mass index (r = -0.70, p less than 0.03),  hemoglobin (r = -0.55, p less than 0.07) and serum cholesterol (r = -0.57, p less  than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Oxygen radical injury in the immature isolated rabbit heart.
AU  - Parrish, M. D.
T2  - Journal of developmental physiology
AB  - We speculated that the increased vulnerability of the immature rabbit heart to global ischemia might be due to an increased susceptibility to free radical  injury. To evaluate this, we exposed newborn (age 2.4 +/- 0.3 days, n = 20) (mean  +/- SEM), juvenile (2 to 3 weeks, mean 16.6 +/- 0.5 days, n = 20), and adult (5  to 7 months old, n = 20) isolated, isovolumic, Krebs perfused rabbit hearts to  oxygen radicals or cumene hydroperoxide. Control hearts showed no deterioration  in left ventricular developed pressure over 60 min (newborns = 104 +/- 11%,  juveniles = 101 +/- 7%, and adults = 113 +/- 12% of baseline, n = 5 for each age  group). After only 30 min of oxygen radical exposure, the newborn group developed  pressure decreased to 49 +/- 6% of the baseline value, while juveniles and adults  were functioning at 70 +/- 10% and 83 +/- 6% of baseline, respectively (n = 10  for each age group) (P less than 0.05, newborn different from adult group). In  contrast to the oxygen radical protocol, the hearts exposed to cumene  hydroperoxide showed no significant difference between the age groups in  deterioration of left ventricular function. There was no significant difference  between the age groups in ATP content or thiobarbituric reactive substances  following the oxygen radical exposure. We conclude that the newborn rabbit heart  is significantly more vulnerable than the adult heart to the toxic effects of  oxygen radicals. This may account, in part, for age related differences in  response to global ischemia and reperfusion.

AB  - There is increasing evidence that nitric oxide (NO) synthetized in vascular endothelium and in platelets by NO synthase influences vascular tone, down  regulates platelet function and platelet-vessel wall interaction both in vitro  and in vivo. We investigated the effect of a NO synthase inhibitor,  NG-mono-methyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA, 100 mg/kg iv) on platelet-endothelial cell  interaction in rabbit arteries ex vivo using scanning electron microscope (SEM).  The effect of L-NMMA was examined on intact endothelium and on that damaged by  arterial constriction. The infusion of L-NMMA increased systemic blood pressure  and decreased carotid blood flow, however, it did not change the appearance of an  intact endothelium and did not result in platelet activation on intact  endothelial cells. In contrast, SEM of endothelial areas damaged by constriction  showed extensive platelet adhesion and aggregation on subendothelium. These  morphological changes were not detected in control animals with intact or damaged  by arterial constriction endothelium. These results show that under physiological  conditions, the inhibition of NO synthase alone does not result in platelet  activation in vivo. However, when combined with endothelial injury it may lead to  platelet activation and thrombosis.

AB  - Four hours of complete normothermic ischemia in the rat hindlimb has been thought to produce extensive and irreversible damage and no possibility of salvage by  reperfusion. This study tests the hypothesis that, in contrast to conventional  wisdom, the cellular integrity is preserved after 4 hours of complete warm  ischemia and control of the initial reperfusion can restore immediate  contractility in these limbs. Ninety-two rat hindlimbs were isolated and 26 of  the 92 did not undergo ischemia or reperfusion and served as controls. Sixty-six  limbs were subjected to 4 hours of complete warm ischemia; of those 34 were  assessed after the ischemic period without reperfusion and 32 were reperfused  after the ischemic period. Nineteen hindlimbs were reperfused with  Krebs-Henseleit buffer at a pressure of 100 mmHg to simulate embolectomy  (uncontrolled reperfusion). In 13 legs a modified reperfusate at a pressure of 60  mmHg was used during the initial 30 minutes followed by an additional 30 minutes  of reperfusion with 100 mmHg using Krebs-Henseleit buffer (controlled  reperfusion). At the end of each experimental protocol, limbs were assessed by  the following methods: muscle contraction, water content, volume, high energy  phosphate content, muscle pH, effluent pH, mitochondrial function,  ultrastructure, flow, and creatinkinase activity in the effluent. Data are  expressed as mean +/- SEM. Significant differences were defined as probabilities  for each test of p less than 0.05. Four hours of complete warm ischemia resulted  in a severe reduction of adenosine triphosphate (4.0 +/- 0.8 vs 27.1 +/- 6.7  mumol/gm protein, p less than 0.001) and no contractions could be stimulated (0.0  +/- 0.0% CC). Muscle pH fell to 6.3 +/- 0.1 (p less than 0.001), and  ultrastructural damage occurred (score 3.3 +/- 0.4 vs 0.8 +/- 0.1, p less than  0.002). However, there was only a slight increase in water content of the soleus  muscle (78.7 +/- 0.2% vs 74.8 +/- 1.1%, p less than 0.05) without increase in  limb volume (103.6 +/- 0.6% CV). In addition mitochondrial function was preserved  well: mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation capacity remained at 94% of control  levels, ST3 at 93%, and ADP/O at 100% of control. Most importantly, controlled  reperfusion restored immediate contractility in all limbs and was superior in all  parameters investigated compared to uncontrolled reperfusion. These data support  our inference that necrosis of skeletal muscle does not invariably occur after  four hours of complete warm ischemia and suggest that muscle salvage by  controlled reperfusion is possible after at least 4 hours of warm ischemia.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: The aim was to determine whether the potent iron chelator desferrioxamine, previously shown by our laboratory and others to cause acute  limitation of infarct size, would provide sustained protection against myocardial  ischaemia-reperfusion injury. DESIGN: Anaesthetised dogs underwent a 2 h  transient coronary artery occlusion. After surgical preparation, each dog was  randomised into one of two groups receiving either desferrioxamine or equivalent  infusion of saline. Infusion of desferrioxamine was initiated 30 min before  occlusion at an initial dose of 10 mg.kg-1 for the first hour of the protocol,  followed by a maintenance dose of 1.5 mg.kg-1.h-1 throughout the remainder of the  ischaemic period and the initial 4 h of reperfusion. The animals were  reanaesthetised the following day and killed 20-24 h following reperfusion.  Variables measured included heart rate and arterial pressures; regional  myocardial blood flow; urinary iron content; and infarct size. In addition, %  wall thickening in the ischaemic-reperfused myocardium was assessed by  echocardiography in a limited number of animals. EXPERIMENTAL MATERIAL: 12  mongrel dogs weighing 22(SEM 4) kg were used, n = 6 in each group. MEASUREMENTS  AND MAIN RESULTS: Both groups were equally and severely ischaemic during coronary  artery occlusion. Desferrioxamine caused a modest and transient reduction in mean  arterial pressure during the ischaemic episode, but had no effect on heart rate  or myocardial blood flow. As expected, urinary iron content was significantly  higher in treated animals v controls, at 465(SEM 107) v 55(23) micrograms, p less  than 0.01, indicating that desferrioxamine effectively chelated free iron.  However, it failed to exert a significant cardioprotective effect: infarct size  did not differ between control and treated groups [54(4)% v 58(5)% of the  myocardium at risk], and wall thickening was similar throughout occlusion and  reperfusion in control and desferrioxamine treated animals. CONCLUSIONS: Despite  substantial reduction in infarct size previously observed at 4 h following reflow  with the same dose and regimen of desferrioxamine treatment, results of the  present study indicate that desferrioxamine did not provide sustained protection  against myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion injury. We therefore conclude that  desferrioxamine delays--but does not prevent--myocyte necrosis in this canine  model.

AB  - Free radicals have been implicated in the pathogenesis of reperfusion injury, but it is unclear how they exert their deleterious effects on cellular metabolism.  Several lines of indirect evidence suggest that free radicals elevate  intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and inhibit glycolysis as part of  their mechanism of injury. We tested these ideas directly in hearts subjected to  hydroxyl radicals produced by the Fenton and Haber-Weiss reactions. Nuclear  magnetic resonance spectra were obtained from Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts  before, during, and after 4 min of perfusion with H2O2 (0.75 mM) and  Fe(3+)-chelate (0.1 mM). Isovolumic left ventricular pressure exhibited  progressive functional deterioration and contracture after exposure to H2O2 +  Fe3+. Phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra revealed partial ATP  depletion and sugar phosphate accumulation indicative of glycolytic inhibition.  To measure [Ca2+]i, fluorine NMR spectra were acquired in a separate group of  hearts loaded with the Ca2+ indicator 5F-BAPTA [5,5'-difluoro derivative of  1,2-bis-(o-aminophenoxy)ethane- N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid]. Mean time-averaged  [Ca2+]i increased from 347 +/- 14 nM in control to 1,026 +/- 295 nM 4 min after  free radical generation (means +/- SEM, n = 7), and remained elevated thereafter.  We conclude that free radicals induce clear-cut, specific derangements of  cellular metabolism in the form of glycolytic inhibition and calcium overload.  The observed increase in [Ca2+]i suggests that the deleterious effects of free  radicals are at least partially mediated by secondary changes in cellular calcium  homeostasis.

AB  - The elevation and clearance of extracellular potassium following a standard contusion injury was studied in the thoracic spinal cord of rats. Animals were  anesthetized, paralyzed, laminectomized at T9-T11, then artificially ventilated.  A 10-g rod was released 5.0 cm above the cord with the dura intact. After impact,  the dura-arachnoid and pial membranes were incised to allow penetration of  K(+)-selective microelectrodes. Electrodes utilized a valinomycin ionophore and  were double-barreled, with tip diameters of 3-5 microns. Extracellular potassium  activity ([K+]o) increased with the depth of penetration. The maximum values of  [K+]o occurred at depths greater than 500 microns, and remained so with time  after injury. These data indicate that a dorsal-ventral gradient of [K+]o  develops in spinal cords contused from the dorsal surface, with the greatest  elevation of [K+]o in the gray matter. In 8 preparations, the maximum [K+]o was  65 +/- 8 mM (mean +/- S.E.M.) at 5 +/- 1 min after injury. The [K+]o peak values  decayed with a half-time of 11.0 +/- 3.4 min. Compared with data available for  the injured cat spinal cord, the peak [K+]o recovered relatively rapidly.  Although a simple diffusion model could account for the rapid clearance of [K+]o,  the persistence of dorsal-ventral [K+]o gradients could not be explained by such  a model. It is postulated that secondary injury processes contributed to the  persistent [K+]o gradients.

AB  - In order to investigate inner ear barotrauma, guinea pigs were subjected to rapid decompression between 2 absolute pressure (ATA) and 1 ATA in a chamber. After  pressure loading and observation for absence of Preyer's reflex, they were  sacrificed immediately, 1 day, 1 week and 1 month later, respectively. Then,  morphological changes of the organ of Corti and stria vascularis were studied  under TEM and SEM. The immediate features noted were fracture of stereocilia with  minimal intracellular changes. One day later, there was marked degeneration of  outer hair cells and expansion of supporting cells. The damage to stereocilia  clearly preceded morphological alterations within hair cell bodies and cannot be  interpreted as arising secondary to hair cell degeneration. Most of outer hair  cells eventually disappeared and were replaced by supporting cells. Inner hair  cells degenerated slowly; 1 month later, some of them remained almost intact,  despite disappearance of stereocilia. The continuity of reticular lamina was  maintained not only immediately but also through the period of hair cell  degeneration, thus preventing any leakage of endolymph into the organ of Corti.  There was reversible dendritic swelling of inner hair cells immediately following  the trauma. No changes of stria vascularis were observed over passage of time.  The mechanism of hair cell damage due to inner ear barotrauma is presumed to be a  deformity of the organ of Corti caused by pressure discrepancy between perilymph  and endolymph resulting in an injury to stereocilia.

T2  - Scandinavian journal of clinical and laboratory investigation
AB  - Inhibitors of the arachidonic acid metabolism (AA) as well as scavengers of oxygen free radicals (OFR) have been shown to reduce myocardial infarct size. We  investigated the effects of two inhibitors of AA metabolism on the cardiac  effects of OFR. Isolated rat hearts were retrogradely perfused for 10 min with  buffer containing hypoxanthine (HX, 1 mmol l-1) and xanthine oxidase (XOD: 24 U  l-1) alone (n = 11), or with the addition of ibuprofen (IBU) (n = 6) (a  cyclooxygenase inhibitor) or BW 755C (n = 6) (a dual inhibitor of cyclo-oxygenase  and lipoxygenase). The hearts were observed for 30 min thereafter (total  observation time 40 min). Left-ventricular pressures were measured by a balloon  in the left ventricle. HX + XOD significantly reduced left-ventricular developed  pressure (LVDP) and coronary flow (CF), but not heart rate. The reduction of LVDP  and CF was not significantly ameliorated by the addition of IBU (7.6 x 10(-4) mol  l-1) or BW 755C (2 x 10(-3) mmol l-1). OFR increased left-ventricular  end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) from (mean +/- SEM) 0 to 22 +/- 4 mmHg (10 min)  and 30 +/- 5 mmHg (40 min). Upon addition of IBU, LVEDP increased from 0 to 24  +/- 8 mmHg and 17 +/- 6 mmHg at 10 and 40 min respectively. The addition of BW  755C almost completely inhibited the increase in LVEDP (1 +/- 1 mmHg and 3 +/- 3  mmHg at 10 min and 40 min). In conclusion, except for inhibition of OFR-induced  diastolic dysfunction by BW 755C, neither BW 755C nor IBU appear to inhibit  cardiac injury induced by OFR.

T2  - Cardiovascular research
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: The aim was to compare the protective efficacy of diltiazem as an additive to St Thomas's Hospital cardioplegic solution in isolated hearts from  neonatal and adult rabbits. DESIGN: The relative responsiveness of the two age  groups to diltiazem was first determined in Langendorff perfused hearts (n = 6  per group) by constructing concentration-response curves for the drug's negative  inotropic effect. The IC20 and IC50 of diltiazem (the concentrations of diltiazem  resulting in 20% or 50% reduction in developed pressure, respectively) were the  doses subsequently included in the cardioplegic solution. Isolated working hearts  (n = 8 per group) were perfused aerobically (37 degrees C) for 20 min followed by  a 2 min infusion of St Thomas's Hospital cardioplegic solution with or without  added diltiazem. All hearts were then subjected to global ischaemia (37 degrees  C). The durations of ischaemia were 60 min in the neonatal and 45 min in the  adult heart. Hearts were then reperfused (15 min Langendorff, 20 min working)  before reassessment of function. EXPERIMENTAL ANIMALS: 30 neonatal (7-10 d) and  30 adult (2-3 months) New Zealand white rabbits were used. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN  RESULTS: The IC20 and IC50 of diltiazem were found to be 0.1 and 0.5  mumol.litre-1, respectively, in the neonatal heart, and 0.5 and 2.5  mumol.litre-1, respectively, in the adult heart. Postischaemic recovery of  cardiac output was 57.9(SEM 6.7)% in the control group and 64.1(5.0)% (NS) and  47.7(3.8)% (NS) in the 0.5 mumol.litre-1 and 2.5 mumol.litre-1 diltiazem groups,  respectively, in the adult hearts. In the neonatal hearts, cardiac output  recovered to 55.6(4.8)% in the control group and 59.9(4.2)% (NS) and 62.0(5.6)%  (NS) in the 0.1 mumol.litre-1 and 0.5 mumol.litre-1 diltiazem groups,  respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of diltiazem, at IC20 or IC50 negative  inotropic concentrations, to St Thomas's Hospital cardioplegic solution does not  improve postischaemic recovery in either neonatal or adult rabbit hearts. This  suggests that the slow calcium channel may not be an important mediator of  ischaemia and reperfusion induced injury in the cardioplegically arrested rabbit  heart.

AB  - Fibreoptic orotracheal intubation was compared with orthodox laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation using a total i.v. technique with propofol in 60 ASA I and II  patients. There was no significant difference between the two techniques in  haemodynamic profile (before, during and following the intubation procedure) and  incidence of postoperative sore throat. Minimal oxygen saturation was 96% during  the study; maximal end-tidal PCO2 after intubation was 5.4 kPa. Intubation time  was faster (P less than 0.01) in the orthodox group (30.7 (SEM 2.3) s) than in  the fibreoptic group (52.7 (4.8) s).

AB  - Earlier studies have demonstrated an improvement in the recovery of the regional myocardial function after reversible myocardial ischemia when dogs were treated  with superoxide dismutase (SOD) + catalase (CAT). In all these studies, drug  administration was started prior to the ischemic period. The aim of this study  was to investigate the effects of SOD and CAT on the recovery of the regional  contractile function in anesthetized beagle dogs when the drugs were administered  at the time of reperfusion. The animals were subjected to 20 min of left coronary  artery occlusion followed by 3 h reperfusion. The regional myocardial contractile  function, measured as subendocardial segment shortening (SS, sonomicrometry)  decreased to below zero and the regional blood flow in the ischemic  subendocardium was reduced to about 5% of pre-ischemic values during the coronary  artery occlusion period. The size of the occluded bed was similar in the two  groups. Saline (n = 8) or SOD (10 mg/kg) + CAT (3.4 mg/kg) (n = 8) were infused  into the left atrium from 2.5 min prior to until 20 min after the start of  reperfusion. The peak plasma level of SOD was 102 +/- 15 mg/l at 20 min  reperfusion. There were no significant differences in the arterial blood  pressure, cardiac contractile function and regional blood flow between the two  groups at any time during the experiment. During reperfusion in the dogs given  vehicle, SS recovered to 48 +/- 7% (mean +/- SEM) after the first hour of  reperfusion, and to 51 +/- 6% of pre-ischemic values after 3 h of  reperfusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - Disordered gastroduodenal motility may promote duodenal ulceration by allowing prolonged acid contact with the duodenal mucosa. Using a multilumen perfused  catheter incorporating 3 pH microelectrodes, antral and duodenal pH and  antropyloroduodenal pressure activity were recorded in 36 subjects (10 with  healed duodenal ulceration, 11 with active duodenal ulceration, and 15 healthy  volunteers) during fasting and after a radiolabeled solid test meal. Correct pH  probe/catheter position was continuously verified by recording transmucosal  potential difference across the pylorus. Patients with active and healed duodenal  ulcer had similarly disordered gastroduodenal motility. The chief abnormalities  consisted of an increase in postprandial duodenal retroperistalsis (healed  duodenal ulceration, 12 +/- 1 events per hour; active duodenal ulceration, 12 +/-  1; control, 6 +/- 1; mean +/- SEM: healed and active duodenal ulceration vs.  control, P = 0.004 and P = 0.03, respectively), a reduction in pressure waves  sweeping aborally through the duodenum after the meal (healed duodenal  ulceration, 22 +/- 4 events per hour; active duodenal ulceration, 23 +/- 3;  control, 34 +/- 4: healed and active duodenal ulceration vs. control, P = 0.04  and P less than 0.05, respectively), and an increased incidence of atypical,  complex forms of coordinated duodenal motor activity throughout the study  (postprandial data; healed duodenal ulceration, 8 +/- 1 events per hour; active  duodenal ulceration, 10 +/- 1; control, 4 +/- 1: healed and active duodenal  ulceration vs. control, P = 0.02 and P less than 0.02, respectively). In  addition, gastric emptying of the solid test meal was significantly delayed in  healed, but not active, duodenal ulceration [half-emptying time, healed duodenal  ulceration 185 minutes (117-235); active duodenal ulceration 102 minutes  (80-200); control 107 minutes (78-130): healed duodenal ulceration vs. control, P  less than 0.009]. Duodenal bulb pH was similar in controls and patients with  active duodenal ulceration; however, bulb pH was less than 4 for a significantly  greater period of time in healed duodenal ulceration compared with active ulcer  patients, particularly after the meal. In conclusion, duodenal ulcer disease is  associated with disturbed gastroduodenal motility, even when the ulcer is  quiescent and when intraduodenal acidity is low. In healed duodenal ulceration,  disturbed motility may promote ulcer relapse by impairing acid clearance from the  bulb. However, in active ulceration other factors such as mucosal bicarbonate  secretion may have a more influential role in determining intraduodenal pH.

TI  - Thermal skin injury: effect of fluid therapy on the transcapillary colloid osmotic gradient.
AU  - Onarheim, H.
AU  - Reed, R. K.
T2  - The Journal of surgical research
AB  - The effects of fluid therapy on interstitial colloid osmotic and hydrostatic pressures in thermally injured skin were investigated in anesthetized rats  subjected to full-thickness scald burns to 40% of the body surface area and  resuscitation for 3 hr by either lactated Ringer's or plasma. Interstitial fluid  hydrostatic pressure (Pif) was reduced from -2 mm Hg to -20 to -40 mm Hg after  injury, which will profoundly increase transcapillary filtration. Following the  onset of fluid therapy, Pif increased to slightly positive values. In control,  colloid osmotic pressure in plasma (COPp) was 20.6 +/- 0.4 mm Hg and in  interstitial fluid (COPif) 13.7 +/- 0.3 mm Hg (means +/- SEM). The transcapillary  oncotic pressure gradient (COPgrad = COPp-COPif) was 6.9 +/- 0.4 mm Hg. Following  nonresuscitated thermal injury, COPp declined to 18-19 mm Hg (P less than 0.05)  and COPif was reduced to 10.4 +/- 0.5 mm Hg (P less than 0.05). Fluid therapy by  lactated Ringer's markedly reduced COPp (12.3 +/- 0.3 mm Hg; P less than 0.05),  and COPgrad was almost abolished (2.6 +/- 0.7 mm Hg; P less than 0.05). In  contrast, plasma infusion maintained COPp, whereas COPgrad increased  significantly (11.1 +/- 1.2 mm Hg; P less than 0.05). Noncolloid saline solutions  have been preferred for the initial fluid therapy for burns. The present study  provides evidence that this will reduce both COPp and COPgrad, a situation in  which edema formation will be favored.

AB  - To show relationship between degree of carotid arterial stenosis and cerebral blood flow reactivity (RES%) to induced hypercapnia, fluorine-18-fluoromethane  and positron emission tomography (PET) was used to study 18 patients with carotid  distribution transient ischaemic attacks (TIA), all free of stroke, who had  angiographic-proven unilateral arterial disease. Non-involved carotid arteries  were either normal or had non-stenotic plaque. Either normal arteries or  nonstenotic ulcerations in the symptomatic carotid arteries were present in five  of 18 (28%), ipsilateral carotid stenosis from 50-99% was present in eight of 18  (44%), and ipsilateral internal carotid occlusion was present in five of 18 (28%)  patients. In comparison with 14 normal controls, all patients with symptomatic  middle cerebral artery (MCA) flow territories had significantly lower mean (SEM)  RES% [5.0' (0.2) vs 4.0 (0.9), p less than 0.04]. Symptomatic anterior borderzone  (ABZ) RES% was also significantly lower [4.6 (0.4) vs 3.3 (0.9), p less than  0.04], than controls. In patient subgroup comparisons, the 50-99% stenosis  subgroup clearly had the lowest MCA RES% [3.4 (0.2)] as well as the lowest ABZ  RES% [2.8 (0.4)] on their symptomatic sides. Age, expired pCO2, mean arterial  blood pressure, serum glucose, serum haematocrit and number, type and estimated  duration of TIAs were not significantly different between subgroups. Linear  regression showed a significant relationship between RES% and both measured  percentage-stenosis (p = 0.04) and residual luminal diameter (p = 0.05) in  symptomatic MCA territories. This approached significance in symptomatic ABZ  regions. This preliminary data set suggests that unilateral carotid stenosis can  and does result in impaired CO2 reactivity following hypercapnia. The relative  normality of CO2 reactivity in those with carotid occlusion is discussed.

TI  - Improvement in contractile recovery of isolated rat heart after cardioplegic ischaemic arrest with endogenous phosphocreatine: involvement of antiperoxidative  effect?
AU  - Conorev, E. A.

T2  - Cardiovascular research
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: The aim was to attempt to get further insight into the mechanism of the cardioprotective action of phosphocreatine (PCr). DESIGN: Three  experimental protocols were used: (1) The effect was examined of exogenous PCr  (10 mmol.litre-1) on myocardial oxidative damage produced by H2O2 perfusion (90  mumol.litre-1) of isolated rat heart. (2) Isolated rat hearts were subjected to  35 min cardioplegic ischaemia followed by reperfusion. A control group was  studied along with two PCr groups, one corrected for Ca2+ to compensate its  binding with PCr (1.4 mmol.litre-1 CaCl2 in St Thomas's Hospital cardioplegic  solution), and the other not (1.2 mmol.litre-1). (3) The effect was studied of  PCr alone and in combination with the antioxidant tocopherol phosphate (0.1  mumol.litre-1) on contractile and metabolic recovery of isolated rat heart  reperfused after 40 min cardioplegic ischaemia. EXPERIMENTAL MATERIAL: Studies  were performed on hearts of 84 male Wistar rats, weighing 250-300 g. MEASUREMENTS  AND MAIN RESULTS: (1) Oxidative stress resulted in irreversible contracture and  impairment of sarcolemmal integrity revealed by using the transmembrane tracer  ionic lanthanum. These effects coincided with the decrease of developed pressure  from 116 (SEM 3) to 38(3) mm Hg and rate-pressure product from 498(13) to 165(16)  mm Hg.s-1. The Ca2+ binding property of PCr was estimated experimentally and the  stability constant of the complex CaPCr was found to be 35.4(0.7) mmol; from this  the Ca2+ bound by PCr was calculated to be 14% in the experimental conditions  used. Ca2+ concentration in K-H buffer containing PCr was increased to compensate  its binding with PCr. PCr prevented H2O2 induced contracture, preserved  sarcolemmal integrity, and attenuated H2O2 induced decrease in developed pressure  and rate-pressure product [73(6) mm Hg and 340(28) mm H.s-1, respectively, p less  than 0.05 compared with control]. (2) PCr reduced the diastolic pressure [29(10)  v 68(10) mm Hg in control group at 30 min of reperfusion, p less than 0.05] and  enhanced the developed pressure [81(10) v 46(10) mm Hg in controls, p less than  0.05] and rate-pressure product [325(44) v 158(40) mm Hg.s-1 in controls, p less  than 0.05]. When CaCl2 was increased to 1.4 mmol.litre-1 the protective effect of  PCr was not abolished. (3) PCr resulted in improvement of developed pressure  [49(7) v 18(5) mm Hg in controls at 40 min of reperfusion, p less than 0.05] and  rate-pressure product [184(27) v 71(20) mm Hg.s-1 in controls, p less than 0.05].  The degree of contractile recovery in the tocopherol group was almost the same as  in the PCr group. Combined addition of PCr and tocopherol further increased the  developed pressure and rate-pressure product to 72(4) mm Hg and 284(23) mm  Hg.s-1, respectively. Similarly, PCr and tocopherol in combination provided  substantial inhibition of creatine kinase release into perfusate, at 3.8(0.4) v  10.9(2.5) IU in controls, p less than 0.05. CONCLUSIONS: PCr decreases the  vulnerability of myocardium to oxidative stress and ischaemic damage. These  effects cannot be explained by PCr induced shifts in Ca2+ concentration.  Protective effects of PCr and tocopherol are quantitatively additive, most  probably due to their different mechanisms of action, and tocopherol may be  effective in extending the ability of PCr to stabilise cell membrane structure.

T2  - The Journal of heart and lung transplantation : the official publication of the International Society for Heart Transplantation
AB  - The objective of this study was to assess the utility of the heterotopically transplanted rat heart as a model in which to assess long-term (0 to 7 days)  postischemic recovery. This was achieved by characterizing the metabolic,  functional, and histologic changes that occur during the first week after  implantation. In the first series of studies (n = 6/group), hearts were subjected  to 1 hour of global ischemia at room temperature (21 degrees +/- 1 degree C),  during which time they were transplanted into the abdomens of the recipients. A  permanently implanted intraventricular balloon was used to measure  pressure-volume relationships in the implanted heart 1, 4, 8, 12, and 18 hours  and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 days after transplantation. Left ventricular  developed pressure (70 microliters loading volume) was 125 +/- 14 mm Hg (mean +/-  SEM) after 1 hour of reperfusion, declining to 79 +/- 15 mm Hg after 4 hours  before increasing to a maximum (158 +/- 14 mm Hg) at 24 hours. The pressure  subsequently declined to 108 +/- 16 mm Hg by 3 days, and then remained  essentially unchanged for the following 4 days. Heart rate declined to 197 +/- 26  beats/min after 1 hour of reperfusion, recovered to 380 +/- 21 beats/min after 24  hours, and remained above 300 beats/min for the remainder of the experiment. Left  ventricular end-diastolic pressure increased progressively to very high levels  through the 7-day period (176 +/- 23 mm Hg at 7 days). Analysis of creatine  phosphate (CP) and of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and its breakdown products  indicated a loss of high-energy phosphates after 1 hour of ischemia (CP = 4.8 +/-  0.3 mumol/gm dry wt), a recovery to preischemic values after 24 hours (CP = 24.4  +/- 2.5 vs 23.8 +/- 1.3 mumol/gm dry weight in fresh control hearts), and a  subsequent decline over the ensuing 6 days (CP = 8.1 +/- 1.5 mumol/gm dry wt at 7  days). In additional studies to assess the functional capacity of the unloaded  transplanted heart, hearts were excised 1 hour and 1 day after transplantation  and perfused as isolated working preparations: their function was then compared  with that of fresh nontransplanted hearts. A time-dependent deterioration of all  indices of cardiac function was observed. Morphologic studies of transplanted  hearts with and without an inserted and inflated intraventricular balloon  revealed a rapid reduction of left ventricular cavity volume during the first 24  hours in hearts without a balloon, and progressive severe fibrosis,  endomyocardial necrosis, and inflammation over the 7-day period in hearts in  which the balloon was intermittently inflated for functional assessment.(ABSTRACT  TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

AB  - Surfactant inactivation has been shown to be a significant factor in animal models of lung injury and may also be important in some forms of respiratory  failure in full-term newborns. Fourteen full-term newborns with respiratory  failure associated with pneumonia (7 patients) and meconium aspiration syndrome  (7 patients) were treated with 90 mg/kg of a calf lung surfactant extract, given  intratracheally up to every 6 hours for a maximum of four doses. The group mean  fraction of inspired oxygen (FI02) before treatment was 0.99 +/- 0.01 SEM, and  the mean airway pressure (MAP) was 14.6 +/- 1.0 cm H2O. Patients showed  significant improvement in oxygenation after initial surfactant treatment, with  the arterial-alveolar oxygenation ratio (a/A ratio) rising from 0.09 +/- 0.01  before surfactant treatment to 0.22 +/- 0.05 by 15 minutes (P = .03) and  remaining improved for 6 hours. The oxygenation index, incorporating MAP as well  as oxygen variables, also improved significantly from 26.2 +/- 3.1 to 11.2 +/-  1.7 at 15 minutes (P less than .001), with improvement sustained for more than 6  hours. Chest radiographs were blindly scored from 0 (normal) to 5 (severe  opacification), and these improved with marginal significance after initial  surfactant treatment (from 2.9 +/- 0.2 to 2.5 +/- 0.2, P = .05).(ABSTRACT  TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - The effects of probucol, a lipophilic antioxidant, on the myocardial dysfunction (stunning) observed during reperfusion after 15-min ischemia in rabbit heart were  studied. Rabbits received food with or without 1% probucol for 3 weeks. They were  then anesthetized and prepared for recording of myocardial segment shortening,  arterial blood pressure (BP), left ventricular pressure (LVP), rate of  development of LVP (dP/dt), and a lead II ECG. Regional myocardial ischemia was  produced by acute occlusion of the first marginal branch of the left coronary  artery. Myocardial segment shortening was depressed after reperfusion in control  rabbits. In comparison, myocardial segment shortening was significantly greater  in probucol-treated rabbits than in control rabbits during reperfusion,  indicating a beneficial effect. No hemodynamic or ECG changes measured could  explain this difference. The number of premature ventricular contractions was  reduced in the probucol-treated group, although the incidence of ventricular  tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) were not. Concentrations of  probucol in serum and heart of five rabbits were 15.0 +/- 1.2 micrograms/ml and  17.5 +/- 2.5 micrograms/g (mean +/- SEM), respectively. Only probucol  concentrations in the serum were positively correlated with the improvement in  myocardial segment shortening (r = 0.91, p = 0.03). We conclude that a clinically  relevant serum concentration of probucol reduces ischemia-induced myocardial  stunning in the rabbit.

AB  - This preliminary study examined reno-vascular injury sustained by the multipapillary porcine kidney in acute and chronic complete ureteric obstruction.  In combination with measurement of upper tract pressure, regional function was  assessed by [99mTc]-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) uptake and qualitative renal  perfusion, by resin casting of the arterial tree prior to scanning electron  microscopy (SEM). In acute obstruction, segmental defects were noted in the renal  poles on both [99mTc]-DMSA scanning and casting. On SEM there was a polar  afferent arteriolar vasodilatation after 30 min of obstruction and, subsequently,  a segmental reduction in cortical perfusion. In kidneys that had been obstructed  for 20 days, we observed a marked reduction in outer cortical perfusion  coincident with afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction. The pathogenesis and  significance of segmental injury to the multipapillary kidney in obstructive  uropathy is discussed.

AB  - (S)-Emopamil is a novel calcium channel blocker of the phenylalkylamine class, with potent serotonin S2 antagonist activity. We investigated the effect of  (S)-emopamil on the histopathologic consequences of global brain ischemia in  anesthetized rats. Pretreated rats (n = 15) received 20 mg/kg i.p. (S)-emopamil  30 minutes before and 2 hours following 10 minutes of bilateral common carotid  artery occlusion plus arterial hypotension (50 mm Hg). Quantitative cell counts  following 3 days' survival revealed a marked loss of pyramidal neurons in all  subsectors of the hippocampal CA1 area of untreated ischemic rats (n = 15). In  contrast, in (S)-emopamil pretreated rats numbers of normal neurons were  significantly higher, by 2.4-, 1.9-, and 1.8-fold, respectively, in the medial,  middle, and lateral subsectors of the CA1 area. For example, normal neuron counts  in the medial CA1 subsector were 34 +/- 9 (mean +/- SEM) in untreated ischemic  rats compared with 82 +/- 13 in (S)-emopamil pretreated rats (control nonischemic  value [n = 5] 157 +/- 2). By semiquantitative grading, (S)-emopamil also  decreased ischemic changes in the cerebral cortex. No significant effect of  (S)-emopamil on ischemic injury was detected in rats treated beginning 30 minutes  after the ischemic insult (n = 10). Thus, pretreatment with (S)-emopamil is  beneficial in decreasing the severity of neuronal injury in global brain  ischemia.

AB  - Tissue plasminogen activator is an endogenous fibrin-specific serine protease with potent thrombolytic activity. We investigated the efficacy of tissue  plasminogen activator in reducing cerebral infarct size after thromboembolic  stroke in a rabbit model. Seventeen rabbits were randomized to receive either  tissue plasminogen activator (2.5 mg/kg, n = 6) or vehicle control (n = 11). We  controlled mean arterial pressure, hematocrit, and arterial blood gases before  and after the intracarotid embolization of an autologous clot. Cerebral blood  flow (cm3/100 g/min) (mean +/- SEM) was immediately reduced from 55.2 +/- 7.7 to  8.5 +/- 2.5 in the control group and from 61.8 +/- 14.8 to 10.0 +/- 3.5 in the  treated group after embolization. Cerebral blood flow recovered significantly  within 60 minutes of thrombolytic therapy and attained a value of 59.6 +/- 10.0  cm3/100 g/min 4 hours after embolization, whereas cerebral blood flow in control  animals demonstrated only a minimal recovery to 15.3 +/- 8.9 cm3/100 g/min.  Cerebral infarct size (percent of hemisphere) was reduced from 34.4 +/- 5.6% in  control animals to 8.8 +/- 5.6% in treated animals (mean +/- SEM, p less than  0.01). These results suggest that tissue plasminogen activator may be efficacious  in restoring cerebral blood flow and thus limiting infarct size in acute  thromboembolic stroke.

T2  - The Journal of trauma
AB  - Auto-PEEP (A-PEEP), unrecognized alveolar positive and expiratory pressure during mechanical ventilation, is an acknowledged hazard in patients with chronic  obstructive lung disease. We evaluated 50 consecutive trauma patients for the  presence of A-PEEP and its effect on hemodynamic stability. Injury Severity  Scores (ISS) were 8 to 41 (21 +/- 1); Revised Trauma Scores (RTS) ranged from 2.0  to 7.8 (6.2 +/- 0.2). Mode of ventilation was assist control, inspiratory flow  rates were 40 to 120 L/M (78 +/- 2). A-PEEP, determined in the non-assisting  patient by occluding the expiratory port at end exhalation, was present in 28  patients (56%) and ranged from 1 to 12 cm H2O (5.3 +/- 0.4 cm H2O). Data  segregated by A-PEEP versus no A-PEEP were as follows (Mean +/- SEM): [table: see  text] *P less than 0.05, VE = minute ventilation, Paw = mean airway pressure.  Upon reversal of A-PEEP in the eight patients with levels greater than 5 cm H2O,  mean blood pressure rose from 90 +/- 17 to 102 +/- 22 mm Hg and central venous  pressure fell from 13 +/- 5 to 7 +/- 5 mm Hg. A-PEEP was successfully treated in  these eight patients by increasing peak flows, minimizing VE requirements and  selective use of bronchodilators. In sum, the hypermetabolic ventilated trauma  patient should be monitored routinely for this common phenomenon which may have  profound cardiopulmonary effects in the setting of acute resuscitation.

AB  - The authors assessed absorption and motility of the human ileum after a prolonged period of disuse. In eight patients with ulcerative colitis, a  manometric-catheter assembly was placed via the ileostomy into the unused portion  of distal ileum two months after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis and temporary  diverting loop ileostomy. The distal ileum was perfused at 5 ml/min with an  isosmotic solution of either sodium chloride or ileal chyme diluted with sodium  chloride for three hours before and three hours after a meal on two consecutive  days. Absorption was measured, single and clustered pressure waves were  identified and quantitated with the aid of a computer program, and a motility  index was calculated. Mean absorption +/- S.E.M. of both perfusates was poor on  day 1 (-10 +/- 2 ml/25 cm x 30 min), and the meal induced no ileal motor  response. By day 2, however, absorption of both perfusates was much improved (-1  +/- 2 ml/25 cm x 30 min; P less than 0.05), and the number of discrete clustered  contractions and the motility index now clearly increased after the meal (2.6 +/-  0.6 vs. 7.2 +/- 1.0 clustered waves/hr; 7.5 +/- 0.5 vs. 9.7 +/- 0.2 motility  units/30 min; P less than 0.05). The conclusion was that absorption and motility  of the human ileum were impaired after two months of disuse, but that ileal  absorption and motility improved one day after the introduction of isosmotic  ileal perfusates.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare the degree of ischemic and hypoxic injury in normal versus hypertrophied rat hearts to investigate basic mechanisms  responsible for irreversible myocardial ischemic injury. Hearts from rats with  bands placed on the aortic arch at 23 days of age (BAND) and sham-operated rats  (SHAM, 8 weeks postoperative) were isolated, perfused with Krebs buffer, and had  a left ventricular balloon to measure developed pressure. Hearts were made  globally ischemic until they developed peak ischemic contracture and were  reperfused for 30 minutes. Additional hearts were perfused for 15 minutes with  glucose-free hypoxic buffer followed by 20 minutes of oxygenated perfusion. There  was an 87% increase in heart weight of BAND compared with SHAM (p less than  0.01). During ischemia, lactate levels increased faster in BAND compared with  SHAM, ischemic contracture occurred earlier in BAND than in SHAM despite no  difference in ATP levels, and postischemic recovery of left ventricular pressure  was less in BAND (26.8 +/- 5.6% of control left ventricular pressure, mean +/-  SEM) compared with SHAM (40 +/- 4.6%, p less than 0.05). During hypoxic  perfusion, lactate release was greater in BAND than in SHAM (48.8 +/- 1.2 versus  26.6 +/- 0.97 mumols/g, p less than 0.01), and with reoxygenation, lactate  dehydrogenase release was less in BAND than in SHAM (13.2 +/- 0.7 versus 19.5 +/-  0.2 IU/g, p less than 0.01). After hypoxia and reoxygenation, left ventricular  pressure recovery was greater in BAND than in SHAM (93 +/- 8.4% versus 66 +/-  5.3%, p less than 0.01). Thus, this study suggests that hypertrophied hearts have  a greater potential for glycolytic metabolism, resulting in an increased rate of  by-product accumulation during ischemia, which may be responsible for the  increased susceptibility of hypertrophied hearts to ischemic injury.

AB  - We assessed the effect of previous abdominal colectomy on functional results after ileal "J" pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) in patients with ulcerative  colitis. Twenty-five patients with colectomy prior to IPAA were compared with 22  patients who underwent noncolonic abdominal operations prior to IPAA. No  differences were observed in pre- or postoperative resting anal sphincter  pressure, squeeze pressure, or rectal inhibitory reflex. Previous colectomy was  associated with a greater incidence of postoperative small bowel obstruction.  Mean +/- SEM daily stool frequency at 1 and 12 months postoperatively,  respectively, was 8.9 +/- 0.8 and 5.7 +/- 0.3 for patients who had undergone  previous colectomy, and 8.2 +/- 0.7 and 6.0 +/- 0.5 for the no-previous colectomy  group (p = not significant). At the same postoperative intervals, nocturnal stool  frequency was 1.9 +/- 0.3 and 1.1 +/- 0.2 for the colectomy group and 1.5 +/- 0.3  and 0.6 +/- 0.1 for the no colectomy group (p = 0.05 at 1 year). More patients in  the previous colectomy group had greater than or equal to 1 nocturnal stool after  1 year (71% versus 33%, p = 0.03). Although pouch capacity at 1 year was not  different in the 2 groups, pouch capacity was directly related to stool frequency  in the no colectomy group (r2 = 0.48, p = 0.01), but not in the previous  colectomy group (r2 = 0.08, p = not significant). We conclude that previous  abdominal colectomy may be associated with a higher overall incidence of small  bowel obstruction. Moreover, previous colectomy is a determinant of postoperative  nocturnal stool frequency after IPAA, most likely due to altered ileal pouch  function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

T2  - The Journal of surgical research
AB  - Limiting the rate of reperfusion blood flow following prolonged ischemia in skeletal muscle has been shown beneficial. However, the persistence of this  benefit with reinstitution of normal blood flow remains undefined. We  investigated the role of temporary limited reperfusion on ischemia-reperfusion  injury in an isolated gracilis muscle model in six anesthetized dogs. Both  gracilis muscles were subjected to 6 hr of ischemia followed by 2 hr of  reperfusion. Reperfusion blood flow was limited for the first hour in one  gracilis muscle to its preischemic rate followed by a second hour of normal  reperfusion (LR/NR). The contralateral muscle underwent 2 hr of normal  reperfusion (NR/NR). Muscle injury was quantified by technetium-99m pyrophosphate  (TcPyp) uptake and by histochemical staining using triphenyltetrazolium chloride  (TTC) with planimetry of the infarct size. Capillary permeability was evaluated  by muscle weight gain. Results are reported as the mean +/- SEM: [table: see  text] These data demonstrate a sustained benefit from temporary limited  reperfusion. This methodology should be considered in the surgical management of  the acutely ischemic limb.

TI  - Pericardial prostaglandin biosynthesis prevents the increased incidence of reperfusion-induced ventricular fibrillation produced by efferent sympathetic  stimulation in dogs.
AU  - Miyazaki, T.
AU  - Zipes, D. P.
T2  - Circulation
AB  - This study tested the hypothesis that sympathetic neural stimulation increases the prevalence of reperfusion-induced ventricular fibrillation and explored the  mechanisms by which this occurs and how it may be prevented. In anesthetized,  autonomically denervated dogs, we examined the effects of bilateral ansae  subclaviae stimulation (SS) and of induction of pericardial biosynthesis of  prostaglandins, an intervention that reduces SS effects by acting at presynaptic  sites. A 5-minute occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery  distal to the first or second diagonal branch was performed during SS. Heart rate  was maintained constant by atrial pacing. In the absence of SS, one of 23 dogs  developed ventricular fibrillation during occlusion, and three of the remaining  22 dogs developed ventricular fibrillation upon reperfusion. SS did not increase  the prevalence of occlusion-induced ventricular fibrillation (four of 23 dogs)  but increased the prevalence of reperfusion-induced ventricular fibrillation (12  of the remaining 19 dogs, p = 0.01). SS did not affect occlusion-induced decrease  in local electrogram amplitude recorded from the ischemic myocardium or  myocardial blood flow to the ischemic myocardium during occlusion or reperfusion.  SS, however, prevented occlusion-induced increase in diastolic excitability  threshold. Instillation into the pericardial cavity of arachidonic acid solution  (3 micrograms/ml) resulted in release of prostacyclin, measured by  radioimmunoassay as a stable metabolite 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha (63.1 +/-  11.3 ng/ml, n = 11, mean +/- SEM), and of prostaglandin E2 (7.0 +/- 0.9 ng/ml, n  = 11). This pericardial solution blunted SS-induced increase in mean arterial  blood pressure and reduced the prevalence of ventricular fibrillation during  reperfusion (six dogs to one dog, p less than 0.05). Blood flow to the ischemic  myocardium remained unaffected. Indomethacin, when added to the solution (3  micrograms/ml), reversed the effects of prostaglandin release and arrhythmia  development. These data indicate that efferent sympathetic stimulation during a  coronary occlusion and reperfusion sequence increases the prevalence of  reperfusion-induced ventricular fibrillation that is reduced by pericardial  biosynthesis of prostaglandins. Pericardial prostaglandin synthesis may serve as  a unique antiarrhythmic function by regulating efferent cardiac sympathetic nerve  effects.

T2  - The Journal of clinical investigation
AB  - Acute ultraviolet light B (UVB) injury is associated with dermal mast cell histamine release. The possibility that histamine-stimulated prostaglandin (PG)  synthesis could be a mechanism for irradiation erythema was therefore examined  using human skin explants. Explants responded to UV irradiation (120 mJ/cm2) with  a fivefold increase in synthesis of prostaglandins E2, F2 alpha and 6-keto PGF1  alpha. Incubating explants with the H1 antihistamines brompheniramine (50 microM)  or pyrilamine (30 microM) inhibited PG release from irradiated explants 63 +/-  4.9% (mean +/- SEM) 6 h after UV exposure. Antihistamines did not affect PG  synthesis in control explants. Irradiation increased the histamine concentration  in explant conditioned medium only 50% over basal values, suggesting that  irradiation enhanced histamine responsiveness. Explants were therefore incubated  with exogenous histamine. In irradiated explants, PG synthesis was stimulated  threefold by 3 microM histamine. Unirradiated explants' PG synthesis was  unaffected by histamine. Enhanced histamine sensitivity was also examined in  epidermal cell cultures. In irradiated cultures, histamine sensitivity was again  markedly potentiated: as little as 1 microM histamine stimulated significant PGE2  release and the response to 10-30 microM histamine was increased six to eight  times compared with that of unirradiated cultures. These studies demonstrate that  endogenous histamine stimulates PG synthesis in human skin after UV injury by  potentiation of histamine-induced prostaglandin release. Potentiated agonist  responses induced by UV exposure may contribute to the effects of UVB irradiation  injury and in particular to irradiation erythema.

AB  - Na,K-ATPase concentration was measured by vanadate facilitated 3H-ouabain binding to intact samples taken from various parts of porcine and canine myocardium. In  porcine and canine heart 3H-ouabain binding site concentration in ventricles was  1.4-2.5 times larger than in atria. Evaluation of 3H-ouabain binding kinetics  revealed no major difference between atria and ventricles: Equilibrium was  obtained after the same incubation time in right atrium (RA) as in left ventricle  (LV), both in porcine and canine heart. Unspecific uptake and retention of  3H-ouabain was for porcine heart RA and LV 1.5 and 1.4, respectively, and for  canine heart RA and LV, both 1.2% filling (i.e., volume (ml) of incubation medium  3H-radioactivity taken up per mass unit (g wet wt.) of tissue multiplied by 100).  The apparent dissociation constant (KD) was 1.4 x 10(-8) and 1.9 x 10(-8) in  porcine RA and LV and 2.6 x 10(-8) and 6.1 x 10(-8) mol/l in canine RA and LV.  Loss of specifically bound 3H-ouabain during the washout procedure occurred with  a half-life time (T1/2) of 16.7 and 28.6 in RA and LV of porcine heart and 91.2  and 151.6 h in RA and LV of canine heart. Duly corrected for these errors of the  method--factor 1.16 and 1.13, respectively, for porcine RA and LV, and factor  1.11 and 1.13 for canine RA and LV, total 3H-ouabain binding site concentration  was found to be 553 +/- 74 and 1037 +/- 45 pmol/g wet wt. (means +/- SEM, n = 5)  in porcine RA and LV, and 569 +/- 37 and 1410 +/- 40 pmol/g wet wt. (means +/-  SEM, n = 5) in the canine RA and LV. These values were confirmed by measurements  of 3H-digoxin binding to the porcine heart. The present quantification of  myocardial Na,K-ATPase gives values up to 154 times higher than measurements  based upon Na,K-ATPase activities in membrane fractions where the recovery of  Na,K-ATPase may be less than 1% due to loss during purification. A higher  Na,K-ATPase concentration is found in small animals than in large animals. A  relationship between higher concentration of Na,K-ATPase and larger pressure work  in ventricles compared to atria is suggested. Myocardial 3H-ouabain binding sites  were found to be stable for 20 min of ischemia, followed by 1 h of reperfusion,  supporting the concept that myocyte injury induced by short term ischemia may be  reversible and that reperfusion may result in normalization.

AB  - Over a 2-year period we observed three cases of unilateral suppression of the electroencephalogram (EEG) lasting from 45 s to 4 min following intracarotid  injection of 60% iothalamate meglumine (Conray) for intraoperative carotid  angiography postendarterectomy. As a result of these cases we undertook studies  in 11 dogs anesthetized with isoflurane to examine causes of EEG suppression  following intracarotid contrast medium injection. In group 1 (n = 6) cerebral  blood flow (CBF), the cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (CMRO2), EEG activity,  and permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) were determined. In group 2 (n  = 5) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure, EEG activity, and BBB permeability were  determined. Intracarotid injection of 5 ml of 60% Conray was associated with  unilateral EEG suppression and increased BBB permeability in 1 of 11 dogs.  Injection of contrast material caused no change in CBF or CMRO2 and caused a  statistically significant but physiologically unimportant increase of CSF  pressure (from 12 +/- 1 to 16 +/- 1 cm H2O, mean +/- SEM). It is concluded that  EEG suppression following intracarotid injection of Conray is a rare event. It  seems unlikely that EEG suppression resulted from cerebral ischemia or hypoxia,  but rather was associated with increased BBB permeability. Increased BBB  permeability likely was caused by the osmotic effect of Conray and not by  hypoxic-ischemic microvascular injury or loss of autoregulation of CBF.

TI  - Species differences in susceptibility to ischemic injury and responsiveness to myocardial protection.
AU  - Galiñanes, M.

AB  - Isolated hearts from rabbits, hamsters, ferrets, gerbils, rats, mice and guinea pigs were used to investigate species differences in (i) stability during aerobic  perfusion, (ii) susceptibility to ischemic injury and (iii) responsiveness to  cardioplegic protection. During 120 minutes of continuous aerobic perfusion, the  rate of functional deterioration differed between species. The rabbit was the  most stable and the guinea pig the least: the mean +/- SEM of the left  ventricular developed pressure falling, after 120 minutes of perfusion, to 82 +/-  4% and 60 +/- 6%, respectively. In studies with 30 minutes of ischemia and 60  minutes of reperfusion, the developed pressure recovered to 72 +/- 2, 71 +/- 2,  65 +/- 3, 64 +/- 2, 58 +/- 3, 50 +/- 8 and 50 +/- 2% of its pre-ischemic value in  the rabbit, hamster, ferret, gerbil, rat, mouse and guinea pig, respectively.  With 60 minutes of ischemia, the recovery of developed pressure in the guinea  pig, rabbit, rat, mouse, hamster, ferret and gerbil was 5 +/- 1, 19 +/- 2, 22 +/-  3, 30 +/- 5, 55 +/- 4, 60 +/- 2 and 45 +/- 5%, respectively. Creatine kinase  leakage and changes in tissue metabolite content generally reflected the degree  of functional injury. In further studies, groups of 6 hearts were infused for 2  minutes with St. Thomas' Hospital Cardioplegic Solution, then subjected to 30  minutes of ischemia. Cardioplegia improved the recovery of developed pressure in  the rabbit, hamster, gerbil, rat and mouse (from 72 +/- 2, 71 +/- 2, 64 +/- 2, 58  +/- 3 and 50 +/- 8% to 82 +/- 3, 103 +/- 3, 84 +/- 4, 77 +/- 2 and 78 +/- 5%,  respectively; p less than 0.05 for each species). However, no protection was  observed in the ferret and guinea pig (65 +/- 3 and 50 +/- 2% versus 66 +/- 3 and  47 +/- 6%, respectively; p = NS). With cardioplegia, tissue high-energy  phosphates increased significantly in all species except the gerbil. Rat and  guinea pig hearts were taken for time-response studies (ischemia for 15, 20, 30,  45, 50 and 60 minutes in the rat and 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes in the guinea pig)  with or without cardioplegia. In the rat, cardioplegia improved recovery over an  ischemic time-window of 20-45 minutes, but in the guinea pig no improvement was  detected. Creatine kinase leakage reflected the patterns of functional recovery.  In contrast, high-energy phosphates were preserved better in both species after  30 minutes of ischemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

AB  - The effects of oral zofenopril pretreatment were investigated in a chronic closed-chest pig model of ischemia and reperfusion. Pigs (25-35 kg) were  pretreated orally with zofenopril (15 mg/day) on the 2 days prior to ischemia,  which was evoked by the inflation of a catheter balloon in the left anterior  descending coronary artery over 45 minutes. The catheter was then removed and the  myocardium was reperfused. After 2 weeks, infarct properties were assessed by  signal averaging of the body surface electrocardiogram and the inducibility of  malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias was tested with a programmed electrical  stimulation protocol. A significant increase in the pressure-rate product (43 +/-  11%, mean +/- SEM), indicating the oxygen demand of the heart, was prevented by  zofenopril (19 +/- 8%, p less than 0.05). Zofenopril reduced the peak efflux of  adrenaline (1302 +/- 213 vs. 3201 +/- 760 pg/ml; p less than 0.05), noradrenaline  (402 +/- 54 vs. 902 +/- 282 pg/ml; p less than 0.05), and of the adenosine  catabolites inosine and hypoxanthine (56 +/- 4 vs. 78 +/- 9, pg/ml; p less than  0.05) in the coronary venous effluent. The efflux of the cytoplasmatic enzyme  creatine phosphokinase was not significantly reduced after zofenopril (p = 0.08).  No difference in plasma renin levels between the groups were found. After 2  weeks, late potentials were found only in the surviving animals from the  untreated group, i.e., the voltage vector magnitude was more reduced, and a  prolongation of the QRS duration and of the terminal low-amplitude part of the  high-frequency QRS were found.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - To elucidate the mechanism of contractile dysfunction in postischemic ("stunned") myocardium, time-resolved measurements of intracellular free Ca2+ concentration  ([Ca2+]i) were made using gated 19F nuclear magnetic resonance in seven perfused  ferret hearts loaded with the fluorinated Ca2+ indicator 5F-BAPTA. Left  ventricular developed pressure decreased to 65 +/- 3% (mean +/- SEM) of control  after 15 minutes of global ischemia at 37 degrees C. In stunned myocardium,  diastolic [Ca2+]i (0.24 +/- 0.03 microM) was not changed from control (0.18 +/-  0.03 microM, p greater than 0.10), but peak [Ca2+]i (1.03 +/- 0.13 microM) was  paradoxically higher than that in control (0.61 +/- 0.06 microM, p less than  0.02). The slope of the relation between developed pressure and Ca2+ transient  amplitude in stunned myocardium was significantly lower than that in control (p  less than 0.05), even after normalization by maximal Ca2(+)-activated pressure.  These results indicate that contractile failure in stunned myocardium is due to a  decrease in the myofilament sensitivity to Ca2+ as well as to the previously  identified decrease in maximal Ca2(+)-activated force; failure of activator Ca2+  delivery cannot be implicated. The increase in the amplitude of Ca2+ transients  would require that more ATP be spent in Ca2+ sequestration; thus, decreased  efficiency of energy utilization in stunned myocardium would result.

AB  - Polymorphonuclear granulocytes PMN) are suggested mediators of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. We have previously shown that activated PMN  producing oxygen free radicals (OFR) in the coronary circulation are  cardiodepressive. OFR may induce lipid peroxidation and production of  eicosanoids. We have investigated the influence of cyclo-oxygenase and  lipoxygenase inhibitors on the effects of activated, OFR producing PMN in the  Langedorff rat heart model. Left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) was  measured by a balloon in the left ventricle. Human PMN and drugs were given into  the aortic cannula for 10 min and the hearts were observed for 30 min thereafter.  After infusion for 5 min OFR production in the cellular infusate was measured at  the level of the aortic cannula by a chemiluminescence (CL) technique. Phorbol  12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-activated PMN (n = 8), produced a CL response of  27649 +/- 11048 counts (mean +/- S.E.M.), and reduced coronary flow (CF) to 53  +/- 6% (mean +/- S.E.M.) and LVDP to 38 +/- 9% of baseline values at the end of  the observation period. Ibuprofen (n = 6), a cyclooxygenase (CO) inhibitor,  neither influenced the CL response (31915 +/- 7563) of activated PMN, nor the  reduction of CF and LVDP at this time. Although both BW 755C (n = 7), a dual  inhibitor of CO and lipoxygenase (LO) (CF:90 +/- 4%, LVDP:99 +/- 6%) and  diethylcarbamazine (DCM) (n = 8), a LO inhibitor (CF:88 +/- 11%, LVDP:87 +/- 4%),  significantly inhibited the cardiodepressive effects of activated PMN. BW 755C  alone abolished the CL response (431 +/- 158 counts), whereas DCM had no effect  on CL (30105 +/- 1698 counts).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - Small-volume resuscitation (4 ml/kg) with hypertonic saline-dextran (HSD) has been shown effective in hemorrhagic shock. In the present study the effectiveness  of an initial 4 ml/kg bolus infusion of HSD on cardiovascular function and fluid  resuscitation requirements after a major burn injury was evaluated in  anesthetized sheep following a 40% BSA scald burn. One hour after injury  resuscitation was initiated by a rapid intravenous bolus infusion (4 ml/kg) of  either hypertonic saline-dextran (7.5% NaCl in 6% dextran 70) (HSD) or the same  volume of normal (isotonic) saline (NS). Lactated Ringer's was later infused as  needed to maintain cardiac output at 90% of baseline. HSD rapidly and effectively  restored cardiac output and mean arterial pressure significantly better than the  same volume of NS. Hemodynamic improvement by HSD was short lived, and need for  further fluid therapy was only marginally delayed (HSD 38 +/- 8 min, NS 20 +/- 3  min; p = 0.06) (mean +/- SEM). The total requirements for fluid therapy during  the first 6 hr postburn were not reduced by the initial HSD bolus (HSD 3,145 +/-  605 ml, NS 2,905 +/- 495 ml; n.s.), nor was skin edema formation reduced. We  conclude that in anesthetized sheep HSD resuscitation was only transiently  effective in treating burn shock. This may be attributed to the sustained  increase in vascular permeability and continued plasma leak following thermal  injury.

AB  - 1. To dissociate the effects on the development of diabetic renal injury of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition per se, and a reduction in  systemic blood pressure, we have studied the effects of chronic ramapril  treatment in streptozotocin diabetic spontaneously hypertensive rats, with  modulation of the hypotensive effect by a high salt diet. 2. Three weeks  following uninephrectomy and induction of diabetes with streptozotocin,  spontaneously hypertensive rats were allocated to three treatment groups. Groups  1 and 2 received 1% sodium chloride and Group 3 water as drinking solution.  Groups 2 and 3 received 0.4 mg/kg per day ramapril in drinking solution over the  subsequent 2 month study period. 3. Sodium chloride drinking solution (1%)  completely prevented any hypotensive effect of ramapril. Blood pressure was  reduced in Group 3 rats over the entire period of study, when compared with Group  2 rats (P less than 0.001). 4. Urinary protein excretion progressively increased  in Group 1 and 2 rats, and was significantly reduced (P less than 0.001) in Group  3. After 2 months treatment, urinary protein (expressed as mean and s.e.m.) was  160 +/- 30 mg/day in Group 1, 240 +/- 50 mg/day in Group 2, and 60 +/- 11 mg/day  in Group 3. 5. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition per se was not associated  with a reduced protein excretion in diabetic nephropathy, requiring concomitant  control of systemic blood pressure to become renoprotective.

AB  - 1. Calcium-entry blockers increase the intramyocardial pH and decrease the intramyocardial Pco2 of ischaemic canine myocardium. However, the evidence  documenting improvements in myocardial acidosis and in myocardial resuscitability  after administration of calcium-entry blockers during cardiac arrest is  incomplete. We therefore compared the effects of verapamil (0.05 mg/kg) and  diltiazem (0.075 mg/kg) with those of saline placebo in an established porcine  model of cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. 2. After verapamil,  six of 11 animals were successfully resuscitated; after diltiazem, five of 10;  and after saline placebo, six of 10. Coronary perfusion and mean aortic pressures  together with end-tidal CO2 concentration during precordial compression were  predictive of resuscitation, independently of the drug or placebo. 3. Coronary  vein pH decreased to 6.91 +/- 0.06 units (mean +/- SEM) with concurrent increases  in PCO2 to levels exceeding 100 mmHg. Coronary vein lactate increased to a  maximum of 7.5 +/- 0.6 mmol/l. Coronary vein acidaemia was accompanied by  decreases in intramyocardial pH to 6.64 +/- 0.06 units. However, each of these  differences between success and failure of resuscitation was unrelated to  treatment with calcium-entry blockers. 4. Accordingly, neither verapamil nor  diltiazem selectively altered coronary perfusion pressure, attenuated  intramyocardial acidosis or improved resuscitability after porcine cardiac arrest  and cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

AB  - The retinal vessel calibre responses to systemic sympathetic stimulation, were studied in nine patients (eight male; mean age: 31.7 years; range: 19-58 years)  with unilateral disruption of their cervical sympathetic tract. All patients had  ipsilateral decreased/absent facial sweating and a Horners syndrome, evidence of  unilateral sympathetic denervation. Both eyes of each patient were studied and  the results were analysed in two groups: the group of nine sympathectomised eyes  and the control group of unaffected fellow eyes. During handgrip contraction  there was a significant difference in the mean retinal arteriolar constriction  (mean +/- SEM) between the group of sympathectomised eyes (4.6 +/- 0.89%) and  control eyes (7.1 +/- 1.13%), p less than 0.01. Similarly, there was a  significant difference in mean venule constriction during sustained handgrip  contraction between the group of sympathectomised eyes (1.5 +/- 0.67%) and  control eyes (4.9 +/- 0.98%), p less than 0.05. There was no significant  difference in the mean rise in diastolic blood pressure between the two groups:  control eyes +27.9 +/- 2.38 mmHg and sympathectomised eyes +27.8 +/- 2.25 mmHg.  There was no correlation between the blood pressure and retinal vessel responses  in either group. These results suggest that the sympathetic nervous system plays  an integral role in retinal blood flow regulation.

AB  - We used isolated rat hearts subjected to coronary artery ligation and reperfusion to study the antiarrhythmic activity of 5-hydroxypropafenone (5OHP) and  N-depropylpropafenone (NDPP), major metabolites of propafenone (P) in humans, and  of the two enantiomers (R)- and (S)-propafenone. 5OHP suppressed reperfusion  arrhythmias similar to the parent drug in a concentration-dependent manner. The  concentration of 5OHP needed to prevent ventricular fibrillation in 50% of  experiments (EC50) was significantly higher than that of P (0.186 +/- 0.05 vs.  0.153 +/- 0.005 mg/L, mean +/- SEM, p less than 0.05). 5OHP had a relative  potency of 80% compared to P. When 5OHP and P were administered together, their  antiarrhythmic effect appeared to be supra-additive. The NDPP metabolite showed  very little antiarrhythmic potency and was about four times less active than P.  The two enantiomers (R) and (S) were equipotent and showed antiarrhythmic  activities similar to racemic P.

AB  - A comparison, based on results from anal manometry and continence, was made between eight patients after circular stapled ileal J-pouch-anal anastomosis  without mucosectomy (Js) and seven patients after endoanal mucosal proctectomy  and hand-sewn ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (Jm). The mean and range from  ileostomy closure were 3.5 months (1.5 to 12) and 21.7 months (13 to 32),  respectively. The mean maximum resting pressure (MRP) ( +/- SEM and range) was  81.3 mm Hg ( +/- 6.0 and 61 to 112.5) and 50.0 mm Hg ( +/- 6.2 and 17 to 62.5),  respectively, for the Js and Jm groups (P less than .003). None of the Js  patients experienced leakage or wore a pad, while in the Jm group 14 percent  experienced minor leakage during the day and 28 percent at night. Seventy-one  percent of the Jm group wore a pad at some point. Anal sphincter resting  pressures and continence were better in the Js group. The improvement in MRP  resulted from avoidance of injury to the internal and sphincter during dilatation  and mucosectomy and the maintenance of a normal anal canal that allowed for  proper closure.

AB  - Damaged arterial surfaces initiate platelet accumulation which leads to thrombus formation. On artificial surfaces, albumin pretreatment inhibits platelet  deposition. To investigate albumin pretreatment on damaged vessel surfaces, 16  carotid arteries were obtained from 8 anesthetized dogs (11-15 kg). Each artery  was divided into 2 segments. Each segment was mounted in a perfusion system,  distended to 100 mmHg, and the middle section damaged. One segment was perfused  with Tyrodes solution plus bovine albumin (5 g/100 ml), while the other segment  was perfused only with Tyrodes solution. After 120 mins, both segments were  perfused with whole citrated blood containing Indium-111 labeled platelets.  Without albumin pretreatment, the proximal section contained 11 +/- 8 (X +/- SEM)  percent of total blood radioactivity, while the damaged section contained 53 +/-  11 percent (p less than 0.01). Albumin pretreatment significantly reduced  platelet deposition in the damaged section (53 +/- 11 versus 9 +/- 6 percent, p  less than 0.01). Further, with albumin pretreatment the radioactive counts in the  damaged section were not significantly different from the nondamaged proximal  section (9 +/- 6 vs 8 +/- 7 percent, p greater than .8). Quantitative examination  of the scanning electron micrographs demonstrated significantly more platelet and  red blood cell coverage of the damaged segments (60 +/- 12.8 percent) than of the  albumin treated segments (12.9 +/- 5 percent). In four additional experiments, we  pretreated arterial segments with albumin for varying time intervals. After 15,  30 and 60 mins of albumin pretreatment, each artery was perfused with  radiolabeled platelets and whole blood for 5 mins at 100 mmHg perfusion pressure.  Radioactive evidence of platelet deposition on arterial segments treated with  albumin for 15, 30, and 60 minutes was also significantly less than control (p  less than .05). Beneficial effects of albumin were apparent up to 30 mins of  blood flow at 100 mm Hg. Our results suggest that albumin may inhibit platelet  and red blood cell deposition on damaged arteries. This could be an adjunct  therapy for vessel preservation during artery bypass procedures.

T2  - Chest
AB  - In 23 mechanically ventilated anuric (six) or oliguric (17) patients (less than 16 ml/h of urine output) with severe gas exchange abnormality, we investigated  the effect of furosemide on intrapulmonary shunt (Qs/QT). Before and after 0.5,  1, and 2 h of IV administration of 200 mg of furosemide, we assessed the  intrapulmonary shunt and PaO2 while patients' hemodynamic measurements were  monitored. Ventilatory parameters remained constant throughout the study. While  the urine output was minimal and no alteration in hemodynamic values was found,  the Qs/QT decreased from 27.7 +/- 2.3 percent (mean +/- SEM) at control to 24.3  +/- 2.1 percent (p less than 0.01) at 0.5 h, 21.7 +/- 2.1 percent (p less than  0.001) at 1 h, and 18.1 +/- 1.8 percent (p less than 0.001) at 2 h. The PaO2  showed no significant difference at 0.5 h but rose significantly from 96 +/- 14  to 105 +/- 14 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) and 111 +/- 14 mm Hg (p less than 0.01) at  1 and 2 h, respectively. Since we observed no changes in hemodynamics, we  speculate a direct effect of furosemide in the pulmonary vasculature affecting  the ventilation-perfusion mismatch and, therefore, the Qs/QT and PaO2.

T2  - The British journal of surgery
AB  - Minor difficulties with continence may occur after low anterior resection. Intraoperative injury to the internal anal sphincter or its nerve supply may  contribute to this. To study the effect of low anterior resection on the anal  sphincter mechanism, anal manometry was performed on 20 patients before and 10  days after resection. Fifteen patients were studied again 6 months after  operation. Resting, maximum squeeze and squeeze increment pressures were  recorded. Intraoperative manometry (n = 11) and presacral nerve stimulation (n =  6) were performed to determine whether peroperative injury to the internal anal  sphincter had occurred. Resting and maximum squeeze anal canal pressures were  reduced by low anterior resection, and did not recover. The squeeze pressure  increment did not change. Division of the inferior mesenteric artery, full  mobilization of the rectum and mesorectum, and rectal transection did not affect  resting anal pressure, which was reduced after EEA anastomosis (mean (s.e.m.)  before, 40(5) mmHg; after, 27(4) mmHg; P less than 0.05, n = 5). Presacral nerve  stimulation produced relaxation of the internal sphincter. Anal sphincter  pressures are reduced after low anterior resection. The external anal sphincter  and the nerve supply to the internal anal sphincter appear intact. A direct  injury to the internal sphincter is postulated.

TI  - [Cardiovascular and pulmonary changes in patients with an isolated cerebral lesion. II. Extravascular lung water and pulmonary gas exchange ("neurogenic lung  edema")].
AU  - Singbartl, G.
T2  - Der Anaesthesist
AB  - While in animal experiments neurogenically initiated pulmonary edema is a well known event and is supposed to be due to centrally initiated hemodynamic  disturbances ("neurohemodynamics") in patients with severe cerebral lesions  fulminant alveolar edema is reported to occur very rarely. The questions  addressed by this study are: 1. whether and to what extent changes in  extravascular lung water (EVTVL) can be demonstrated in patients with a severe  isolated cerebral lesion; 2. whether a relationship between the severity of the  cerebral lesion and accompanying EVTVL changes can be proven; and 3. whether or  not EVTVL changes are associated with corresponding changes in intravascular  hydrostatic and oncotic Starling parameters; i.e. cardiogenic or noncardiogenic  pulmonary edema accompanying the cerebral lesion. This study included 44 patients  presenting with a severe isolated cerebral lesion and decerebrate posturing on  admission. EVTVL (by thermo-dye double-indicator technique), pulmonary gas  exchange (AaDO2/pAO2), colloid oncotic pressure (COP) and mean systemic arterial  (SAP), mean pulmonary arterial (PAP), and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures  (PCWP) were measured from the day of admission to the 6th day after the acute  cerebral lesion maximally; in addition the microvascular pressure in the  pulmonary bed and intravascular filtration pressure were calculated from the  above mentioned parameters. The neurological status on admission and throughout  the observation period was scored using the Innsbruck Coma Scale (ICS) and the  neurological outcome by the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). Statistical analysis was  performed using the distribution independent Kruskal Wallis test, the correlation  coefficient r (Pearsan and Bravais), and the Spearman rank correlation (RSp);  values are given as means +/- SEM; the significance has been set at P less than  0.05. Our results reveal an overall increase in EVTVL from 8.8 +/- 0.8 ml/kg on  the day of admission up to 11.3 +/- 1.6 ml/kg on the 4th day. While survivors (n  = 13) remained within the normal range of EVTVL (less than 9 ml/kg),  non-survivors (n = 31) started at an already elevated level (10.05 +/- 1.04  ml/kg) and reached their maximum values (15.4 +/- 2.3 ml/kg) on day 3 to 4. In 3  non-survivors these increased initial EVTVL values were accompanied by  pathologically increased intravascular pressures, indicating that hydrostatic  mechanisms were involved in the EVTVL rises. While the hydrostatic pressures  normalized spontaneously, EVTVL values stayed within the pathological range  throughout the remaining observation period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

TI  - Intracranial pressure changes during positioning of patients with severe head injury.
AU  - Lee, S. T.
T2  - Heart & lung : the journal of critical care
AB  - To understand the effect of positioning of patients on intracranial pressure, studies were performed in 30 patients with head injuries severe enough to produce  prolonged coma with Glasgow Coma Scale scores less than 8. Intracranial pressure  was measured with the patient in four different positions: head at 0 degrees,  head down 30 degrees, three fourths supine, and three fourths prone without  turning the head. Intracranial pressure results were as follows: at 0 degrees,  20.50 +/- 1.75 (mean +/- SEM) mm Hg; head down 30 degrees, 24.15 +/- 1.75 mm Hg;  three fourths supine, 28.83 +/- 2.69 mm Hg; and three fourths prone 30.85 +/-  2.90 mm Hg. Intracranial pressures were higher in the latter three positions as  compared with the standard 0 degrees supine position, but some individual  differences in response were noted. The data suggest that the head-down,  three-fourths supine, and three-fourths prone positions have a greater chance of  increasing the intracranial pressure in patients with severe head injury having  prolonged comas. When patients are placed in the above three postures the  duration should be as short as possible, and they should be used only when  absolutely necessary.

AU  - Kjaeve, J.

AU  - Bjertnaes, L.
T2  - Circulatory shock
AB  - Reactive oxygen intermediates such as free radicals have been proposed to mediate lung injury. The present work examined whether or not enzymatically generated  oxygen metabolites altered serotonin clearance. Isolated, plasma-perfused rat  lungs were exposed to xanthine oxidase (XO) and hypoxanthine (HX). Pulmonary  arterial pressure (Ppa) and lung weight were recorded. Fulminant edema was  defined as a spontaneous weight increase exceeding 500 mg. Inactivation of  serotonin was determined by superfusion bioassay. XO and HX reduced serotonin  inactivation from 74 +/- 3% (mean +/- SEM) to 62 +/- 2%. This reduction was  inhibited by the scavenger enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase and by  allopurinol, an inhibitor of XO. Hydrostatic edema and perfusion per se did not  decrease the pulmonary clearance of serotonin. XO and HX did not significantly  alter Ppa. Fulminant edema developed in four of six lungs after exposure to XO  and HX compared with none in the other groups. It was concluded that reactive  oxygen intermediates inhibited serotonin inactivation in isolated rat lungs.

TI  - Beneficial effects of oxypurinol pretreatment in stunned, reperfused canine myocardium.
AU  - Holzgrefe, H. H.
AU  - Gibson, J. K.
T2  - Cardiovascular research
AB  - The mechanism of reperfusion induced injury in acutely ischaemic myocardium is controversial but may be connected with oxygen free radical generation. However,  chronic allopurinol treatment has beneficial effects in ischaemic myocardium  which are not due to its inhibition of xanthine oxidase induced oxygen free  radical production. Allopurinol is rapidly metabolised to oxypurinol, so we have  examined the effects of this compound on nutrient blood flow and contractility in  a canine model of stunned, reperfused myocardium. Twenty anaesthetised dogs  underwent 15 min of total circumflex artery occlusion followed by 15 min  restricted reflow and 2 h full reflow. Posterior wall thickening was determined  by sonomicrometry and expressed as % control function. Regional myocardial blood  flow was measured by microsphere technique and expressed in ml.min-1.g-1. Dogs in  the treatment group (n = 10) received 25 mg.kg-1 oxypurinol as a 5 min left  atrial infusion, 15 min prior to circumflex occlusion. Controls (n = 10) received  a saline infusion. During occlusion mean circumflex pressure (17.6 v 18.2 mm Hg),  endocardial flow [0.02(SEM 0.01) v 0.03(0.01) ml.min-1g-1], and area at risk  [31.4(1.2%) v 34.6(2.4%)] were similar for both groups (control v treated  respectively). Endocardial blood flow increased following acute administration of  oxypurinol: 1.57(0.15) v 0.92(0.15) ml.min-1g-1 in control (vehicle) group, p  less than 0.05. This effect persisted for the duration of the experiment, with a  significant increase during early reflow: 1.83(0.32) v 0.74(.21), p = 0.03. There  was also a marked increase in posterior wall function in the treated group, at  54.6(5.5)% v 5.1(8.4)% in the control group (p = 0.0003). These results show that  pretreatment with oxypurinol protects acutely ischaemic myocardium, producing  enhanced myocardial blood flow, diminished systolic bulge during occlusion, and  markedly enhanced function recovery following reperfusion.

AB  - The technique of proctocolectomy and formation of an ileal reservoir with ileoanal anastomosis is well described. It is believed that the conservation of a  rectal muscular cuff is necessary for continence but no data are available to  support this contention. The aims of this study were to describe the clinical and  physiological aspects of continence after proctocolectomy and ileal J pouch  anastomosis without conservation of a rectal muscular cuff. Eighteen consecutive  patients (mean age 37.3 years, 16 ulcerative colitis, two familial polyposis) who  underwent proctocolectomy and ileoanal anastomosis on the dentate line were  studied 6 months after closure of the loop ileostomy. The 18 patients and eight  controls underwent: (a) anal manometry; (b) determination of maximum tolerable  volume (MTV); (c) liquid continence test (infusion of NaCl at 60 ml/min for 25  min) with simultaneous measurement of ileal reservoir pressure. The volume  evacuated during 5 min after the continence test was also measured. The frequency  of bowel actions was (mean +/- s.e.m.) 5.3 +/- 0.4 per 24 h (nocturnal 1.14 +/-  0.26). Seventeen of 18 patients (94 per cent) had normal continence and  defaecation; one patient was incontinent. A decrease in resting anal canal  pressure (102.5 +/- 4 versus 47.5 +/- 6 cmH2O) was observed after ileoanal  anastomosis. A rectoanal inhibitory reflex was elicited in one of the 18 patients  (6 per cent). Patients were able to retain 1023 +/- 68 ml saline during the  liquid continence test. The percentage evacuation of the ileal reservoir was 61  +/- 4.5 per cent. Correlations were found (P = 0.05) between daily stool  frequency and the volume of saline retained during the liquid continence test. It  is concluded that conservation of a rectal muscular cuff is not necessary for the  achievement of good clinical results.

AB  - Limb ischemia in experimental animals leads to white blood cell (WBC) and thromboxane (Tx)A2 dependent pulmonary dysfunction. This study examines the  pulmonary sequelae of lower torso ischemia in 20 consecutive patients aged 63 +/-  5 years (mean +/- SEM) who underwent elective abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery.  After 30 minutes of aortic cross-clamping, plasma TxB2 levels had risen from 77  +/- 26 pg/ml to 359 +/- 165 pg/ml (p less than 0.01) and was temporally related  to increases in mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP) from 18 +/- 1 to 23 +/- 3  mmHg (p less than 0.01), as well as to increases in pulmonary vascular resistance  (PVR) from 0.07 +/- 0.02 to 0.12 +/- 0.02 mmHg sec/ml (p less than 0.01). Each  time that the aortic clamp was repositioned and with final declamping, after 83  +/- 10 minutes, there were further increases in MPAP to a peak of 32 +/- 2 mmHg  (p less than 0.01) and in PVR to 0.26 +/- 0.030 mmHg sec/ml (p less than 0.01),  corresponding to a plasma TxB2 level of 406 +/- 177 pg/ml (p less than 0.01).  MPAP and PVR returned to baseline values within 30 minutes of declamping. Ten  minutes after removal of the aortic clamp, platelet levels had fallen from 180  +/- 41 to 97 +/- 17 X 10(3)/mm3 (p less than 0.01) and WBC levels from 8900 +/-  1100 to 4700 +/- 400/mm3 (p less than 0.01). Both platelets and WBC returned  towards normal levels, but at 24 hours, while WBC was elevated at 13000 +/-  900/mm3 (p less than 0.01), platelets were 44% of baseline at 135 +/- 14 X  10(3)/mm3 (p less than 0.01). Four to 8 hours after surgery, pulmonary  dysfunction was manifest by increases in physiologic shunt from 9 +/- 2% to 16  +/- 2% (p less than 0.01), and peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) from 23 +/- 2 to  33 +/- 2 cmH2O (p less than 0.01). Chest radiography demonstrated interstitial  pulmonary edema in all patients, whereas pulmonary artery wedge pressure was 12  +/- 2 mmHg, excluding the possibility of left ventricular failure. After 24  hours, pulmonary edema had resolved, and the PIP and PaO2 had both returned to  baseline. These data indicate that reperfusion of the ischemic lower torso leads  to the synthesis of TxA2, an event temporally related to pulmonary hypertension  and transient leukopenia with subsequent pulmonary microvascular injury manifest  by interstitial edema.

AB  - The effect of cephalic hypotension on brain metabolism was studied in 10 unanesthetized, normoxic (PaO2 greater than 17 mm Hg), late-gestation fetal  lambs. Perfusion pressure (cephalic arterial minus sagittal venous pressure) was  40 +/- 1 mm Hg (SEM) during control and was reduced to 10 +/- 1 by occlusion of  the Grachio-cephalic artery. Cerebral blood flow was measured with microspheres,  and arterial and sagittal vein blood samples were analyzed for oxygen content,  glucose, and lactate. During the occlusion, oxygen consumption decreased from 125  +/- 8 to 95 +/- 4 (p less than 0.05) (all values mumol 100 g-1 min-1), and  glucose uptake increased from 20 +/- 3 to 25 +/- 1 (p less than 0.05). During the  control period, there was no net lactate flux; during the occlusion, lactate  excretion was 5.7 +/- 1.4 (p less than 0.005). The control glucose and oxygen  uptakes demonstrated a normal 6:1 molar ratio; however, during the occlusion, 9.4  mumol 100 g-1 glucose min-1 were taken up in excess of expected aerobic glucose  metabolism. If all of this glucose were anaerobically metabolized to lactate,  three times the measured efflux would be produced. The transport properties of  the fetal blood-brain barrier may be important factors in perinatal brain injury.

AB  - The effects of resuscitation of traumatic-hemorrhagic shock on the brain are unknown. Traumatic shock in sheep (fracture/crush injury, 2-hr hemorrhage to 40  mm Hg) was followed by resuscitation to baseline mean arterial pressure. Two  groups without brain injury were resuscitated with lactated Ringer's (LR1, n = 7)  or albumin (ALB1, n = 6). Focal brain injury was added in two further groups  (LR2, n = 6; ALB2, n = 6). Hemodynamics, intracranial pressure (ICP), EEG, and  colloid osmotic pressure (COP) were followed. Brain water (BW) and cerebral blood  volume (CBV) were compared to those of controls (C, n = 7). RESULTS: ICP rose in  all groups. Animals without brain injury did not have increased brain water.  Below are results for brain-injured animals after resuscitation (mean +/- SEM).  (table; see text) Maintaining COP during initial resuscitation does not minimize  cerebral edema: the effects of LR and ALB were similar in this setting. Focal  brain injury causes edema but does not cause large increases in ICP with initial  resuscitation.

AB  - Seven consecutive patients with grade IV hepatic encephalopathy, due to fulminant hepatic failure complicated by oliguric renal failure were allocated at random to  treatment with daily machine haemofiltration (MHF) or continuous arteriovenous  haemofiltration (CAVHF). Intracranial pressure (ICP) was continuously monitored  using a subdural catheter. Four patients received 17 treatments by MHF, and ICP  increased from 8.4 +/- 1.5 mm Hg (mean + SEM) prior to treatment to 12.6 +/- 1.8  mm Hg on completion (p less than 0.05). Active intervention was required on  twenty occasions to treat sustained increases in ICP (greater than 25 mm Hg  maintained for 5 min or longer). A total of 12 haemofilters were used in the  treatment of 3 patients by CAVHF. The ICP showed greater stability during CAVHF  therapy, the mean pressure prior to treatment was 15.6 +/- 5.2 mm Hg and fell to  11.7 +/- 2.3 mm Hg at 4 h. Sustained increases in ICP occurred in only 1 patient  as a preterminal event. These findings suggest that CAVHF is the preferred method  of treatment in patients with fulminant hepatic failure complicated by oliguric  renal failure who are at risk of developing cerebral oedema.

AB  - Hypertonic (3.0%) saline (HS) resuscitation from hemorrhagic shock is associated with less cerebral edema and lower intracranial pressure (ICP) compared to normal  saline (NS) and 10% Dextran 40 (D-40). The effect of HS resuscitation on cerebral  blood flow (CBF) is unknown. Beagle dogs with a head injury underwent shock and  resuscitation, receiving either NS (N = 6), HS (N = 6), or D-40 (N = 6). CBF (via  a microsphere technique) and ICP were measured at baseline (BL) and at end shock  (ES) after infusion of shed blood and test fluid (ER) and 2 hours after  resuscitation (LR). CBF was determined globally (GCBF), and for the right (RCBF)  and left (LCBF) cerebral hemispheres. ICP values (+/- SEM) at BL and ES were 10.8  +/- 1.31 mmHg and 8.0 +/- 1.67 mmHg, respectively, for all groups. GCBF, RCBF and  LCBF at BL were 29.4 +/- 5.04, 26.7 +/- 4.93 and 26.6 +/- 4.50 ml 100 g-1 min-1,  respectively. ES values for CBF were not significantly different from BL. Global  and hemispheric CBF values were not different between groups at times measured.  ICP was significantly lower in animals receiving HS. Therefore, lower ICP  following HS resuscitation is not associated with alteration in CBF.

AB  - Korean hemorrhagic fever (KHF) is an epidemic viral disease characterized by high fever, hemorrhagic tendency and renal failure, and by hemorrhages of right atrium  and renal medulla as well as necrosis of anterior hypophysis. Plasma  immunoreactive atrial natriuretic peptide (irANP) levels of 15 patients in the  oliguric phase was 94.8 +/- 8.4 pg/ml (mean +/- SEM), 80% higher than of the  normal control group (53.0 +/- 4.7 pg/ml; n = 28). In the diuretic phase it  declined to 63.7 +/- 5.3 pg/ml (n = 26). Plasma renin activity (PRA) in the  oliguric phase was 19.0 +/- 1.3 ng AI/ml/h, and in the diuretic phase 5.3 +/- 0.9  ng AI/ml/h, significantly higher than the control value (2.5 +/- 0.1 ng AI/ml/h).  Elevations of irANP and PRA were not correlated in each group. Also systemic  blood pressure as well as heart beats were significantly increased in the  oliguric phase. These findings suggest that the increased irANP may have resulted  from increased circulatory volume and that the ANP secretory process may not be  affected by the disease.

T2  - Cardiovascular research
AB  - The effect of graded ischaemic injury on post-ischaemic myocardium was examined in rat hearts after three 4 min periods of asphyxia. Systolic function under  steady state conditions and during isovolumic beats, the content of high energy  phosphates and glycogen, and myocardial material properties were determined.  Severity of the oxygen deficiency was varied by manipulating myocardial oxygen  demand (MVO2) either by rapid atrial pacing or by vagal stimulation. After 20 min  of post-asphyxial recovery, steady state haemodynamics were almost normal. In the  high MVO2 group (atrial pacing) the dp/dtmax was reduced to 90%(NS). The  isovolumic indices of function were decreased in all post-asphyxial groups. This  was most pronounced in the high MVO2 group, with a reduction in peak left  ventricular systolic pressure to 85.7 (SEM 3.4)% and a decrease in peak left  ventricular systolic stress to 82.3(3.9)% (p less than 0.01). The post-asphyxial  myocardial performance recovered better in the low MVO2 group (vagal  stimulation). Material properties were altered only in the high MVO2 group. The  decreased content of ATP and glycogen were comparable in all post-asphyxial  groups. A phosphocreatine overshoot phenomenon was most marked in the high MVO2  group: 11.4(2.8) mumol.g-1 v 4.7(0.9) mumol.g-1 (control), p less than 0.01. The  results indicate that post-ischaemic contractile dysfunction of reversibly  injured is not closely related to the previous O2 deficit or to the functional  impairment. We also obtained no correlation between ATP content and material  properties in modestly injured post-ischaemic myocardium.

AB  - Cardiac transplantation is frequently associated with accelerated coronary atherosclerosis and immune-mediated microvascular injury. To determine if  orthotopic cardiac transplantation impairs the capacity of the coronary  vasculature to vasodilate and conduct hyperemic blood flow, maximal coronary  vasodilator reserve was measured in 25 cardiac allograft recipients with no  evidence of rejection 6-57 months after transplantation and in 20 normal  subjects. Left ventricular wall thickness was assessed echocardiographically, and  epicardial coronary anatomy was evaluated by quantitative coronary angiography.  Coronary vasodilator reserve (CVDR) was measured in all patients with a coronary  Doppler catheter and a maximally vasodilating dose of intracoronary papaverine.  CVDR measured in the transplant recipients with normal coronary arteries, left  ventricular function, and wall thickness (5.0 +/- 0.3 [mean +/- SEM] peak/resting  velocity; range, 3.8-7.3; n = 16) was not different from that of normal subjects  (4.8 +/- 0.2; range, 3.7-8.3). CVDR in the five cardiac allograft recipients with  diffuse coronary atherosclerosis producing 30 +/- 5% narrowing (range, 25-38%) of  epicardial vessel diameter also was normal (5.1 +/- 0.3; range, 4.3-6.2; n = 5).  The CVDR was reduced, however, in two of the four cardiac allograft recipients  with left ventricular hypertrophy. In the only transplant recipient in whom a  regional wall motion abnormality was present, CVDR was abnormal in the vascular  distribution of the hypokinetic wall segment (1.8) but was normal in the artery  that supplied normally functioning myocardium (4.0). These findings demonstrate  that in the absence of allograft rejection, acquired left ventricular  hypertrophy, and regional wall motion abnormalities, coronary vasodilator reserve  is normal after orthotopic human cardiac transplantation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT  250 WORDS)

AB  - Hypermetabolism, increased heart rate, and lipolysis are responses to high catecholamine levels associated with burn injury. This study tests the hypothesis  that adrenergic beta blockade in burns could reduce myocardial work, lipolysis,  and negative nitrogen balance without adversely affecting cardiac or metabolic  function. Eighteen patients with burns of 70 +/- 3% total burn surface area  (TBSA) (Mean +/- SEM), were studied after a 5-day infusion of 2 mg/Kg of  intravenous (I.V.) propranolol infusion every 24 hours without their cardiac  output or resting energy expenditure being adversely reduced. Heart rate, left  ventricular work, and rate pressure product were significantly reduced by 20, 22,  and 36%, respectively (P less than 0.05). Plasma glucose, free fatty acids,  triglycerides, and insulin levels remained unchanged. The rate of urea  production, however, was significantly increased by 54 +/- 12% in fasted  patients, and to a much lesser 12 +/- 2% in fed patients. The marked decrease in  myocardial work afforded by propranolol administration may be of clinical benefit  in the treatment of large burns. Variations in drug dosage and feeding regimens  will, however, need to be perfected to limit catabolic effects.

AB  - The brown pigmentation of the skin associated with venous ulceration is caused by increased local iron deposition. Diagnostic x-ray spectrometry, a method based on  x-ray fluorescence analysis, was used for the noninvasive determination of iron  levels in the skin of patients with venous ulceration. The mean (+/- SEM) iron  concentration in the skin around the venous ulcer was elevated, compared with  control values of nonulcerated skin (250 +/- 54 vs 128 +/- 39 micrograms) and  compared with normal skin from the forearm (250 +/- 54 vs 14 +/- 2.5 micrograms).  These data suggest that dermal iron deposition may not be an incidental  by-product of increased venous pressure, but may actively perpetuate tissue  damage in venous ulcerations.

AB  - Lung injury following intravenous oleic acid is characterized by pulmonary edema, leukopenia and hypoxemia. Because leukotrienes can increase permeability and  cause leukocyte adherence, we evaluated their potential role in oleic  acid-induced lung injury in the anesthetized rat using a selective LTD4/E4  antagonist, LY171883. 99mTc-albumin and 99mTc-red blood cells (99mTc-RBC) were  used to measure changes in the pulmonary permeability index and intravascular  space by non-invasive scintigraphy. Intravenous oleic acid (0.06 ml/kg) increased  the pulmonary permeability index 11 (P less than 0.01) and 5.8 fold (P less than  0.01) at 5 and 50 min after its injection compared to baseline, but had no effect  on mean pulmonary arterial pressure or pulmonary distribution of 99mTc-RBC. Oleic  acid also induced arterial hypoxemia, and increased bronchoalveolar lavage-fluid  levels of immunoreactive (i) leukotriene LTC4 from 0.40 +/- 0.14 ng/ml to 2.27  +/- 0.55 ng/ml (mean +/- S.E.M., n = 4, P less than 0.05) and iLTB4 (from 0.42  +/- 0.05 ng/ml to 1.91 +/- 0.63 ng/ml, n = 5-7, P less than 0.01). LY171883  attenuated the elevated permeability by 24% and 68% at 5 (P less than 0.05) and  50 min (P less than 0.01), but did not alter the hypoxemia. These results support  the hypothesis that oleic acid elevates leukotriene levels which may increase  pulmonary vascular permeability. Furthermore, they suggest that the prevention of  elevated pulmonary vascular permeability and edema may be necessary, but are  clearly not sufficient to prevent arterial hypoxemia following oleic acid injury  in the rat.

AB  - Platelet-activating factor has been implicated in a variety of disease processes including ischemic brain injury and endotoxic shock, but its effects on cerebral  blood flow (CBF) and metabolism in normal brain have not been described. The  effects of platelet-activating factor on global CBF (hydrogen clearance) and the  global cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (CMRO2) were studied in halothane-N2O  anesthetized Wistar rats. Hexadecyl-platelet-activating factor infused into the  right carotid artery (67 pmol/min) for 60 min decreased mean arterial pressure  (MAP) from 122 +/- 4 (x +/- SEM) to 77 +/- 6 mm Hg and CBF from 159 +/- 12 to 116  +/- 14 ml/100 g/min (p less than 0.002). In contrast, CMRO2 increased from 9.7  +/- 0.9 to 11.7 +/- 1.1 ml/100 g/min after 15 min (p less than 0.05). In controls  rendered similarly hypotensive by blood withdrawal and infused with the  platelet-activating factor vehicle, CMRO2 was unchanged, whereas CBF transiently  decreased then returned to baseline at 60 min. These cerebrovascular and  cerebrometabolic effects of PAF are reminiscent of and may be relevant to  hypoperfusion and hypermetabolism observed after global brain ischemia and in  endotoxic shock.

The resulting endothelial injury was studied by light microscopy  (LM), scanning (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Tweezer-grasping  resulted in focal destruction of the endothelial lining, whereas digital handling  (rolling the vein 3-4 times between the gloved fingers) resulted in minor  morphological endothelial cell alterations.

AB  - Amiodarone (ADR), a new antiarrhythmic drug for life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias, causes pneumonitis or lung fibrosis in a sizeable minority of  patients. The cause of lung damage is not known. We have shown that infusion of  10 mg amiodarone into the inflow circuit of ventilated and perfused rabbit lungs  causes immediate increase in pulmonary artery pressure (mean +/- SEM) (from 13.6  +/- 1.2 to 40.6 +/- 9.5 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) and pulmonary edema with marked  increase in the pulmonary generation of thromboxane and leukotrienes C4 and/or  D4. Albumin (2 g%) in the perfusate prevents any increase in lung perfusion  pressure or edema formation. When lung perfusion pressure increase is blocked  with the combined cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase inhibitor enolicam sodium  (CG5391B, 35 microM in perfusate), significant lung edema still occurs after  amiodarone, indicating that amiodarone causes increased alveolar-capillary  membrane permeability. Addition of catalase (100 U/ml) or superoxide dismutase  and catalase (100 U/ml each) to perfusate fails to protect from amiodarone lung  injury. Immediate infusion of amiodarone (10 mg) into lungs ventilated with room  air (ADR + RA) causes an increase in lung weight gain from baseline (delta W) of  5.7 +/- 1.5 g/min. Compared with ADR + RA, ventilation of lungs with 4% O2 (delta  W = 0.7 +/- 0.3 g/min, p less than 0.05), pretreatment of rabbits for 3 days with  butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA, 100 mg/kg/day i.p., delta W = 0.05 +/- 0.02 g/min,  p less than 0.01), pretreatment of rabbits for 3 days with vitamin E (Vit E, 300  U/day orally, delta W = 0.6 +/- 0.2 g/min, p less than 0.05), or addition of  N-acetylcysteine to the lung perfusate (NAC, 5 mM, delta W = 0.1 +/- 0.08 g/min,  p less than 0.01) all protect from lung edema formation after amiodarone.  Amiodarone (100 mg) also caused a marked increase in luminol-enhanced lung  chemiluminescence, lung production of superoxide anion (O2-), and tissue levels  of lung glutathione disulfide. These results suggest that amiodarone causes lung  injury by an oxidant mechanism.

AB  - We evaluated the efficacy of intracoronary administration of verapamil hydrochloride in reducing myocardial injury during acute ischemia and  reperfusion. Ischemia was induced by 30% and 45% reductions of circumflex  arterial blood flow for successive 2-hour periods. A reperfusion period (1 hour  and 45 minutes) followed ischemia upon deflation of a pneumatic occluder.  Verapamil (30 micrograms/kg) was slowly injected into the circumflex artery as a  bolus 15 minutes after each blood flow reduction step. To prevent  verapamil-induced decreases in heart rate, ventricular pacing was established at  170 beats/min before a baseline period and maintained throughout the protocol.  Creatine kinase activities (international units per milligram protein) measured  in samples obtained from posterior papillary muscles were 15 +/- 1 (mean +/- SEM)  and 10 +/- 2 for animals receiving verapamil or its saline vehicle, respectively  (p less than 0.05). Quantitative morphometry was performed on left ventricular  myocardium after staining with p-nitro blue tetrazolium. Intracoronary  administration of verapamil reduced the extent of left ventricular infarction, as  disclosed by positive tetrazolium staining of the tissue, from 34 +/- 4% of the  left ventricle in vehicle-treated animals to 21 +/- 4% of the left ventricle in  verapamil-treated animals (p less than 0.05). We conclude that intracoronary  administration of verapamil reduced the extent of myocardial infarction acutely,  independent of increases in blood flow through the circumflex coronary artery or  decreases in heart rate. Administration of verapamil was not associated with  decreases in ventricular afterload, the pressure-rate index, cardiac output, or  the maximum rate of pressure development in the left ventricle. Verapamil  treatment of animals subjected to ischemia was not associated with sustained  elevations of left atrial pressure to values above those measured in animals  receiving the vehicle.

AB  - Severely injured trauma victims are frequently hypothermic. It is unclear, however, whether hypothermia itself is a detrimental or protective physiologic  response to injury. One of the major consequences of fluid resuscitation  following ischemic injury is edema formation, characterized by  ischemia-reperfusion injury models. The purpose of this study was to examine the  effect of regional hypothermia on a feline intestinal model of  ischemia-reperfusion injury. An autoperfused segment of cat ileum was isolated  and arterial, venous, and lymphatic vessels were cannulated. Lymph flow (Q1),  lymph (C1), and plasma (Cp) protein concentrations and segmental blood flow (Qb)  were measured. Permeability changes were characterized by the minimal C1/Cp ratio  obtained by elevating venous outflow pressure. Animals were divided into the  following groups: Group I: 1 hr of intestinal ischemia (30 mm Hg) with  autoreperfusion; Group II: 1 hr of intestinal hypothermia (28 degrees C) with  subsequent rewarming; Group III: 1 hr of combined ischemia and hypothermia. Group  III animals were either kept hypothermic (IIIA) or rewarmed (IIIB) during  autoreperfusion. Minimal C1/Cp ratios (mean +/- SEM) were as follows: CONTROL:  0.15 +/- 0.02; Group I*: 0.32 +/- 0.03; Group II: 0.15 +/- 0.01; Group IIIA: 0.18  +/- 0.02; Group IIIB*: 0.42 +/- 0.02; (* = P less than 0.01 vs control).  Reperfusion flow rates were no different between Group IIIA and Group IIIB  animals. Ischemia-reperfusion, but not hypothermia alone, caused a marked  increase in intestinal capillary permeability. Permeability increased after  combined ischemia and hypothermia only if reperfusion was accompanied by  rewarming. Hypothermic reperfusion protected against the increased permeability  following ischemia.

AB  - The effects of a bolus injection of propofol on mean intracranial pressure were studied in six adult, comatose patients who had severe head injuries. Propofol 2  mg/kg was given intravenously over 90 seconds when the mean intracranial pressure  reached or exceeded 25 mmHg. Arterial blood gas values, heart rate and central  venous pressure remained stable at all measurements. Arterial blood pressure  decreased statistically significantly (p less than 0.05) within one minute after  propofol administration. The mean (SEM) intracranial pressure decreased  statistically significantly (p less than 0.05) at 30 seconds and at 1 and 2  minutes, from 25 (3) to 11 (4) mmHg. The cerebral perfusion pressure decreased  statistically significantly from 92 (8) mmHg at all measurements (p less than  0.05). The lowest value at 3 minutes was 50 (7) mmHg but in four patients at that  time the perfusion pressure was below 50 mmHg.

AB  - In patients with severe head injury, midazolam is a convenient agent for sedation during mechanical ventilation, although its sedative effect can be prolonged. We  investigated the effects of acute midazolam reversal by RO 15-1788 (RO), a  benzodiazepine antagonist, on intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral perfusion  pressure (CPP) and on recovery in 18 studies performed on 15 patients with severe  head injury (Glasgow coma score less than 8). ICP increased significantly from  16.3 mmHg +/- 2 (mean +/- SEM) to 24.1 mmHg +/- 4.2 (p less than 0.02) and to  25.2 mmHg +/- 4 (p less than 0.01), 5 and 10 min respectively after RO  administration. Analysis of the results showed 2 patterns of response in ICP. In  patients with good control of ICP before RO administration, there was no change  in ICP and CPP, whereas in patients with abnormal ICP, RO injection induced  severe increase in ICP and concomitant decrease in CPP. Arousal after midazolam  reversal was obvious in 5 patients who were quickly extubated. Midazolam reversal  by RO should not be attempted in patients with severe head injury and unstable  ICP.

AB  - To clarify the controversy over whether the neonatal heart is more or less susceptible to global ischemia than the adult heart, the time interval between  the onset of ischemia and the beginning of contracture (TIC) was compared in  neonatal (n = 6, 3 to 5 days old) and adult (n = 6, 4 to 5 months old) pig  hearts. A comparison of the myocardial concentrations (mumol/g wet weight) of  ATP, glycogen, lactate, and glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) was also done. The  anesthetized animals underwent a sternotomy, and control right ventricular  myocardial biopsy samples were taken. The heart of each was rapidly excised and  placed in a 37 degrees C substrate-free Krebs-Henseleit bath. A compliant balloon  was placed in the left ventricle to record pressure changes. Time to onset and  peak TIC were recorded and additional proximal right ventricular biopsy samples  were taken. Data were recorded as mean +/- SEM. Results demonstrated that  neonatal hearts had a significantly shorter (p less than .05) TIC (29.5 +/- 1.7  min) than adult hearts (43.0 +/- 2.9 min) and exhibited more rapid lactate  accumulation (2.5 +/- 0.5 to 22.1 +/- 3.0, p less than .001) and an increase in  G-6-P (0.07 +/- 0.03 to 0.34 +/- 0.07, p less than .01) with a nonsignificant  decline in myocardial glycogen (23.3 +/- 12.1 to 17.4 +/- 4.0, p greater than  .05). Our findings indicate that neonatal hearts are more sensitive than adult  hearts to global ischemia, which has potential implications for myocardial  protection in pediatric cardiac surgery.

AB  - This report analyzes experience with a modified four-limb W-shaped ileal pouch that has a larger initial capacity than do J- or S-shaped pouch designs. Fifteen  patients (median age: 35 years) underwent W pouch reconstruction after  proctocolectomy for ulcerative colitis and familial adenomatous polyposis.  Follow-up on each patient averaged 14 months (range: 6 to 24 months). All  procedures were performed without death and with minimal morbidity. Assessment of  functional results showed 24-hour stool frequency (mean +/- SEM) decreasing from  6.0 +/- 0.39 initially to 4.8 +/- 0.43 at 1 year (p less than 0.005). Night  evacuation decreased from 1.1 +/- 0.2 at 1 month after surgery to 0.25 +/- 0.12  at 1 year (p less than 0.025), with 10 of 15 patients having no nocturnal pouch  evacuation. Continence was excellent in all patients with the exception of three  of 15 patients who had occasional minimal nighttime seepage. Pouch volume  determined at surgery by saline solution infusion was 200 +/- 21 ml. Pouch volume  and compliance (pressure/volume) were measured before ileostomy closure and at 6  months after surgery via a special pressure-monitored balloon catheter. Maximal  pouch volume increased from 190 +/- 21 ml (at time of ileostomy takedown) to 470  +/- 85 ml at 6 months. Ileal reservoir construction with a W pouch design  resulted in a low 24-hour and nighttime stool frequency and excellent compliance  and evacuation characteristics.

TI  - Structural and functional properties of initial lymphatics in the rat tongue: scanning electron microscopic findings.
AU  - Castenholz, A.
T2  - Lymphology
AB  - The luminal and outer wall morphology of the initial lymphatics in the rat tongue were demonstrated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) after tissue perfusion  with pressures up to 300 torr, topical heat and histamine administration. The  findings emphasize the structural and functional importance of the reticular  fiber network of the basement lamina (in contradistinction to single "anchoring  filaments") as a supportive framework for lymphatic endothelium and a major  regulatory role in tissue volume control. Increased tissue pressure was  associated with dilatation of initial lymphatics which was maximal at  approximately 60 torr. Higher pressures (up to 300 torr) did not damage the  vessels. This vasodilatory response of the initial lymphatics was even more  evident when tissue swelling was hindered by externally applied plaster  "bandage". Under SEM, protruding and branched cells were conspicuous in otherwise  flat lymphatic endothelium. These cells may have contractile properties and with  pronounced dilatation, thermal injury and application of histamine these cells  probably contract, thereby creating large gaps at the site of open junctions.

AB  - As manifest by tubular collapse and the virtual absence of flow into the glomerulotubular junction (GTJ), filtration in most nephrons (SNGFR) of rats  poisoned with 9 mg/kg body wt HgCl2 16 to 28 hours earlier was virtually absent.  Arterial colloid osmotic pressure (COPA) and Bowman's space pressure (PBS) were  modestly depressed (P less than 0.05 or below), and mean blood pressure was  reduced from 115 +/- 2 mm Hg (SEM) to 97 +/- 1 mm Hg (P less than 0.001).  Glomerular capillary hydraulic pressure (Pg), 25.6 +/- 1.3 mm Hg was some 24 mm  Hg lower than control (P less than 0.001) and yielded a net afferent effective  filtration pressure (Pnet) of 4.1 +/- 1.2 mm Hg. Excluding three rats with values  greater than 10 mm Hg, Pnet averaged 2.0 +/- 0.9 mm Hg (N = 17 rats) versus 20.0  +/- 1.8 mm Hg in controls (N = 10, P less than 0.001), the former being  statistically almost indistinguishable from 0 mm Hg and barely able to support  any filtration. This decrease in Pg was caused by a major increase in  preglomerular resistance (RA) and a reciprocal fall in efferent arteriolar  resistance (RE), the RA/RE ratio of 7.2 +/- 0.8 being fourfold higher than  control (P less than 0.001). Renocortical blood flow was not different from  control (P greater than 0.2). A wide spread of Pg values in individual glomeruli  and the absence of tubular flow despite the appearance of i.v. injected lissamine  green in a quadrant of surface glomeruli suggested the possibility of a greatly  increased, glomerular capillary resistance. It is concluded that reciprocal  changes in RA and RE are the immediate cause of filtration failure in this form  of ARF and that, in the virtual absence of filtration, tubular leakage can play  no important role. Since PBS was depressed in both the developmental and  established phases of ARF, tubular obstruction appears to play no direct role in  the pathogenesis of this particular model of murine acute renal failure.

AB  - The long chain fatty acid composition of phospholipids in colonic mucosa was determined by high performance liquid chromatography in nine patients with active  ulcerative colitis and eight healthy controls. The arachidonic acid composition  was 12.5 +/- 1.4 mol % (mean +/- 2 SEM) in the inflamed colonic mucosa from the  patients with active ulcerative colitis and 6.8 +/- 1.2 mol % in the intact  mucosa from healthy controls (p less than 0.001). In the inflamed colonic mucosa,  oleic acid and palmitoleic acid were concomitantly decreased (p less than 0.001  and p less than 0.02, respectively), while docosahexaenoic acid was increased (p  less than 0.05). Histopathological examination showed that there was a three fold  increase in the cell density of inflammatory infiltrate in the lamina propria of  the inflamed colonic mucosa (p less than 0.001). The cell density of inflammatory  infiltrate correlated with the arachidonic acid composition of phospholipids in  colonic mucosa (r = 0.89, p less than 0.005). These findings indicate that  inflammation alters the long chain fatty acid composition of phospholipids in  colonic mucosa. The observed increase in the arachidonic acid composition of  phospholipids in inflamed colonic mucosa may contribute to the enhanced  arachidonic acid metabolism in patients with active ulcerative colitis.

AU  - Feustel, P. J.

T2  - The Journal of surgical research
AB  - The mechanism of increased susceptibility of the traumatized brain to hypoxemia (HYP) was investigated by measuring the local cortical blood flow (LCBF) by  hydrogen clearance. Following pentobarbital anesthesia and head injury (HI) using  a repetitive acceleration/deceleration injury, five surviving cats were  ventilated to maintain arterial PCO2 (28.3 +/- 1.8 Torr, mean +/- SEM). Three  control (C) animals received no head injury. LCBF (ml/min/100 g) measurements at  two cortical locations were made between 30 and 60 min postinjury, at 10 min and  40 min of HYP (PaO2 = 29.5 +/- 2.6 Torr), and at 30-min intervals for 4.5 hr  after HYP. Before HYP, LCBF was not different in cortical areas in C (84 +/- 12  ml/min/100 g) and HI (81 +/- 17 ml/min/100 g) animals. In C animals LCBF  increased to 141 +/- 10 after 10 min of HYP and remained elevated at 40 min (P  less than 0.05). Ten minutes post-HYP, LCBF fell to 56 +/- 8 ml/min/100 g.  Hypoxemia did not increase LCBF significantly in HI animals (87 +/- 17 ml/min/100  g). Post-HYP, LCBF in HI animals remained unchanged. In 78% of HI LCBF  measurements, clearances following a brief H2 inhalation were faster than  clearances following tissue equilibration with H2. This may be due to  nonhomogeneous tissue perfusion in HI animals. In conclusion, after head injury  there may be an attenuated microvascular blood flow response to hypoxemia and  flow inhomogeneities which will accentuate tissue hypoxia.

T2  - Critical care medicine
AB  - To test the hypothesis that angiotensin II could be a mediator of acute lung injury, we studied the effects of perindopril diacid, a new  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, on hemodynamics, blood gases, lung  mechanics, and extravascular lung water (EVLW). Twenty-four dogs were  anesthetized, paralyzed and ventilated with a fraction of inspired oxygen of 0.4  in which pulmonary edema was induced by 0.1 ml/kg iv oleic acid. Perindopril  diacid (1 mg/kg) was administered iv either before (eight dogs) or 100 min after  (eight dogs) oleic acid injection. In the control group (eight dogs) not treated  with perindopril diacid, 150 min after oleic acid injection, PaO2 changed from  193 +/- 7 (mean +/- SEM) to 55 +/- 4 torr, venous admixture from 3 +/- 1% to 52  +/- 5%, cardiac index from 4.1 +/- 0.3 to 3.1 +/- 0.3 L/min X m2, mean pulmonary  artery pressure from 13 +/- 1 to 17 +/- 1 mm Hg, dynamic compliance from 90 +/- 8  to 46 +/- 7 ml/cm H2O, and EVLW from 165 +/- 25 to 750 +/- 92 ml/m2.  Administration of perindopril diacid reduced systemic BP by 20% but did not  affect other hemodynamic variables, blood gases, or dynamic compliance. Maximum  increases in EVLW were from 169 +/- 16 to 615 +/- 54 ml/m2 in the pretreated  group and from 188 +/- 23 to 675 +/- 56 ml/m2 in the treated group (no  significant difference from the control group). However, pretreatment with  perindopril diacid significantly (p less than .05) slowed the rise in EVLW, which  was lower 60 and 90 min after oleic acid injection compared to untreated dogs.  Plasma renin activity and angiotensin I concentration increased after oleic acid  injection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - Laser Doppler (LD) measures blood flow in approximately one cubic millimeter of tissue. The LD instrument is well suited to the determination of the initiation  of flow in the microcirculation after a period of arrest due to externally  applied counterpressure. Radioisotope clearance and photoplethysmography have  been used to measure skin perfusion pressure (SPP) in an effort to predict  healing of ischemic ulcerations and amputation wounds. By placing the LD probe  beneath a blood pressure cuff, SPP was measured at the forearm, thigh, calf,  foot, dorsal and plantar great toe. The SPP was measured in 32 normal limbs and  26 limbs with rest pain, ulceration or gangrene. Skin of normal extremities and  forearm and thigh skin of patients with ischemic lower extremities had a mean SPP  of 47 mmHg (+/- 5 SEM). The SPP in ischemic extremities was significantly lower  at the calf 22 +/- 4 (p less than .001), the foot 10 +/- 2 (p less than .0001),  and the toe 16 +/- 4 (p less than .0001). SPP was greater at the plantar toe (73  +/- 5) than in all other locations. Skin of the plantar toe was unique among the  sites measured because it is rich in arteriovenous anastomoses, which have a  thermoregulatory function. The higher pressure probably reflects the fact that  the larger arterioles have a higher intraluminal pressure than the capillaries  and, therefore, a more proximal level of the microcirculation is measured by the  LD instrument in thermoregulatory areas of the skin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250  WORDS)

AB  - We compared amounts of lipoxygenase products with the extent of leukocyte infiltration in the ischemic myocardium with an occlusion-reperfusion model of  open-chest dog. Changes in peripheral leukocyte count and leukocyte function  estimated by neutrophil aggregation induced by calcium ionophore A23187 were also  examined. The ischemic tissue (120 +/- 40 ng/g, mean +/- SEM) showed a marked  increase in 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE) production compared with the  normal tissue (13 +/- 1 ng/g, p less than 0.01). The production of 5-HETE in the  ischemic tissue was also augmented as well. When we examined the correlation  between production of either 12-HETE or 5-HETE and leukocyte infiltration in the  ischemic tissue, the former was augmented markedly in proportion to the extent of  the latter. Leukocyte count in peripheral circulation was gradually increased  after reperfusion. Similarly, neutrophil aggregation was significantly augmented  during reperfusion. These results indicate that production of lipoxygenase  metabolites associated with leukocyte infiltration in the reperfused ischemic  tissue was increased during the course of myocardial infarction, which was  accompanied by activation of leukocyte in peripheral circulation. Further studies  should be done to clarify the importance of lipoxygenase metabolites in the  evolution of reperfusion-induced myocardial injury.

AB  - The 'optimal' hematocrit to which patients should be resuscitated after shock and trauma is controversial. To test the hypothesis that sufficient oxygen delivery  can be provided at a lower hematocrit without impairing oxygen consumption or  hemodynamic function, 25 patients were prospectively studied immediately  following injury and/or acute hemorrhage. Patients were randomized to have their  hematocrits (HCT) maintained near 30% (29.7 +/- 0.4% (M +/- SEM); n = 12) or 40%  (38.4 +/- 0.6%, n = 13). Cardiopulmonary parameters were measured twice a day for  3 days. Statistical analysis used a repeated measures analysis of variance with  patient age, and ventilator parameters (FIO2, PEEP, and ventilator mode) as  covariates. Arterial and venous O2 saturations were not significantly different  at different hematocrits, although arterial and venous O2 contents were lower at  30% HCT (a = 14.1 +/- 0.2 m10(2)/dl, v = 10.1 +/- 0.3 m10(2)/dl; vs. a = 17.4 +/-  0.4 m10(2)/dl, v = 13.6 +/- 0.6 m10(2)/dl; p less than 0.05). This resulted in a  lower oxygen delivery at the lower HCT. Between the two groups, there also was no  significant difference in cardiac index (overall mean, 3.64 +/- 0.16 ml/min/m2),  heart rate (99 +/- 4 bpm), systemic vascular resistance (1,058 +/- 55  dyne-sec/cm5), or left ventricular stroke work index (4.3 +/- 0.3 X 10(6)  dyne-cm/m2). Intrapulmonary shunt was higher with higher hematocrit (22.6 +/-  2.4% at 40% HCT vs. 14.6 +/- 1.6% at 30% HCT; p less than 0.05) with no  difference in end-expiratory pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Studies on gastric bicarbonate secretion in man.
AU  - Forssell, H.
T2  - Acta chirurgica Scandinavica. Supplementum
AB  - A method for measurement of human basal and stimulated gastric bicarbonate secretion was developed in the present investigation. The mechanisms involved in  the regulation of basal, vagus nerve stimulated as well as fundic distension  induced bicarbonate secretion were studied. The investigations were performed in  healthy subjects and duodenal ulcer patients, the latter group before and/or  after a proximal gastric vagotomy operation. Healthy subjects as well as ulcer  patients were premedicated with a histamine H2-receptor antagonist and gastric  bicarbonate secretion was determined by use of a gastric perfusion system in  combination with computerized continuous recordings of pH and PCO2. The  contribution of alkaline saliva to the measured gastric bicarbonate secretion was  minimized by continuous salivary suction and correction was made for swallowed  saliva by measurement of amylase in the gastric aspirate. A high rate of gastric  perfusion facilitated the identification of alkaline duodenogastric reflux and  also eliminated its influence on the measurement of gastric bicarbonate  secretion. Validation of the measuring system by instillation of small amounts of  bicarbonate showed a satisfactory correlation between added and recovered  bicarbonate in the range of bicarbonate determinations usually recorded.  Decreasing intragastric pH to between 3 and 4 converted all secreted bicarbonate  into CO2, but did not affect the measured value of bicarbonate secretion. Vagal  stimulation accomplished by sham feeding increased gastric bicarbonate secretion  in sixteen healthy subjects from 410 +/- 39 mumol/h to 692 +/- 67 mumol/h (mean  +/- SEM, p less than 0.001). This response was independent of intragastric pH in  the range of 2 to 7. The muscarinic receptor antagonist, benzilonium bromide,  almost abolished the sham feeding response while indomethacin left it nearly  unchanged. Nine duodenal ulcer patients had identical basal and vagally  stimulated bicarbonate output as healthy subjects. Two months after proximal  gastric vagotomy, the basal bicarbonate secretion was significantly increased,  whereas the output in response to sham feeding was unaltered. In the early  postoperative period, anticholinergics reduced the enhanced basal bicarbonate  secretion to a preoperative level. In six healthy subjects, graded fundic  distension with a balloon to volumes of 150 ml, 300 ml and 600 ml, each  distension period lasting 60 minutes, increased the bicarbonate secretion by 46%  (p less than 0.05), 28% (NS) and 84% (p less than 0.05), respectively.(ABSTRACT  TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

AB  - The clinical significance of anterior precordial ST segment depression during acute inferior myocardial infarction was evaluated in 67 consecutive patients  early after onset of symptoms with gated blood pool scans, thallium-201 perfusion  images, and 12-lead ECGs. Patients with anterior ST depression (n = 33) had  depressed mean values for left ventricular ejection fraction (54 +/- 2% [mean +/-  S.E.M.] vs 59 +/- 2%; p = 0.02), cardiac index (3.1 +/- 0.2 vs 3.6 +/- 0.2 L/m2;  p = 0.03), and ratio of systolic blood pressure to end-systolic volume (2.0 +/-  0.1 vs 2.5 +/- 0.3 mm Hg/ml; p = 0.04) compared to patients with no anterior ST  depression (n = 34). Patients with anterior ST depression had (1) lower mean wall  motion values for the inferior, apical, and inferior posterolateral segments (p  less than 0.05) and (2) greater reductions in thallium-201 uptake in the inferior  and posterolateral regions (p less than 0.05). However, anterior and septal (1)  wall motion and (2) thallium-201 uptake were similar in patients with and without  ST depression. Thus, anterior precordial ST segment depression in patients with  acute inferior wall myocardial infarction represents more than a reciprocal  electrical phenomenon. It identifies patients with more severe wall motion  impairment and greater hypoperfusion of the inferior and adjacent segments. The  poorer global left ventricular function in these patients is a result of more  extensive inferior infarction and not of remote septal or anterior injury.

AB  - The ability to predict successful healing of ulcerations and amputations of the ischemic forefoot continues to be a major clinical challenge, particularly in  diabetic patients whose systolic Doppler ankle pressures are often artifactually  elevated. We have used the techniques of laser Doppler velocimetry (LD) and  transcutaneous oxygen tension monitoring (tcPO2) to quantitatively measure skin  blood flow in the distal foot. Fifty-nine limbs were studied (48 patients), of  which 37 (63%) were in diabetic and 22 (37%) in nondiabetic patients. All  patients were admitted with ischemic ulcerations or gangrenous changes of the  forefoot or digit. Twenty transmetatarsal or digital amputations were performed;  the remainder of the lesions were débrided and allowed to heal by secondary  intention or were covered by a skin graft. Before operation, the systolic  pressure (expressed in millimeters of mercury, mean +/- SEM) was measured by  Doppler technique at the ankle, and the ankle/arm index calculated (n = 59  limbs). The tcPO2 (also expressed in millimeters of mercury, mean +/- SEM) was  measured from the dorsal foot (n = 56). The baseline skin blood flow velocity  (SBFV) and pulse wave amplitude (PWA) were measured with the LD (expressed in  millivolts, mean +/- SEM) on the plantar aspect of the foot (n = 53 limbs).  Criteria for successful healing included a tcPO2 of more than 10 mm Hg, the  combination of an LD-SBFV of more than 40 mV and an LD-PWA of more than 4 mV, and  an ankle systolic pressure of more than 30 mm Hg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250  WORDS)

AB  - Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is a standard treatment for patients with refractory hypoxemia due to an acute restrictive pathology. The therapeutic range  of PEEP can be quite narrow. PEEP therapy has been optimized using invasive  variables such as oxygen transport and pulmonary shunt, and noninvasive variables  such as compliance; however, the measurements are complex. We constructed a  computerized PEEP-optimization system consisting of a Siemens 900C ventilator,  Siemens prototype sulfur hexafluoride analyzer, Siemens 940 lung mechanics  analyzer, and a DEC 11/23 microcomputer. The user may choose from three different  noninvasive PEEP titration algorithms: maximizing static total respiratory system  compliance (CTR), maximizing functional residual capacity(FRC)-based compliance  (CFRC), and normalizing FRC. The device was tested in six dogs with pulmonary  injury induced by oleic acid. The system was constrained to 3-cm H2O PEEP steps  at 20-min intervals. The algorithm normalizing FRC reached optimal PEEP levels in  40 min, with a mean difference from the desired FRC of 15 +/- 48 (SEM) ml. This  corresponds to a mean percent error of 1.0% +/- 2.63%. The CFRC and CTR  algorithms reached optimal PEEP levels in 60 and 40 min, respectively, and  maintained a maximal compliance for 85% of the time. This system provides fully  automated noninvasive PEEP titration and is flexible enough to incorporate easily  any other PEEP titration algorithms. It should improve patient care by  guaranteeing that PEEP therapy is truly optimized throughout the patient's  recovery.

AB  - A semiquantitative glomerular damage index (GDI) was determined for overall (O), superficial (S), and juxtamedullary (JM) glomeruli in four models of experimental  hypertension in the rat to assess the severity and distribution of injury in  light of present day knowledge of glomerular hemodynamics. After a four week  period of similar hypertension, comparison of Group 1 (renal ablation) with Group  2 (aortic ligature) revealed OGDIs of 0.420 +/- 0.064 (SEM) vs. 0.062 +/- 0.019,  P less than 0.0001, SGDIs of 0.250 +/- 0.071 vs. 0.035 +/- 0.007, P less than  0.0089, and JGDIs of 0.455 +/- 0.071 vs. 0.155 +/- 0.036, P less than 0.002.  Within Group 1 the SGDI and JMGDI were not significantly different but within  Group 2 the SGDI was less (P less than 0.005) than the JMGDI. Arterial/arteriolar  damage was comparable in both groups. After an eight week period of similar  hypertension, comparison of Group 3 (deoxycorticosterone-saline) with Group 4  (stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats) showed OGDIs of 0.301 +/- 0.065  vs. 0.128 +/- 0.023, P less than 0.025, SGDIs of 0.289 +/- 0.096 vs. 0.072 +/-  0.015, P less than 0.044, and JMGDIs of 0.394 +/- 0.083 vs. 0.307 +/- 0.062, NS.  Within Group 3 the SGDI and JMGDI were not significantly different, but within  Group 4 the SGDI was less (P less than 0.002) than the JMGDI. Vascular damage in  the two groups was comparable. Taking into account known physiologic data, the  findings are consistent with the idea that increased preglomerular resistance is  protective of glomeruli, whereas decreased resistance with increased pressure  and/or flow is injurious.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - Postoperative intrarenal pressure measurements may be an aid to the diagnosis of acute renal transplant rejection, especially in patients treated with  cyclosporine. Serial measurements of intrarenal pressure were made in 38  recipients using a fine-needle technique. Thirty-two intraoperative and 207  postoperative measurements were made, and 39 clinical rejection episodes (23  confirmed by biopsy) monitored. Intraoperative pressures in grafts with immediate  function (37.4 +/- 4.0 mmHg, mean +/- SEM) were not significantly different from  those with delayed function (30.9 +/- 4.8 mmHg), whereas postoperative pressures  were greater (P less than 0.01) in kidneys with acute tubular necrosis (29.4 +/-  1.9 mmHg) than in functioning grafts (20.4 +/- 0.9 mmHg). Pressures recorded  during clinical rejection episodes (44.3 +/- 2.3 mmHg) exceeded (P less than  0.001) those during quiescent periods (23.6 +/- 1.0 mmHg). During rejection  episodes, higher pressures (P less than 0.01) were recorded from tender or  palpably enlarged grafts (52.5 +/- 3.0 mmHg) than in the absence of these signs  (36.3 +/- 3.1 mmHg), and patients whose transplants biopsies showed cellular  rejection tended to have greater pressures (50.1 +/- 4.1 mmHg) than those with  concomitant vasculopathy (36.4 +/- 3.9 mmHg), but the latter did not reach  statistical significance. In 7 cases of cyclosporine toxicity the intrarenal  pressure was 17.8 +/- 4.2 mmHg. Using a diagnostic cut off point of 40 mmHg, the  investigation failed to recognize 26% of acute rejection episodes--and, in the  presence of acute tubular necrosis, it wrongly categorized 21% of nonrejectors.  While its predictive capacity was limited, the test may occasionally be helpful  in the differentiation of cyclosporine toxicity and rejection in functioning  kidneys.

AB  - To examine the effect of intermittent endotoxemia on rat pulmonary artery structure and hemodynamic function we infused purified Escherichia coli endotoxin  on four occasions over 3 weeks (at 7-day intervals), through an indwelling  catheter placed in the external jugular vein. The fourth infusion of endotoxin  was associated with widespread but focal alveolar consolidation, reduced  perfusion of small pulmonary arteries by lumen occlusion and obliteration,  pulmonary vascular wall injury, and a peripheral leukocytosis (mean +/- SEM total  leukocytes, endotoxin 133.5 +/- 23 X 10 mm3, control 12.2 +/- 1.2 X 10 mm3, p  less than 0.001) in which polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes predominated at the  expense of lymphocytes (p2x less than 0.01). The alveolar wall was thickened and  the alveolar space was consolidated by degenerating polymorphonuclear leukocytes,  mononuclear cells, lipid laden alveolar macrophages, erythrocytes, fibrin, and  cell debris. In regions of alveolar consolidation vessel lumens were either  narrowed by subendothelial cell collections that consisted either of mononuclear  cells or degenerating mural and inflammatory cells, or they were occluded by  degenerating inflammatory cells and cell debris. The walls of occluded vessels  were evident only by their residual elastic laminae: remnants of lysed  endothelial cells lined the intima and the media consisted of degenerating mural  and inflammatory cells. Capillary endothelial cells showed extensive hydropic  degeneration and lysis of cell contents. Intimal precursor smooth muscle cells  were hypertrophied but were not associated with the appearance of mature smooth  muscle cells in the walls of small pulmonary arteries. In regions of less severe  alveolar consolidation by inflammatory cells, vessel wall injury was still  evident but less marked; precursor smooth muscle cells were hypertrophied;  subepithelial and subendothelial collections of fluid and fibrin were present;  and plasma membranes of endothelial cells were disrupted. Despite extensive  pulmonary vascular injury, chronic intermittent endotoxemia did not produce the  structural changes associated with pulmonary hypertension (medial thickening and  appearance of medial muscle in previously nonmuscular arteries) nor a significant  change in pulmonary artery pressure.

AB  - Mutagenicity testing can be used to assay faeces for genotoxic substances and the results are reported to correlate with population risk for colorectal cancer  (Ehrich et al., 1979). It has been suggested that histidine in faeces may cause  false positive results (Venitt and Bosworth, 1983). To determine the relationship  between histidine and false positive mutagenicity assays aliquots of  non-mutagenic faecal extract and saline were supplemented with histidine and  subjected to the Ames Salmonella/mammalian microsome mutagenicity assay (Ames et  al., 1975). Using high-pressure liquid chromatography the analytical recovery of  histidine from water and faecal extract supplemented with histidine was  equivalent (r = 0.998, p less than 0.001). Histidine was measured in faecal  extracts (1 in 10 dilutions) from 35 volunteers, 10 patients with inflammatory  bowel disease and 4 with rectal cancer. These extracts were also assayed for  mutagens using the Salmonella/mammalian microsome mutagenicity assay. None of the  faecal extracts gave mutagenicity ratios above 2. Faecal extracts from volunteers  were free of detectable histidine. Although 9 of those from inflammatory bowel  disease patients contained histidine (mean +/- SEM 255 +/- 34 mumoles l-1) as did  1 extract from a rectal cancer patient (50 mumoles l-1), none contained  sufficient histidine to give a false positive Salmonella/mammalian microsome  mutagenicity assay result (800 mumoles l-1 in test solution). Our results do not  implicate histidine as a cause of error in faecal mutagenicity testing by the  Salmonella/mammalian microsome mutagenicity assay.

AB  - Criteria indicating injury of endothelial cells (craters, protrusion, denudation) in saphenous veins for aorto-coronary bypass grafting have been examined and  quantitated by use of light-(LM), scanning electron (SEM) and transmission  electron microscopy (TEM). The specimens were fixed either by immersion or under  pressure. It was shown that the conventional way of handling saphenous vein  grafts prior to implantation results in serious damage of the endothelial lining.  The factors responsible are presumed to be hypoxia, manual flushing and  distension with isotonic saline for blood removal, control of leakage, and  counteracting spasm of the graft. Even samples collected by a "no touch"  technique and exposed to a short hypoxic interval sometimes revealed slight  injury.

AB  - The effects of lipoxygenase enzyme inhibitor nafazatrom on infarct size, haemodynamics, and prostanoid release was studied in a canine  occlusion-reperfusion model of ischaemic myocardial injury. Treatment was with 10  mg/kg nafazatrom i.d., starting before coronary occlusion, 2 h and 6 h  thereafter, and was repeated in 6 h intervals. The left anterior descending (LAD)  coronary artery was occluded for 6 h and reperfused for 42 h. Infarct size and  anatomic area dependent on the occluded LAD were determined post mortem by the  tetrazolium staining technique. Nafazatrom significantly reduced the extent of  irreversible myocardial ischaemic damage whether it was expressed as g/100 g left  ventricle (24 +/- 4 vs. 46 +/- 6 in controls; p less than 0.01; mean +/- SEM) or  as percentage of LAD risk region for infarcting (38 +/- 8 vs. 65 +/- 7% in  controls; p less than 0.05). Nafazatrom did not affect peripheral haemodynamics  but during drug vehicle treatment and LAD occlusion systemic blood pressure, left  ventricular pressure and dP/dtmax decreased while filling pressure, heart rate,  and the S-T segments of the ECG increased. The incidence of ventricular  fibrillation was 8% during drug treatment and coronary ligature vs. 25% in  controls (n.s.). During reperfusion, nafazatrom reduced the incidence of  ventricular premature contractions and tachycardia. Ex vivo platelet aggregation  in response to collagen was not inhibited by nafazatrom. Prostanoid release  (thromboxane B2 and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha as breakdown products of  thromboxane A2 and prostacyclin, respectively) remained unaltered in vehicle  controls but nafazatrom treatment elevated prostacyclin release significantly at  4 and 5 h during LAD occlusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - Percutaneous transtracheal ventilation (PTV) is an active airway management technique that may be an alternative to cricothyroidotomy in critically injured  patients. A canine trauma model was devised to compare the ventilatory capacity  and hemodynamic effects of PTV to endotracheal intubation. Mongrel dogs (25-37  kg), splenectomized 14 days previously, were anesthetized with pentobarbital and  bled to a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 20 mm Hg. Animals were maintained at  this MAP for 1 hour, then resuscitated with simultaneous: a) aortic crossclamping  via left thoracotomy, b) Ringer's lactate infusion, and c) active airway support.  Control animals (N = 5), intubated with a cuffed endotracheal tube, were  ventilated at a rate of 12 per minute, a tidal volume of 500 cc and an FIO2 of  60%. In study animals (N = 5), PTV, for a duration of 1 second, was instituted at  the same rate and FIO2. There was no statistically significant difference between  the two groups with regard to pO2, pCO2, pH, and hemodynamic parameters. PTV was  also performed in the emergency department on four patients unresponsive to  resuscitative thoracotomy for postinjury cardiac arrest. PTV rate was 12/minute;  duration, 1 second; and FIO2, 100%. Mean values (+/- SEM) for pH, pO2, and pCO2  obtained after 15 minutes of PTV were 7.14 +/- 0.03, 322 +/- 49.5 torr, and 21.5  +/- 4.7 torr, respectively. PTV is comparable to endotracheal intubation with  respect to oxygenation, ventilation and hemodynamic response (p greater than  0.05). Our preliminary clinical study corroborates its efficacy in the acute  trauma setting and supports further clinical investigation.

AB  - The role of advanced trauma life support (ATLS) in the prehospital care of the critically injured is highly controversial. This study analyzes the efficacy of  ATLS in the management of critical penetrating wounds of the thorax and abdomen.  In the 2 1/2-year period ending July 1984, 203 consecutive patients underwent  emergency laparotomy or thoracotomy for gunshot and stab wounds. All patients  were treated in the field by advanced paramedics (EMT-P). For gunshot wounds the  mean time (+/- S.E.M.) responding to the scene was 4.5 (+/- 0.29) minutes, on the  scene 10.1 (+/- 0.41) minutes, and returning to the hospital 6.4 (+/- 0.32)  minutes. For stab wounds the mean time responding to the scene was 4.8 (+/- 0.21)  minutes, on the scene 9.5 (+/- 0.37) minutes, and returning to the hospital 5.7  (+ 0.30) minutes. The number of intravenous lines started averaged 1.8 per  patient. Eighty-one patients had PASG applied and 28 patients underwent  endotracheal intubation (21 orally, seven nasally). Thirty-three patients had no  obtainable blood pressure, of whom six survived (18%). One hundred sixty (94%) of  the remaining 170 patients who had any initial blood pressure survived. One  hundred nine (55%) patients had an increase in BP greater than or equal to 10 mm  Hg (average, 35.6 mm Hg), 64 (32%) had no significant change, and 25 (13%) had a  fall greater than or equal to 10 mm Hg (average, 24.2 mm Hg) from the field to  the emergency department. Twenty (80%) of the 25 patients with a fall in blood  pressure survived.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - The effects of 124 boluses of etomidate 0.2 mg kg-1 i.v. on intracranial pressure (ICP), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) were  studied in eight patients with severe head injury (Glasgow coma score less than  8). The data were divided into two groups based on the minimum voltage of the  cerebral function monitor (CFM) recording before the bolus. In group A this was  less than 5 microV (representing profound cortical electrical depression), while  in group B the minimum voltage was greater than 5 microV. The mean decrease in  ICP following etomidate was significantly greater in group B (mean +/- SEM: -8.6  +/- 0.7 mm Hg) than in group A (-3.8 +/- 0.6 mm Hg) (P less than 0.0001). The  decrease in arterial pressure was similar in both groups. Consequently, there was  a small mean increase in CPP in group B (2.2 +/- 0.9 mm Hg), whereas in group A  CPP decreased (-4.7 +/- 1.5 mm Hg) (P less than 0.001). There was a strong  correlation between the decreases in ICP and MAP in group A (r = 0.70, P less  than 0.01), but not in group B (r = 0.05). Thus, when cortical electrical  activity was already maximally suppressed, further administration of an i.v.  anaesthetic agent produced only relatively small decreases in ICP, largely as a  passive response to decreases in MAP. CPP was therefore usually reduced.  Conversely, in the absence of such depression larger decreases in ICP, unrelated  to hypotension, occurred and these were usually associated with increases in CPP.  However, even under these circumstances, potentially dangerous decreases in CPP  may be seen.

T2  - Life sciences
AB  - Brain injury has been commonly associated with respiratory failure and uncontrolled skeletal muscle activity. In the present study, neuromuscular (NM)  blockade induced by injection of succinylcholine hydrochloride was used to block  uncontrolled muscle contractions in dogs with brain injury caused by rapid  elevation of intracranial pressure (ICP). Decerebrate posturing, a decrease in  value (mean +/- SEM) of arterial oxygen tension (Pa02) of 26 +/- 1 torr, and an  increase in arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) of 11 +/- 1 torr occurred in  the dogs, which were supported by mechanical ventilation. The arterial hypoxemia  developed independently of the decerebration; however, dogs that demonstrated  decerebrate posturing exhibited significantly larger decreases in Pa02 than dogs  that did not (P less than 0.01). NM blockade ameliorated the effects of elevated  ICP on the arterial blood gases; i.e., the amount of hypoxemia in decerebrate  dogs was significantly less in dogs subjected to NM blockade than in dogs not  subjected to NM blockade. It is concluded that uncontrolled skeletal muscle  activity that exacerbates arterial hypoxemia associated with brain injury is  ameliorated by use of NM blockade as a therapeutic adjunct to mechanical  ventilation.

AB  - Adult respiratory distress syndrome has been reported after endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy with sodium morrhuate. It has been proposed that sclerosant  entering the pulmonary circulation during intravariceal injections may cause  pulmonary hypertension and capillary injury. The purpose of this study was to  determine whether variceal sclerotherapy with sodium morrhuate causes capillary  injury or pulmonary edema in humans. We studied the effect of sclerotherapy on  gas exchange and pulmonary and systemic hemodynamics in 8 patients who required  endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy for treatment of variceal hemorrhage. The  pulmonary vascular resistance index increased from 246 +/- 67 dyn X s X cm-5/m2  (mean +/- SEM) at baseline to a high of 303 +/- 85 dyn X s X cm-5/m2 60 min after  sclerotherapy (normal range 250-500 dyn X s X cm-5/m2). Pulmonary artery pressure  remained stable while cardiac index decreased by 12% over the same period. There  were also small increases in systemic vascular resistance index and systemic  arterial pressure after sclerotherapy. Although there was no change in arterial  oxygen tension, the alveolar-arterial oxygen difference improved after  sclerotherapy. These results indicate that variceal sclerotherapy with sodium  morrhuate is associated with clinically insignificant changes in pulmonary and  systemic hemodynamics. We did not detect evidence of acute lung injury after  sclerotherapy.

AB  - Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) has been shown to be present and have actions in the human gastrointestinal tract. We have studied urine TRH immunoreactivity  (TRH-ir) levels in healthy subjects and patients with acute pancreatitis,  gallstones, ulcerative colitis, or acute gastritis. The urine samples were  prepurified by SP-Sephadex-C-25 cation exchange chromatography, subjected to  reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography, and assayed in our TRH  radioimmunoassay. The mean urine TRH immunoreactivity values of healthy subjects  were 4.42 +/- 1 ng/l (x +/- SEM); of patients with acute pancreatitis on the 1st  day of hospitalization, 23 +/- 7 ng/l; on the 2nd day, 7 +/- 1 ng/l; and on the  3rd day 9 +/- 2 ng/l. Only the urine TRH levels of the pancreatitis patients on  day 1 differed significantly (p less than 0.05) from the levels of the healthy  subjects. Circulating TRH appears to be derived mostly from the pancreas, where  the islets during acute pancreatitis are affected, and TRH is released into  circulation and urine.

AB  - Electromyographic detection of increased neuromuscular conduction latency that follows electrostimulation of spinal nerves has been used widely as a clinical  tool for detection of ischemic muscle injury. We hypothesized that a biochemical  marker for stagnant hypoxia provides more direct evidence for evaluating severity  and monitoring resolution of ischemic muscle injury than the EMG. To detect  intracellular changes in oxygen use during experimental ischemia, ultrathin  sections of rat gastrocnemius muscle were treated with reducing agent,  3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB), a histochemical marker for intramitochondrial  cytochrome oxidase activity. The observed decrease in mitochondrial uptake of DAB  suggested that a decrease in cytochrome oxidase activity was associated with  experimental ischemia. Neuromuscular conduction latency in rat gastrocnemius  muscle was also quantitated after electrostimulation of the sciatic nerve.  Ligation of the femoral artery produced ischemic tissue injury, during which  recordings of the EMG showed that conduction latency increased [from a mean +/-  SEM control value of 3.09 +/- 0.13 to 3.92 +/- 0.22 ms (N = 11, P less than  0.001).] The changes in both histochemically detectable cytochrome oxidase  activity and neuromuscular conduction latency were reversed by reperfusion.  Response of the rat tissue to arterial occlusion was thereby shown to be a  physiologic model for skeletal muscle response to ischemia. In addition,  histochemical detection of cytochrome oxidase activity was shown to be a  sensitive intracellular marker for decreased oxygen use during ischemic muscle  injury.

AB  - An isolated rat heart preparation was reperfused at 37 degrees C for 10 min after 10, 20, 30 and 40 min of ischaemia. The left ventricular tension was measured by  means of a balloon catheter filled with water and connected to a pressure  recorder. The left ventricular resting tension began to increase at 9 +/- 1 min  (mean +/- SEM) and was maximally developed (myocardial contracture) at 18 +/- 1  min of ischaemia. There was a striking and constant exacerbation of the resting  tension during reperfusion after 30 and 40 min (but not after 10 or 20 min) of  ischaemia with simultaneous acceleration of creatine phosphokinase (CK) release  into the coronary effluent and with the loss of the recovery of contractile  activity. Myocardial adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-content decreased during 20 min  of ischaemia more in the endocardial (ENDO) (from 17.7 +/- 1.9 mumol/g to 0.7 +/-  0.1 mumol/g) than in epicardial (EPI) (from 15.5 +/- 0.9 mumol/g to 3.2 +/- 0.6  mumol/g) parts of myocardium. Reperfusion after 10 min of ischaemia resulted in a  slight increase of myocardial ATP-content both in EPI (from 7.5 +/- 0.6 to 10.4  +/- 0.8 mumol/g, p less than 0.05) and ENDO (from 5.0 +/- 0.8 to 8.9 +/- 2.5  mumol/g, n.s.). Reperfusion after the completion of contracture (after 20 min)  had no effect on myocardial ATP-content. The results indicate that there is a  transmural ATP gradient in ischaemic isolated rat heart and that myocardial ATP  net production during reperfusion (10 min) is prevented after the development of  ischaemic contracture.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AU  - Cheney, F. W.
T2  - The American review of respiratory disease
AB  - The mechanism by which hydralazine increases venous admixture (QVA/QT) in the setting of lung injury was investigated in a canine model of noncardiogenic  pulmonary edema. Permeability pulmonary edema was produced by administration of  oleic acid, 0.08 ml/kg given intravenously to 9 mongrel dogs. After stabilization  of lung injury, hydralazine was administered intravenously in a loading dose of 1  mg/kg and followed by a constant infusion at 0.05 mg/kg/h. To control for the  effect of increased cardiac output (QT) on QVA/QT, a balloon catheter was placed  in the inferior vena cava, and stepwise inflation of the balloon was used to  impede venous return and maintain QT at predrug levels. Prior to inflation of the  balloon catheter, administration of hydralazine produced a 51% decrease in total  systemic resistance (TSR) and a 23% decrease in mean arterial pressure (Pa). In  contrast, pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) showed no significant change, and  mean pulmonary artery pressure (Ppa) increased 47%. Cardiac output increased from  3.4 +/- 0.3 to 5.5 +/- 0.4 L/min (mean +/- SEM; p less than 0.01) after  administration of hydralazine, and QVA/QT increased from 23 +/- 7 to 35 +/- 5% (p  less than 0.05). Mean arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) showed no significant  change. Inflation of the balloon in the inferior vena cava after hydralazine  administration reduced QT to 3.1 +/- 0.4 L/min and QVA/QT to 28 +/- 4%. Neither  of these values differed significantly from the prehydralazine levels. Similarly,  values for Ppa and PVR after hydralazine administration plus balloon inflation  did not differ significantly from predrug levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250  WORDS)

AB  - A new chromatographic procedure is proposed for measuring 3 methyl-L-histidine (3 MH) in human urine. The sample was purified on a cation-exchange resin (AGR  50W-X4) and analysed by ion exchange high performance liquid chromatography on a  PARTISIL 10 SCX Whatman column in UV light at 210 nm within 16 min. This  procedure gave similar outputs of 3 MH to those described in human normal urine  (mean +/- SEM = 213 +/- 15 mumol X 24 h-1, n = 19). It was used to measure the  urinary outputs of 3 MH of five patients admitted to an intensive surgical care  unit, for 48, 28, 25, 15 and 10 days, respectively. The urinary outputs of 3 MH  were normal or lower than normal. The 10(3) urinary 3 MH/creatinine molar ratios  were also calculated; this new 3 MH analysis could help the reanimator to  prescribe an adequate nutritional assessment.

AB  - Acute respiratory failure in humans often follows extrathoracic sepsis. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of repeated episodes of  intra-abdominal sepsis over several weeks on the structure and function of rat  lung. Intermittent peritonitis and a bacteremia of Escherichia coli and  Bacteroides fragilis were produced by weekly intra-abdominal implants of gelatin  capsules containing these organisms (3.0 +/- 1.0 X 10(7) and 5.0 +/- 1.0 X 10(7)  colony-forming units/ml, respectively; mean +/- SEM). After 4 weeks alveolar  walls were thickened and cellular with focal areas of alveolar space  consolidation: circulating polymorphonuclear leukocytes were increased (12.2 +/-  1.2 to 19.9 +/- 2.0 X 10(3)/mm3; p less than 0.05), as were plasma levels of  6-keto-PGF1 alpha (0.56 +/- 0.08 to 1.02 +/- 0.18 ng/ml; p less than 0.01). After  8 weeks the capillary bed was dilated and the alveolar walls and ducts appeared  less cellular but showed fibrosis: The WBC count had increased to 25.5 +/- 1.0 X  10(3) (p less than 0.01). After 4 or 8 weeks of intermittent sepsis there was no  increase in the pulmonary artery pressure or vascular resistance or any change in  arterial oxygen tension, plasma thromboxane beta 2 level, or platelet count. We  conclude that repeated bouts of sepsis and bacteremia in the rat cause  progressive injury to lung alveoli without evidence of altered blood gas tensions  or pulmonary hemodynamics.

AU  - Becker, J. M.
T2  - Archives of surgery (Chicago, Ill. : 1960)
AB  - Anal sphincter function in patients before and after colectomy, mucosal proctectomy, and endorectal ileoanal pull-through was assessed prospectively. In  21 patients with ulcerative colitis, Gardner's syndrome, or familial polyposis,  anorectal manometry was performed before and eight weeks after ileoanal  pull-through. The mean +/- SEM maximal anal sphincter resting pressure decreased  from 86 +/- 5 to 68 +/- 4 mm Hg after operation. The net change in pressure with  squeeze, however, was greater after ileoanal pull-through than before operation  (100 +/- 9 v 92 +/- 7 mm Hg). In 19 of 21 patients after operation, balloon  dilation of the ileal pouch resulted in relaxation of the internal anal sphincter  and contraction of the external anal sphincter. Mean +/- SEM 24-hour stool  frequency decreased from 7.6 +/- 0.6 at one month to 6.2 +/- 0.5 at three months.  It was concluded that ileoanal pull-through preserves continence and an  acceptable stool frequency by maintaining nearly normal anal sphincter function.

T2  - La semaine des hopitaux : organe fonde par l'Association d'enseignement medical des hopitaux de Paris
AB  - The authors report a series of 67 patients presenting with 103 decubitus ulcers, treated between 1969 and 1977, and with a follow-up of one year or more. The  majority of the patients were paraplegics, other etiologies being present in  smaller numbers and raising different problems. They first studied the importance  of the pre-and post-operative treatment. This was followed by study of the  importance of different surgical techniques for each of the three localizations  (sacral, ischial and trochanteric). They demonstrated the absolute need for  surgical management, especially with paraplegic patients. Surgery alone allows  rapid healing with a high success rate. While it does not, however, preclude any  possibility of recurrence (whatever the technique used), it does at least allow  the patient to live a normal life. The authors further emphasize the importance  of the preoperative treatment, using the nutripump, and the postoperative  treatment, using the pulsating air bed (in preference to the water bed). They  consider the nutripump to be the most important breakthrough in this field, in  recent years. As regards the different localizations, they consider muscle or  musculocutaneous flaps to be the treatment of choice for ischial ulcers, but  stress the need for wide ischiectomy and the excision of the bursa. In their  experience, insufficient excision is a source of failure, even if the flap is  good. Similarly, musculocutaneous flaps offer the best solution for trochanteric  ulcers, but again, only accompanied by excision of the bursa. Recognition of  coxofemoral arthritis is also essential, and no flap will take until this has  been remedied. In the case of sacral ulcers, however, they prefer large rotation  skin flaps, which allow further advancement in the event of recurrence. The  association of two or three ulcers makes surgical management imperative because  of the frequently severe undermining of the patient's general state of health.  The treatment of two locations in a single stage is always preferable whenever it  is feasible.

AB  - On the grounds of studies carried out in the last ten years, the authors criticize the usual classification of comas and question the Glasgow scale  (opening of eyes, verbal answer, motor response). Their description of brain stem  injury by axial herniation and explanation of the role of diffuse encephalic  lesions causing intracranial hypertension is based upon anatomo-clinical findings  and results of investigations in comatose patients with head injury. For  prognostic purposes, a simple and fairly reliable classification of  post-traumatic comas is proposed. Comas are divided into five stages of  rostro-caudal destructuration (cortico-sub-cortical, diencephalic,  meso-diencephalic, mesencephalic and pontic) by studying the response to pain  (unadapted, adapted, absent) and four brain stem reflexes (fronto-orbicular,  vertical and horizontal oculocephalic, light reflexes).

T2  - Circulation
AB  - Recurrent myocardial ischemia is commonly seen in patients with coronary artery disease, in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with intermittent cross-clamping,  and experimentally when multiple occlusion preparations are used to test drugs.  Our study was designated to investigate whether myocardial injury is cumulative  after three sequential ischemic episodes. Sixteen dogs were instrumented with  ultrasonic crystals to assess percentage of segmental shortening and percentage  of wall thickening in ischemic and nonischemic regions. The left anterior  descending coronary artery was occluded three times for 5 min in one group (n =  8) and three times for 15 min in another group of dogs (n = 8) and each occlusion  was followed by 30 min of reflow. Blood flow was determined with microspheres  before coronary artery occlusion in the 5 min group and during occlusion in the  15 min group and in all dogs 25 min into the first and third reperfusion periods.  During the three reperfusion periods mean segmental shortening in the ischemic  zone recovered to only 60.5 +/- 8.7% (+/- SEM) of the preocclusion level (p less  than .003) in the 5 min occlusion group and to 36.9 +/- 17.7% in the 15 min  occlusion group (p less than .01). Mean wall thickening recovered to 61.3 +/-  16.6% (p less than .06) in the 5 min group and to 48.6 +/- 11.8% in the 15 min  group (p less than .004). There were no significant differences during the  reperfusion phase when mean values for the ischemic segment after the second and  third occlusion were compared with the data obtained after the first occlusion in  either group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - Effects of 13-hydroperoxy linoleic acid on coronary circulation and vasculature were investigated using an electrocardiographic (ECG) and scanning electron  microscopic (SEM) techniques. After the intra left ventricular injection of  13-hydroperoxy linoleic acid to rats the ischemic ECG changes, i.e., elevations  of the ST segment and T wave, were observed with the reduction of systemic blood  pressure and heart rate. By the SEM examination, the endothelial injuries were  found with the platelet aggregation in the blood flow and the adherence of  leukocytes. Thus it was clearly found that 13-hydroperoxy linoleic acid caused  the various endothelial injuries and thrombus formation leading to coronary  arterial occlusion. These results suggest that lipid peroxide may play an  important role in the pathogenesis of vascular diseases especially in coronary  vascular bed and take part in the generation of the severe myocardial ischemia.

T2  - The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism
AB  - The function of the pituitary-adrenal axis was studied in 23 acutely brain-injured, comatose patients (14 head trauma and 9 intracranial hemorrhage),  who were treated with dexamethasone (16-64 mg/daily). Patients with normal  intracranial pressure (ICP) and normal brain stem function (group 1) had  decreased plasma cortisol levels (less than or equal to 5 micrograms/dl) within  36 h (mean +/- SEM, 2.4 +/- 0.3 microgram/dl; t 1/2, 18 h). In contrast, patients  with elevated ICP (i.e. greater than 20 mm Hg; midline shift, or compressed  ventricles) and normal brain stem function (group 2) had persistently elevated  cortisol concentrations (15.4 +/- 2.6 micrograms/dl; P less than 0.001).  Superimposition of brain stem dysfunction resulted in generally low cortisol  levels regardless of the presence (group 4; 3.9 +/- 1.0 microgram/dl; P less than  0.001 compared to group 2) or absence (group 3; 2.1 +/- 0.5 microgram/dl) of  elevated ICP. Plasma ACTH levels in 31 samples obtained before or during  dexamethasone therapy in 14 patients irrespective of group were not elevated  (45.6 +/- 12.5 pg/ml); there was no correlation between plasma ACTH and cortisol  levels. Despite elevated cortisol values in group 2, ACTH levels were low (22.4  +/- 10.1 pg/ml). It is concluded that elevated ICP in the presence of normal  brain stem function is a potent stimulus for adrenocortical activation which is  not associated with elevated ACTH levels, and that the brain stem is involved in  this response.

T2  - The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics
AB  - The antithrombotic efficacy of prostacyclin (PGI2) when administered in conjunction with the phosphodiesterase inhibitor aminophylline was evaluated in a  canine model in which coronary artery thrombosis was induced by electrical  stimulation of the intimal surface of the left circumflex (LCX) coronary artery.  Infusions of PGI2 (25 or 50 ng/kg/min) into the left atrial appendage and  aminophylline (20 micrograms/kg/min) or ethylene diamine into the left jugular  vein were initiated 10 min before the start of LCX coronary artery stimulation  and continued for the 6-hr stimulation period. Every animal in the control (Tris  buffer plus ethylene diamine, n = 7), PGI2 (25 ng/kg/min) only (n = 6) and  aminophylline only (n = 7) groups developed completely occlusive coronary artery  thrombi. In contrast, none of the animals receiving PGI2 (25 ng/kg/min) plus  aminophylline or PGI2 (50 ng/kg/min) plus aminophylline underwent occlusive  thrombus formation. The average thrombus mass developed in response to intimal  injury of the LCX coronary artery was 57 +/- 14 mg (X +/- S.E.M.) in the control  group. Aminophylline administration in conjunction with PGI2 infusion at doses of  25 and 50 ng/kg/min significantly reduced thrombus mass to 11 +/- 2 and 10 +/- 1  mg, respectively (P less than .05). PGI2 (25 ng/kg/min) plus aminophylline  reduced mean arterial pressure by 12% from 116 +/- 5 to 102 +/- 4 mm Hg. These  data demonstrate that the combined administration of aminophylline with low-dose  PGI2 provides antithrombotic efficacy while minimizing the detrimental  hemodynamic effects of large-dose PGI2 administration.

The most significant clinical sign of aortic  rupture is the difference in blood pressure between the upper and lower limbs.  The frequency of chest film findings is discussed. The aortography by arterial  route must be performed at the sligh test suspicion, sometimes without  radiographic signs, to establish diagnostics and detect associated lesions  (dissection) and unusual types (low localization, multiple localization,  localized rupture of the intima.

AB  - The ileal pouch-anal anastomosis improves clinical results after colectomy and mucosal proctectomy compared to the straight ileoanal anastomosis. The question  was what physiologic changes brought about by the pouch led to the improvement.  Among 124 patients who had had ileoanal anastomosis, 25 volunteered for a  detailed clinicophysiologic evaluation. Fourteen had had the ileal pouch-anal  operation a mean of 8 months previously, and 11 had the straight ileoanal  operation a mean of 25 months previously. Both groups of patients had  satisfactory anal sphincter resting pressures (mean +/- SEM, pouch = 68 +/- 8 cm  H2O, straight = 65 +/- 9 cm H2O, p greater than 0.05) and neorectal capacities  (pouch = 278 +/- 26 ml, straight = 233 +/- 36 ml, p less than 0.05), and all  could evacuate spontaneously. However, the pouch patients had a more distensible  neorectum (delta V/delta P pouch = 9.5 +/- 1.3 ml/cm H2O, straight = 4.9 +/- 0.9  ml/cm H2O, p less than 0.05) and smaller amplitude neorectal contractions (pouch  = 36 +/- 5 cm H2O, straight = 90 +/- 13 cm H2O; p less than 0.05). We concluded  that the pouch-anal anastomosis increased the distensibility of the neorectum and  decreased its propulsive drive, and so improved clinical results.

Acute intracranial  hypertension, whether isolated or associated with neurological signs or fever, is  the principal emergency indication. Its main causes are posterior fossa tumors,  but other space-occupying lesions may be found. The main radiological features in  each etiology are described. Hemorrhage and trauma are the other essential  emergency indications. Emergency CT examination can also be performed in  unexplained coma. The indications of CT and ultrasonography in neonates are  discussed.

T2  - The Journal of clinical investigation
AB  - To assess the metabolic recovery of mitochondria after injury, we have monitored, in vivo and noninvasively, changes in the redox state of cytochrome (cyt) a,a3 in  35 rats after tissue hypoxia induced by rapid exsanguination to a mean arterial  pressure of 30-35 mmHg. This level of mean arterial pressure was maintained for a  shorter period of time in group I (n = 17) and a longer period of time in group  II (n = 18), then the shed blood was returned by infusion. The surviving animals  were observed for 2 more h before terminating the experiments. During  exsanguination, reinfusion and recovery intervals brain tissue parameters of  blood oxygenation, relative blood volume, and cyt a,a3 redox state were monitored  continuously by spectrophotometry through the closed skull and intact skin. Group  I had a high survival rate while group II had a very low survival rate. In both  groups, with the onset of hypotension, there was a prompt rapid shift, followed  by a slow continued progressive shift, of cyt a,a3 toward a more reduced state.  The extent of recovery of cyt a,a3 following reinfusion was different in each  group. In group I there was a rapid reoxidation of cyt a,a3 to a level above the  base line (16 +/- 12%, mean +/- SEM). In contrast, the extent of reoxidation of  cyt a,a3 in group II was significantly lower and stayed 31 +/- 6% below the  base-line level. To further evaluate the mechanisms responsible for these  observations, another related experiment was performed. 12 rats were subjected to  shock and resuscitation as outlined for groups I and II. After death or killing  of the animal, we measured, in vitro, oxygen consumption of cerebral cortical  slices. Oxygen consumption of cortical tissue slices in subgroup I was  significantly higher than in subgroup II. We conclude that, under these  experimental conditions, the oxidative response of cyt a,a3 correlates closely  with survival or death in the two groups. If in group I animals the greater  oxidation of cyt a,a3, in vivo after resuscitation, reflects greater oxygen  utilization, as is suggested by the in vitro observations in subgroup I, then we  may be observing a useful adaptive response to tissue injury leading to preserved  organ function and enhanced survival. Therefore, noninvasively measured cyt a,a3  redox state, reflecting intracellular metabolic activity, seems to indicate both  the overall cerebral cellular response to injury and the likelihood of survival.

AB  - Seven patients had severe deep venous insufficiency and recurrent ulceration in eight lower extremities. All incompetent perforating veins had been previously  ligated. All limbs were evaluated by dynamic venous pressure measurements. The  venous pressure reduction with exercise was recorded, as well as the recovery  time. The most accurate indicator of venous valvular incompetence was a short  postexercise recovery time. Abnormal hemodynamic findings were correlated with  ascending and descending venographic findings. Based on these anatomic and  pathophysiologic abnormalities, patients underwent valvular transposition,  superficial femoral vein valvuloplasty, or superficial femoral vein ligation.  Immediate postoperative recovery time (mean +/- SEM) was improved to 34.5 +/-  18.3 s from 7.9 +/- 2.9 s preoperatively. Postoperative venography demonstrated  patency of all anastomoses and absence of reflux into previously incompetent  venous systems. All limbs were symptomatically improved after operation, and no  venous thrombosis or pulmonary emboll developed. Persistent ulceration, however,  continued in one limb.

T2  - Japanese heart journal
AB  - This study was conducted to determine whether or not a low concentration of carboxyhemoglobin influences the extent and severity of myocardial ischemia  caused by coronary ligation. In 10 dogs, electrograms were recorded from 6  epicardial electrodes mounted on the anterior surface of the left ventricle and  distributed over the area normally perfused by the lighted branch of the left  anterior descending coronary artery. The magnitude of ST segment elevation of the  6 sites in each animal was determined for 15 min after ligation. This elevation  was used as an index of the presence and severity of myocardial ischemic injury.  Ligation alone increased sigma ST elevation, summed from 6 sites, from 2.06 +/-  0.34 mV (SEM) to 24.89 +/- 2.14 mV (SEM). Carbon monoxide inhaled prior to  ligation increased the severity and extent of ischemic injury and the magnitude  of ST segment elevation in the area peripheral to the ischemic area more than did  ligation alone. These changes occurred without elevation of heart rate or  arterial pressure. It was concluded that a low background concentration of  carboxyhemoglobin at the time of ligation increased the extent and severity of  myocardial ischemic injury.

AB  - Acute pulmonary edema is a frequent complication of carbon monoxide poisoning. The hemodynamic study of a case with major hypoxemia revealed the cardiac origin  of the acute respiratory failure. Treatment associated diuretics, cardiotonic  drugs and a positive end expiratory pressure. This treatment did not however  prevent the occurrence of a transient anterolateral injury on EKG. The  pathophysiology of pulmonary edema in carbon monoxide poisoning is discussed and  evidence in favor of it's hemodynamic origin are exposed.

AU  - Böhm, E.
T2  - Scanning electron microscopy
AB  - The fine-structural analysis of injuries and injury-related damages of the arteries in the head and neck region, such as vital endothelial injuries  resulting from death by hanging, is of considerable importance in legal medicine,  as it involves numerous forensic problems. The problems and difficulties of  vessel preparation, including the occurrence of artefacts, have been widely  discussed in medical journals, indicating the necessity for a special method of  preparation to be developed. This method has to take individual differences of  the autopsy material into consideration, including osmolarity changes caused by  hypoxia, and autolysis. The method developed by us and described here meets these  conditions. Optimization and standardization of the method was achieved by  perfusion fixation of the vascular system in situ. The particular characteristics  of the vessels involved made it necessary to open the skull. After removing the  upper half of the brain and applying a partially permeable sealing to the skull  base, we proceeded with the perfusion, using slightly hyperosmotic perfusion  media (450-680 mOsm) via a hydrostatic system, and keeping pressure and flow  rates low (max. 65 cm H2O). The perfusion technique we developed, and which is  described in detail, has proven suitable for the preparation of other vessels as  well, which is demonstrated on the venae cerebri superiores. The method of  preparation was designed to provide conditions for a routine application of SEM,  LM and TEM for forensic purposes.

AB  - The effects of prostaglandin E1 infusion on nailfold capillary haemodynamics were studied in eight patients with Raynaud's phenomenon secondary to progressive  systemic sclerosis. Using a modified Landis microinjection technique the mean  (+/- SEM) transcapillary pressure gradient was increased during and six weeks  after infusion by 13.9 +/- 3.2 cm H2O (p less than 0.05) and 5.5 +/- 2.5 cm H2O  (p less than 0.05) respectively. Capillary red cell velocity measured in two  patients by video television microscopy also increased during and after infusion  with prostaglandin E1. Six patients claimed subjective benefit and in three their  ulcers healed. These findings support the observed beneficial effect of  prostaglandin E1 and suggest that it improves the nutritive capillary circulation  by lowering precapillary resistance.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the development of a right ventricular (RV) outflow tract obstruction of sufficient severity to produce a  systolic murmur following blunt cardiac trauma. A nonpenetrating impact directly  on the anterior surface of the heart was produced in 34 open chest anesthetized  dogs. Impact velocity was 12 m/sec in 15 dogs and 18 m/sec in 19 dogs. Seventeen  dogs died immediately following impact. Pressures in the pulmonary artery and RV  were measured during the control period in all dogs, and intermittently for 90  minutes following impact in ten of the 17 surviving dogs. At 90 minutes following  impact a systolic pressure gradient of 9 +/- 2 mm Hg (range, 3 to 22 mm Hg)  developed across the RV outflow tract and was associated with a prominent  ejection murmur. At autopsy, RV wall thickness measured at the midventricular  level was 13.5 +/- 1 mm (mean +/- SEM) which was thicker than in dogs that died  immediately following impact, 6 +/- 1 mm (p less than 0.001). Microscopy of the  RV myocardium of dogs that survived impact showed interstitial bleeding with  prominent accumulations of blood between muscle bundles, whereas dogs that died  immediately after impact showed no interstitial bleeding. The obstruction seems  to have resulted from the increased RV wall thickness due to interstitial  bleeding. In the absence, therefore, of other evidence to explain a new systolic  murmur in patients following nonpenetrating cardiac trauma, the possibility of RV  outflow obstruction might be considered.

T2  - The American journal of pathology
AB  - Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of peripheral nerve in rats receiving 6% lead carbonate for 4-10 weeks provided evidence of a specific Schwann cell  injury, associated with demyelination. Intranuclear inclusions in Schwann cells  appeared within 2 weeks of administration of a lead-containing diet. Swelling of  Schwann cells and disintegration of their cytoplasm was evident at 4 weeks.  Distinctive electron-dense inclusions appeared in both Schwann and endothelial  cells during the period of intoxication and were ultrastructurally identical to  pathognomonic inclusions of lead poisoning seen in renal tubular epithelial  cells. Scanning microscopy (SEM) with electron-probe microanalysis was used to  identify the lead-containing deposits. In addition to Schwann cell changes,  vessels revealed endothelial cell injury and alteread permeability to  macromolecules. Since morphologic changes of Schwann cells precede the  development of altered vascular permeability and endoneurial edema, it appears  that lead gains access to the endoneurium prior to the development of altered  vascular permeability, suggesting that edema and altered endoneurial fluid  pressure are epiphenomena that supervene after demyelination occurs.  Remyelination, Schwann cell proliferation and formation of onion bulbs are  manifestations of persistent toxic injury to myelin-sustaining cells, resulting  in chronic demyelination.

AB  - Trochanteric bedsores are a serious condition because of the danger of osteoarthritis of the coxofemoral joint, which is a source of septicemia, and  also because of the difficulty of covering them with skin owing to the mobility  of the bone and the absence of skin laxity in the area. The authors suggest a new  technique of closure after local preparation providing a clean "surgical" defect.  They use a groin island flap raised in the Japanese "retrograde" manner (i.e.  laterally to medially). This technique is of course the fruit of the authors'  experience of the microsurgery. The distal portion of the flap is drawn,  corresponding to the size of the defect (round shape). The proximal portion  contains the vessels surrounded by subcutaneous and protected by a  de-epithelialized triangle of skin with a distal base. The flap is passed through  a subcutaneous tunnel between the femoral trigone and the trochanteric area to be  covered. The donor site is closed by approximation of the edges after they have  been undermined. The authors discuss the others possible surgical managements: 1)  local flaps (transposition flap, Z plasties, are unsuitable; 2) the double  S-rotation flap had the drawback of creating a large undermined area and leaving  a scar on the trochanteric region; 3) simple GER-type muscle flaps are not  advisable because the transposed muscle always indergoes a fibrous involution so  that the graft provides insufficient protection; 4) myocutaneous flaps, and  especially fascia lata myocutaneous flap, offer better indication, because of  muscle only acts as a vascular pedicle for the skin flap. The only drawback is  the relative defect resulting from raising the flap. The authors conclude that  the groin island flap offers the following advantages; a skin material which is  more than efficient; ideal vascularization; perfect corverage without undue  tension of the trochanteric surface; an interesting training for the plastic  surgeon performing microsurgical reconstruction.

AB  - To define the utility of high-dose barbiturate therapy following an episode of complete global cerebral ischemia, we investigate the effects of 60 mg/kg of  thiopental given to cats five minutes after resuscitation from 12, 14, or 16 min  of electrically induced ventricular fibrillation (VF). All aspects of the arrest,  resuscitation, with post-arrest care were carefully controlled, with the EEG  becoming isoelectric 20-25 s after the onset mean resuscitation time of 2.5 +/-  0.2 (SEM) min. For any given duration of VF, there were no differences (control  vs thiopental) in any pre- or post-arrest parameters (blood pressure, blood  gases, electrolytes, etc.) A total of 68 resuscitated cats were entered into  various treatment and control groups, and all but one group received 20-24 h of  post-resuscitation paralysis, mechanical ventilation, and ICU support before  being extubated. Cats received an additional six days of aggressive nursing care,  and daily examinations were performed with the assignment of a neurologic deficit  score (NDS) between 0 (normal) and (brain dead). Autopsies were performed to  determine the cause of death in animals which died before the end of the  seven-day observation period. The early post-arrest period was marked by the  occurrence of repetitive, rhythmic bursts of high-frequency  electroencephalographic (EEG) activity (? seizures) in 38 per cent of control  animals (16/42, all arrest times combined). Ten of these animals died as a result  of severe neurologic injuries. By contrast, only 12 per cent of treated cats  (3/26) developed similar EEG patterns (P less than 0.05) and there were no  neurologic deaths in the thiopental groups. The differences in the incidence of  neurologic deaths (control vs. thiopental) was significant (P less than 0.02).  The change in overall mortality did not quite reach significance (36 per cent vs.  21 per cent), and treatment had no effect on the incidence of deaths due to  cardiovascular causes (e.g., myocardial infarctions). In spite of the effects on  mortality, treatment had no effect on the neurologic function of survivors  (assessed by NDS). These findings suggest that thiopental improved survival rates  by suppressing an unusual post-arrest EEG pattern (? anticonvulsant effect), but  had no additional cerebral protective effects.

AB  - The beneficial effects of lodoxamide tromethamine (U42585E) have been examined in a canine model of myocardial ischemic injury. Lodoxamide was infused 20 mg/kg/h  i.v. starting 30 min before occlusion of the proximal left circumflex coronary  artery (LCX) and continuing through 90 min of ischemia. Lodoxamide produced a  significant reduction in ultimate infarct size measured at 24 h by postmortem  tetrazolium perfusion staining. Infarct size expressed as a percent of the  anatomical area at risk was 21.7 +/- 2.7 in the treated group vs. 47.0 +/- 3.1 in  the control group (mean +/- SEM). No significant difference in area at risk was  observed between treated and control groups. Salvage occurred primarily in  subepicardial and midmyocardial tissue without apparent lateral protection.  Histological examination confirmed gross results of postmortem staining. The  protection appeared to be unrelated to myocardial oxygen demand since no  hemodynamic differences between groups were observed at the time of occlusion of  throughout the 24-h experimental course. Concurrent studies of ex vivo platelet  aggregation showed no effect of lodoxamide on adenosine diphosphate (ADP),  collagen, and arachidonic acid-induced aggregation. In vivo antithrombotic  effects were evaluated in four conscious dogs by inducing LCX thrombosis with  low-amperage stimulation (50 microA for 24 h) of the intimal surface. Occlusive  thrombi occurred in all four dogs and were similar to controls. These results  suggest that lodoxamide reduces myocardial ischemic injury by a mechanism  unrelated to oxygen demand or antiplatelet effects.

AB  - We examined the physiology of continence in 12 patients at least four months after colectomy, mucosal proctectomy, and endorectal ileo-anal anastomosis for  ulcerative colitis and familial polyposis. The mean fecal output (+/-SEM) was 598  +/- 60 gm, passed as 12 +/- 4 movements/24 hr, of which 4 +/- 1 were passed at  night. The patients were generally continent during the day and could distinguish  gas from stool, but 11 of 12 leaked stools at night. Anal sphincter resting  pressures (71 +/- 8 cm H2O) and squeeze pressures (171 +/- 15 cm H2O) of patients  were similar to those of ten healthy controls (P greater than 0.05), although the  rectal inhibitory reflex was absent in the patients. After operation, the distal  bowel had a pressure-volume curve of greater slope (0.15 +/- 0.05 ml/cm H2O) than  it had in controls (0.07 +/- 0.01 ml/cm H2O, P less than 0.05) and a lesser  maximum capacity (patients, 248 +/- 31 ml; controls, 406 +/- 26 ml; P less than  0.05). The greater the capacity of the neorectum, the fewer was the number of  bowel movements/day (r = 0.91, P less than 0.001). We concluded that the  operation preserved the anal sphincter, although it decreased the capacity and  compliance of the distal bowel and impaired continence.

AB  - In order to define immediate criteria of prognosis for patients with cirrhosis, hospitalized in emergency for upper gastrointestinal tract haemorrhage, 164 cases  of haemorrhages medically treated were reviewed. A prognostic study of each  variant points to the clinical, endoscopic and biological data connected with  death. That study illustrates the prognostic value of traditional data. Patients  who died within the first 30 days had a significantly higher incidence of hepatic  encephalopathy, hematemesis, ascites, low blood pressure, bleeding oesophageal  varices during endoscopy, hypoprothrombinemia, hyperbilirubinemia. Those who  survived had a significantly higher incidence of aspirin intake, numerous  haemorrhages, good state of health, non bleeding peptic ulcer. Several series of  multivariant analysis: multiple regression and linear discrimination, differing  from one another in variates were done. They have allowed identification of 11  variables used in establishing a prognostic index. In the series studied, it  gives an 87% probability of correct differentiation. Such an index allows an  objective estimate of the value and limits of a group of patients in which the  efficiency of other treatments could be tested in controlled trials.

AB  - The luminal surface of the aorta and the carotid artery in normal and cholesterol-fed rabbits (3 weeks, 6 weeks, and 8 months of alimentary  hypercholesterolemia) was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). To study  endothelial injury the vessels were perfused and stained under physiological  pressure. The frequency of large and small endothelial defects was determined per  surface unit of endothelium in the normal and experimental groups of rabbits.  Loss of endothelial cells was regarded as a large defect, argyrophilic cells,  craters, and stomata were regarded as small ones. It was found that the  percentage of regions without endothelial cells was similar in both control  rabbits and in rabbits with experimental atherosclerosis (0.005--0.04% of the  total surface examined). The frequency of small endothelial defects increased in  rabbits after 3 weeks of hypercholesterolemia but decreased to the control level  after 6 weeks of hypercholesterolemia. In rabbits with 8 months of  hypercholesterolemia the frequency and area of defects outside plaques did not  differ from the control group. In the group with hypercholesterolemia for 8  months 39.2% of the plaque surface contained endothelial cells in which there  were no distinct silver-stained cell borders. Kevex X-ray spectrometric data of  silver topography indicated that the plaque surface without distinct cell borders  was not an area devoid of cells. The data obtained do not support the assumption  that morphological endothelial injury is the structural precursor of plaque  formation.

AU  - El-badrawi, H. H.

T2  - Contraceptive delivery systems
AB  - Endometrial samples from 64 women using different types of IUDs were used to study the ultrastructural changes of the human endometrium as influenced by  nonmedicated and copper devices, using SEM and TEM in an attempt to explain the  physiological mechanism of their actions. The absence of cytoplasmic  macro-apocrine secretory granules with copper devices and their defective  separation with nonmedicated IUDs support the theory that the IUD interferes with  the carbohydrate metabolism and secretory function of the endometrial cells. It  also indicates that IUDs may function through the interference with the  blastocyst-endometrial interaction and blastocyst survival. The change in the  intrauterine environment due to the absence of normal secretion may also affect  sperm capacitation and/or the acrosomal reaction, with subsequent failure of  fertilization. The absence of ciliated cells at the site of copper IUD contact  zone and their defective ciliation away from it in the presence of normal steroid  function may indicate an effect of the copper ions on the estrogen receptors. The  asynchronous development of the endometrium and blastocyst mechanism of IUD  function was not supported in this study. The occurrence of intermenstrual  bleeding with IUDs is governed by 2 factors: 1) the pressure exerted by the IUD  causing endothelial vascular injury and release of erythrocytes into endometrial  stroma; and 2) the increased stromal hydrostatic pressure which acts as a force  against the basal lamina and epithelial integrity. This was proven by the loss of  normal microvillous pattern of the endometrial cells even away from the copper  IUD, which support the rigidity of the cellular membranes.

AB  - We studied ischemic acute renal failure in 28 dogs by micropuncture, microsphere, morphologic, and whole kidney hemodynamic techniques, 18 to 24 hours after the  renal artery was clamped (clamping time, 60 to 90 min). Before the artery was  clamped, renal blood flow (RBF) averaged 3.49 +/- (SEM) 0.23 ml/min x g and was  not significantly different (3.70 +/- 0.34 ml/min x g) 18 hours after the  ischemic episode. RBF autoregulatory capability was, however, significantly  reduced. Fractional outer cortical blood flow decreased slightly from 41 +/- 2 to  36 +/- 3% (P less than 0.05) postischemia. Single nephron glomerular filtration  rate (SNGFR) was highly variable from one animal to the next and ranged from 0 to  87 nl/min (mean, 36 +/- [SEM] 7 nl/min) in a manner similar to whole kidney  inulin clearance, which ranged from 0 to 0.56 ml/min x g (mean, 0.30 +/- 0.05  ml+min x g). The correlation coefficient between SNGFR and inulin clearance was  highly significant, indicating an association between SNGFR and whole kidney GFR.  Proximal tubule pressure (PTP) averaged 20 +/- (SEM) 1 mm Hg. In 6 dogs, the  glomerular filtration coefficient (Kf) was determined by measurements of  stop-flow pressure, colloid osmotic pressure, SNGFR, PTP, and single nephron  filtration fraction, Kf was below that obtained for control animals. Scanning  electron microscopy (SEM) studies indicated that the endothelial fenestrations  were reduced in number and size. These studies suggest that one major  characteristic of ischemic nephropathy in the dog is a derangement in the  filtration process. The maintenance of RBF in the postischemic phase may occur by  utilization of the autoregulatory reserve of the renal vasculature.

AB  - Thirty-six dogs under chloralose anesthesia were studied in groups of six. Arterial pressure (BP), central venous pressure (CVP), intracranial pressure  (ICP), and arterial blood gases were monitored. The group underwent: 1)  anesthesia only; 2) phlebotomy (P) (40% of blood volume) and reinfusion (RI) of  half the shed blood plus Ringer's lactate solution; 3) P followed by pneumatic  trousers (PT), and then RI; 4) inflation of an epidural 2-cc Foley catheter  (EFC); 5) P followed by EFC and then RI; and 6) P followed by EFC and then by PT  and RI. Group 1 was stable. In Group 2, P lowered BP (49 torr systolic +/- 6  SEM), CVP, and ICP. RI restored these. In Group 3, the PT improved BP (P less  than .05) without increasing ICP. In Group 4, EFC increased ICP (P less than .05)  to 15 +/- 4 torr. In Groups 5 and 6, ICP was not significantly increased by EFC  or PT and RI.

AB  - The effect of somatostatin on splanchnic hemodynamics was determined in 8 patients with cirrhosis of the liver and in 18 normal subjects using  arterial-hepatic-venous catheterization. Estimated hepatic blood flow determined  by indocyanine green infusion was 1.36 +/- 0.23 L/min (+/- SEM) in patients with  cirrhosis and remained unaffected during 30 min of somatostatin (250 microgram/h)  administration. Wedged hepatic venous pressure which was elevated to 23 +/- 1.8  mmHg was also uninfluenced. In contrast to somatostatin, an infusion of  vasopressin (12 U/h for 30 min) given to the same patients, lowered estimated  blood flow by 28% (p < 0.05) and wedged hepatic venous pressure by 18% (p <  0.02). Arterial gastrin and insulin levels were lowered during somatostatin  infusion by 33% (p < 0.02) and by 75% (p < 0.005), respectively. In contrast to  the cirrhosis, infusion of 250 microgram/h somatostatin into normal subjects was  associated with a decrease of estimated hepatic blood flow from 1.20 +/- 0.16 to  0.88 +/- 0.12 L/min (p < 0.01) representing a 27% decline. Arterial gastrin and  insulin concentrations were lower (p < 0.01) than in cirrhosis, but the basal  levels were lowered by somatostatin to a similar degree in both groups of  patients. A higher dose of somatostatin (500 microgram/h) administered to normal  subjects resulted in a similar decrease of gastrin and of estimated hepatic blood  flow as that seen with 250 microgram/h, whereas a lower dose (125 microgram/h)  decreased gastrin but failed to influence estimated hepatic blood flow. Thus,  somatostatin at a dose which has been used in the treatment of acute peptic ulcer  hemorrhage (250 microgram/h) failed to influence estimated hepatic blood flow and  wegded hepatic venous pressure in patients with cirrhosis but lowered splanchnic  blood flow in normal subjects. Assuming that this effect contributes to  somatostatin's therapeutic efficacy, these results cast doubt on its potential  value in the treatment of upper gastrointestinal bleeding of cirrhotics with  portal hypertension.

AB  - Distraction is considered to be a factor in many spinal cord injuries. With a specially designed distraction apparatus and the 14C-antipyrine autoradiographic  technique, the effect of distraction on spinal cord blood flow (SCBF) in cats was  studied. Distraction was performed at L2-3 at a rate of 0.25 cm/10 min, and the  spinal evoked response (SER) was monitored by stimulating the sciatic nerve and  recording at T-13. The SCBF was assessed in five control animals, four animals in  whom the SER was markedly altered by distraction, and five animals after the SER  had been abolished and an additional 0.5 cm distraction applied. Control cats had  gray- and white-matter flows of 44.5 +/- 1.4 (SEM) and 10.5 +/- 0.4 ml/100  gm/min, respectively. Distraction to the point of marked SER alteration caused a  50% loss of SCBF at and caudal to the distraction site. An additional 0.5 cm  distraction produced total abolition of SCBF at the distraction site and for a  considerable distance rostral and caudal to it. Thus, it is shown that spinal  distraction causes cord ischemia similar to that seen with other types of spinal  cord injury. In addition, distraction severe enough to cause loss of the SER has  already produced severe cord ischemia.

AB  - We performed serial pulmonary function measurements in 28 patients with thermal injury in order to investigate the pulmonary effects of smoke inhalation, small  and large surface burns, and the combination of burn and inhalation. Patients  were studied at postinjury time intervals of 9.0 +/- 0.6 (M +/- SEM), 22.0 +/-  1.6, 37.3 +/- 2.2, 58.4 +/- 2.5 hours; 11.5 +/- 0.6 days; 1.1 +/- 0.1 and 5.0 +/-  0.5 months. Spirometry was found to be as useful as more sophisticated  measurements in the examination of both burn and smoke inhalation groups. Smoke  inhalation caused severe airway obstruction 9 h after exposure. Patients with  surface burn resuscitated with 4 ml of Ringer's lactate/per cent surface area  burn/kilogram developed a significant restrictive defect over the first 58 h,  despite normal pulmonary capillary wedge pressures. The restrictive defect in  these patients correlated with the size of surface and chest burn, degree of  fluid retention, and reduction in colloid osmotic pressure. Surface burn and  smoke inhalation caused the greatest deterioration in pulmonary function. These  defects gradually resolved during the period of observation.

AB  - "Cephalée d'effort" (Tinel C.E.) is provocated by any physical effort: taking up a heavy weight, but also coughing, sneezing, laughing, going to stool. Pain is  usually localized, abrupt in onset and of short duration. One may distinguish: 1)  C.E. secondary to intracranial lesions, cranial traumatism, tumours of posterior  fossa, syringomyelobulbia, Arnold-Chiari malformation, Paget disease, etc... 2)  Isolated or primary C.E.: they occur mainly in men after fifty. Recurrence is  capricious. Prognosis is good. Three mechanisms are possible: acute veinous  hypertension of dural sinuses; sharp C.S.F. pressure rise, dural traction. The  denomination of "céphalée d'effort" given by Tinel in 1932 is preferred to this  of cough headache given by Sir Charles Symonds in 1956; because of the  anteriority and wider conception of causal physical efforts, including cough.

The critical pressure, causing  membrane rupture was determined in anesthetized cats. Its value was found to be  in the range 10--30 mmHg (x+/-S.E.M.=23.4+/-17.1). This value was compared with  the pressure increases caused by thoracic and abdominal compression, cervical  strangulation, forced Trendelenburg position, coughing and sneezing.

T2  - The British journal of ophthalmology
AB  - Intraocular pressure was artificially raised to 60--70 mmHg in 7 albino rabbits for periods of 15 minutes to 4 hours. The corneal endothelium of these eyes was  studied by transmission and scanning electron microscopy. A correlation between  exposure time to elevated IOP, clinical signs observed by slit-lamp examination,  and extent of morphological damage is clearly shown. In eyes exposed to high  pressure for 15 and 30 minutes corneas remained transparent and only minimal  changes could be detected by SEM, which consisted of small areas of cell with  unevenness of their surface, occasional cellular ruptures, and diminution of  cilia and microvilli. After 1--2 hours of exposure small, solitary corneal  opacifications appeared. In these eyes more severe morphological changes  affecting larger areas were observed, with additional cellular blebbing,  excariocytosis, cellular rupture, disintegration, and disappearance seen in SEM.  Thin sections revealed swelling of mitochondria, disorganisation of endoplasmic  reticulum, and the existence of myelin bodies. In eyes exposed for 3 and 4 hours  to high IOP corneal haziness, implying stromal oedema, appeared. In these eyes  the areas affected were larger, the extent of damage being more severe. Many  areas were bare of endothelium, surrounded by scattered cellular debris, and  showed cells with ballooning surfaces and multiple ruptures. Even in severe  cellular damage cellular junctions appeared intact. It is assumed that  endothelial cells are more sensitive to IOP elevation than the cellular junctions  and that injury to the active pump system due to morphological damage is  responsible for the resultant corneal oedema.

AB  - To characterize the role of the liver and kidney in the metabolic response to injury and infection, selective catheterization of the hepatic (42 veins) and  renal veins (21 veins) was performed in 31 burn patients (mean burn size: 51%  TBS), studied 4-129 days postinjury. Blood flow was determined by standard  clearance techniques (ICG and PAH), and simultaneous arterial and hepatic and/or  renal vein blood was obtained for oxygen, glucose, lactate, pyruvate, and amino  acids. Patients studied in the first to third weeks postinjury were classified as  noninfected (8 studies), bacteremic (8 studies), or bacteremic with complications  (5 studies). There was no difference in age, weight, mean burn size, pulse rate,  blood pressure, rectal temperature, total body oxygen consumption, or cardiac  index among these groups. Estimated hepatic blood flow (EHBF) and hepatic  substrate balance of these patients were compared with postabsorptive normal  subjects in the literature (mean +/- SEM or range). :Formula: (See Text) Thermal  injury alone resulted in marked increases in EHBF, hepatic oxygen uptake, and  glucogenesis. The added insult of bacteremia significantly increased hepatic  glucose output; as clinical sepsis progressed, glucose output decreased sharply.  The kidney consistently demonstrated a net uptake of glucose in all studies. The  changes in hepatic glucose output in bacteremic patients occurred without  significant differences in EHBF, oxygen utilization or lactate uptake, but were  associated with marked alterations in amino acid uptake.

T2  - Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)
AB  - A combined transmission (TEM) and scanning (SEM) electron microscopic study was performed on aortae of deoxycorticosterone-salt (DOC-salt)-treated rats and  spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) to compare the effects of hypertension as  well as its reversal on the aortic intima. To best reproduce the in vivo state of  the vasculature, rats were perfusion-fixed at pressures corrected for each  individual animal (30 mm Hg below measured systolic pressure). The intimal  alterations were focal and thus were best appreciated with the combined use of  SEM and TEM. Qualitatively, both models of hypertension showed similar intimal  changes, which consisted of subintimal thickening due to an accumulation of both  extracellular material and cells. Subendothelial cells with a morphology  indicating a blood-borne origin were present simultaneously with cells derived  from the vessel wall. The increased subendothelial extracellular material  included precipitated plasma proteins, reticulated basement membrane, collagen  fibers, and fragments of elastin. Increase in the height of endothelial cells  with distortion of nuclear shape was prominent. Withdrawal of DOC-salt combined  with low-salt diet for 11 weeks did not result in a discernible regression of  these intimal changes despite normalization of blood pressure. We conclude that  vascular injury, once induced, may be difficult to reverse and suggest that areas  of prior damage may serve as foci for later vascular complications.

T2  - Scanning electron microscopy
AB  - Previous investigators have examined the luninal surfaces of perfusion fixed rabbit aortas and reported endothelial damage about aortic ostial flow dividers.  These changes have been considered to represent in vivo endothelial injury  predisposing to atherosclerosis at these sites. Although standard pressure  perfusion fixation techniques were used by these investigators, the fixed aortas  were usually cut, bent open and pinned to flat surfaces before viewing. Such  procedures distort the aortic media and could result in artifactual endothelial  disruptions. We therefore studied the effect of post-fixation aortic manipulation  on luminal surface morphology about aortic ostia. Rabbit aortas were fixed by  perfusion in situ, while intra-aortic pressure was continuously monitored. When  the aortas were opened by means of two parallel, lateral, longitudinal cuts, so  that bending and pinning was avoided and normal vessel curvature was maintained,  no endothelial disruption occurred about aortic ostia. When aortas were opened  with one cut, bent open and pinned flat, ostial flow dividers were somewhat  stretched and elongated and there was endothelial disruption in the form of  spindle cell formation at the center portion of the flow dividers. Endothelial  deformation due to bending during pinning probably occurs preferentially at the  flow dividers because the media is thickest at this point. The greater  deformability at the adjacent media and differences in compliance between media  and intima results in stretching, bending and plication of the intima over the  projecting flow divider. Studies attempting to relate endothelial changes to  differences in shearing stress about ostia must take into account deformations  introduced by post-fixation manipulation.

AB  - Three years following an irradiation by the Betatron's electron beam of an epithelioma in left parieto occipital area of the scalp in a female patient aged  77, early suffering from high blood pressure, a fatal pseudo-tumoral brain  necrosis occurs presenting as a rapidly increasing from of Wernicke's aphasia.  The necropsy shows intense radionecrosis lesions of the brain and the bone, free  of any parenchymatous malignant proliferation note-worthy for the striking  density of microvascular changes as previously described in radiation therapy.  The case observed some years ago, allows to definite again the limits doses of  the extracranial irradiations now estimated at 1760 rets. That is the "Nominal  Standard Dose" (NSD) measured by rets and taking into account the number of  seances (N) and the duration of irradiation (T) which would be to take the place  of "the total dose" (D) (rads). These dosimetric criteria themselves must be  adjusted to the age and the vascular features of each patient.

AB  - Non cardiogenic pulmonary edema is caused by an increase of alveolocapillary permeability, due to different etiologies: fat embolism, multiple trauma, septic  shock, influenza pneumonia, aspiration syndrome... Chest radiographs exhibit  interstitial and/or alveolar pattern, severity of injury is assessed by the  magnitude of intra-pulmonary shunting. Pulmonary wedge pressure is normal, and  increased pulmonary vascular resistance is sometimes evidence in prolonged  evolutions, especially in fatal cases. Treatment consists in the suppression of  hypervolemia, and ventilation with positive and expiratory pressure (PEEP).  Extra-corporeal membrane lung oxygenation remains since now rather unsuccessful.

T2  - Scandinavian journal of clinical and laboratory investigation
AB  - The effects of thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) on myocardial performance and metabolism and on the severity of an acute myocardial ischaemia, were studied in  eight anesthetized open-chest dogs. TEA reduced mean arterial blood pressure (AP)  by 26%, heart rate (HR) by 20%, left ventricular dP/dt by 37%, and myocardial  oxygen consumption by 27%. Although arterial concentrations of free fatty acids,  glucose and lactate were unchanged, their myocardial uptake was reduced in  proportion to the reduction in mechanical activity of the heart. Acute ischaemic  injury was estimated from epicardial ECG recordings 10 min after occlusion of a  branch of the left anterior descending coronary artery. In seven of eight dogs  TEA caused a substantial reduction in the severity of the acute myocardial  ischaemic injury. In the eight dogs investigated, the sum of ST segment  elevations in epicardial ECG recordings was reduced from 34.0 +/- 3.4 to 23.3 +/-  2.8 mV (mean +/- SEM, P less than 0.01). After restoration of AP and HR to  control values with phenylephrine and atrial pacing, the favourable effect of TEA  on myocardial ischaemic injury was abolished. It is concluded that TEA effected a  reduction in the severity of myocardial ischaemia in open-chest dogs, mainly  through reduction of myocardial mechanical activity with consequent reduction of  myocardial metabolism.

AB  - The pressures in the lower oesophageal sphincter (high pressure zone or HPZ) and stomach were measured in 15 patients with duodenal ulcer and 14 patients with no  gastrointestinal disease. All the patients were premedicated with morphine 10 mg  i.m. In the patients without duodenal ulcer, the pressure gradient between HPZ  and stomach was 6.6 +/- 0.62 mm Hg (mean +/- SEM) before diminishing to 4.9 +/-  0.86 after induction of anaesthesia with thiopentone. During fasciculations  following i.v. suxamethonium, the gradient increased to 7.1 +/- 1.0 mm Hg. In  patients with duodenal ulcer, although the absolute pressures were less, the  gradients during the study were similar to those in healthy patients. We conclude  that there is no increased risk of regurgitation during fasciculations induced by  suxamethonium.

AB  - Five young male New Zealand White rabbits were fed a semi-synthetic diet containing 0.2% cholesterol for 2 weeks and a control group of 5 animals was fed  a normal stock diet. All animals were then injected intravenously with a single  dose of endotoxin from Serratia marcescens (200 microgram/kg body weight) and  continued on their respective diets for a further 4 weeks. The aortas were then  stained with silver nitrate and fixed under pressure for Scanning Electron  Microscopy (SEM). Argyrophilic endothelial cells were present in both groups of  animals 4 weeks after endotoxin injections. In the cholesterol-fed animals,  however, these cells were often covered with pits and craters. These findings  suggest that the hypercholesterolaemia may affect the regeneration of arterial  endothelial cells.

T2  - Annals of surgery
AB  - Surgical therapy for reflux esophagitis remains controversial. Sixty-five patients who underwent posterior gastropexy between November, 1970 and February,  1976 are presented. Indications for surgery were: esophagitis, 43 patients;  esophagitis with stricture, 12 patients; paraesophageal hernia seven patients;  incapacitating postfundoplication syndrome, three patients. The average follow-up  was 15.6 months. Eighty-two per cent of the patients had a good to excellent  result. Twenty-three per cent of the patients developed radiographically  recurrent hiatus hernia; however, the incidence of recurrent esophagitis was only  nine per cent. Two patients developed postoperative strictures (one de novo, one  recurrent). Two patients ultimately required a fundoplication for control of  their esophagitis; one patient required a Thal-Nissen procedure. Lower esophageal  sphincter pressure on patients with satisfactory results increased from 6.3 +/-  1.3 cm H2O SEM preoperatively, to 17.4 +/- 3.0 cm H2O SEM postoperatively. This  increase achieved a statistical significance of p less than 0.001. In patients  who had an unsatisfactory result, postoperative sphincter pressures were  unchanged from preoperative values. All unsatisfactory results were obtained in  patients with complicated esophagitis, i.e., Barrett's ulcer or stricture,  alkaline esophagitis, or previous hiatal surgery. Posterior gastropexy appears to  constitute effective therapy in the treatment of uncomplicated reflux esophagitis  and paraesophageal hiatus hernia without the distressing morbidity associated  with the postfundoplication syndrome.

T2  - The American journal of anatomy
AB  - Following artificial ulceration of the guinea pig bladder epithelium, study by light microscopy showed that mitotic activity occurs within 24 hours in the basal  layer of the remaining epithelium; which leads to thickening, disorganization and  cell shedding. At the ulcer margin, the epithelium forms a rolled edge, from the  extremity of which a two-layered sheet of flat cells grows over the edematous  ulcer bed, and the ulcer site is protected during dilation of the bladder by  localized muscle spasm. Healing is effected within about one week, as the mitotic  activity declines. Organization of the new epithelium commences at the periphery  and the cells acquire glycogen and alkaline phosphatase. Study by SEM, which  included normal bladders, confirmed that new epithelium spreads from a rolled  epithelial edge, and also showed that cells undergoing rejection have globular  profiles with surface microvilli. The immature epithelial cells are markedly  distorted from mutual pressure during migration and their surfaces show only  short microvilli. Ulcers heal after four to seven days, depending on size, and  the new cells rapidly assume the pentagonal and hexagonal outlines and the  reticular pattern of surface ridges, characteristic of mature surface cells. The  ridges apparently develop by fusion of rows of microvilli. By the tenth day it is  difficult to identify the original ulcer site.

AB  - The concept of acute renal failure with anuria due to malignant nephro-angiosclerosis, is uncommon. We report two cases and compare them with  others in the world literature. Knowledge of this disease entity is of triple  interest: In diagnosis and classification in the field of acute vascular  nephropathy with anuria. We cannot emphasise too much the interest of early renal  biopsy after correction of abnormal blood pressure. In physiopathology, these  malignant nephro-angioscleroses give rise to hypertension of pressor type with  high renin levels. Finally therapeutic, for there exist drugs adapted to this  type of hypertension. The association of acute renal failure and malignant  nephro-angiosclerosis should be treated as an emergency, to avoid the passage to  terminal and irreversible renal failure.

AU  - Reidy, M. A.

T2  - Atherosclerosis
AB  - A single injection of endotoxin P45 Poly Serratia marcescens was used to induce endothelial injury in rabbits. The aortic endothelium was examined by Scanning  Electron Microscopy (SEM), at various times after administration of endotoxin,  using the technique of silver staining and pressure fixation. Within one hour  after injection, some endothelial cells were curled-up and spindle-shaped in  appearance. Areas of aorta devoid of endothelial cover were occasionally observed  and platelets were sometimes found adhering to these sites. Two and four weeks  after initial injury no spindle-shaped cells were found. Instead, some  endothelial cells were heavily stained with silver. Small denuded zones were  still found and these were surrounded by brightly silver-stained cells. This  study confirms that endotoxin rapidly causes endothelial injury and suggests that  regenerating endothelial cells which were formed following injury are avidly  stained by silver salts and appear as bright cells by SEM.

AB  - The endothelial surface around branches of the normal rabbit aorta was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Focal endothelial damage was consistently  found both on, and distal to, aortic flow dividers. In some case small areas were  denuded of endothelial cover. Similar injury to endothelal cells was also  occasionally observed proximal to the ostium of a branch. Haemodynamic forces,  expecially high shear stress, may be responsible for these morphological changes.  This altered endothelial integrity probably underlies the susceptibility of these  sites to the formation of induced atherosclerotic lesions.

TI  - The trachea and cuff-induced tracheal injury. An experimental study on causative factors and prevention.
AU  - Nordin, U.
T2  - Acta oto-laryngologica. Supplementum
AB  - The effect of a large tracheal tube cuff on the rabbit tracheal mucosa was investigated by phase contrast microscopy and scanning (SEM) and transmission  (TEM) electron microscopy. The tube was left in the trachea for 15 min. The cuff  was either uninflated or inflated to a cuff-to-tracheal wall pressure (C-T  pressure) of up to 100 mmHg. The uninflated cuff caused superficial damage to the  epithelial lamina over regions where a cartilage was situated. When the cuff was  inflated, it resulted in an increase of the mucosal damage, the extent of which  was directly related to the pressure in the cuff. This took the form of both  widening of the injured areas and penetration of the damage to deeper regions. At  a C-T pressure of 100 mmHg the damage involved almost the entire mucosa and only  small unaffected mucosal regions remained. At this stage it appeared as if the  basement membrane had also begun to disintegrate. It is well known that a small  cuff easily causes deep ulceration in the mucosa overlying the cartilages. From  this investigation it was concluded that a large cuff causes the same type of  ulceration if 1) the cuff wall is not sufficiently thin and pliable, and 2) if  the cuff is overinflated enough to dilate the trachea to a diameter exceeding the  cuff-diameter. At that moment there will be circumferential tension in the cuff  and the sealing physics of the large cuff will become the sealing physics of a  small (high pressure) cuff. A large cuff, properly handled, is more benign to the  trachea than a small cuff. In order to avoid overinflation of the large cuff, the  intracuff pressure (= C-T pressure) should always be measured by means of a  four-way stopcock and an aneroid manometer. In the case of extended periods of  mechanical ventilation with a high airway pressure, the resulting tracheal  diameter at the cuff site should be checked radiographically.

Chronic ischemia caused by an increase in intraluminal pressure above the  neoplastic stenosis seems to be the main etiological factor.

AB  - To determine whether the increased filtration of serum proteins after glomerular injury is the consequence of altered electrostatic properties of the glomerular  capillary wall, we measured fractional clearances of the anionic polymer, dextran  sulfate, in nine Munich-Wistar rats in the early autologous phase of nephrotoxic  serum nephritis (NSN). In agreement with previous studied from this laboratory,  whole kidney and single nephron glomerular filtration rates were normal in NSN  rats despite histological evidence of glomerular injury, and despite a marked  reduction in the glomerular capillary ultrafiltration coefficient to  approximately one-third of normal. In the companion study (9), it was shown that  in NSN rats the mean fractional clearances of neutral dextrans over the range of  effective molecular radii from 18 to 42 A were reduced, compared to normla. In  contrast, in the present study the mean fractional clearances for dextran sulfate  over the same range of molecular radii were significantly greater than those  found previously for normal Munich-Wistar rats. The fractional clearance of  dextran sulfate molecules of the same molecular radius as serum albumin  (approximately 36 A) was increased markedly, from 0.015 +/- 0.005 (SEM) in  nonnephritic controls to 0.24 +/- 0.03 in NSN (P less than 0.001). The  sialoprotein content of glomeruli, estimated by the colloidal iron reaction, was  reduced in NSN rats as compared to normal controls. It is concluded that the  abnormal filtration of anionic serum proteins, such as albumin, seen in  glomerulopathies is, at least in part, the consequence of loss of fixed negative  charges from the glomerular capillary wall.

AB  - The effect of p-chlorophenoxyisobutyrate (CPIB) on ST-segment elevation in epicardial electrocardiographic recordings was studied during coronary artery  occlusion in dogs. Occlusion alone raised the sum of ST-segment elevations  (sigmaST) to 26 +/- 6 mV (mean +/- SEM). Intravenous (i.v.) administration of  CPIB 30 min before re-occlusion reduced sigmaST to 14 +/- 3 mV (P less than  0.03). A continuous i.v. infusion of isoproterenol increased sigmaST to 74 +/- 11  mV. Pretreatment with CPIB reduced sigmaST during isoproterenol infusion to 40  +/- 7 mV (P less than 0.005). CPIB had no effect on mean aortic blood pressure,  heart rate, or regional myocardial blood flow, as measured by radioactive  microspheres. Arterial free fatty acid (FFA) concentrations were reduced by CPIB  from 466 +/- 41 to 221 +/- 44 muEq/L (P less than 0.001) in the basal state, and  from 1966 +/- 183 to 1429 +/- 209 muEq/L (P less than 0.001) during isoproterenol  infusion. The reduction in arterial FFA concentration was associated with a  proportionate decrease in the myocardial extraction of FFA. Similar changes were  observed when CPIB was administered during an occlusion which had been  established 10 min earlier. These observations support other evidence that the  severity of acute myocardial ischemic injury in dogs is positively correlated  with the myocardial extraction of FFA, and that the severity of the ischemic  injury can be reduced by effective antilipolytic therapy.

AB  - The effects of microvascular clamps on the femoral vessels of rats were studied, using the SEM. The early changes observed were (1) local fusiform dilatation of  the area secondary to necrosis of the muscular wall, (2) flattening of the  longitudinal ridges in the endothelial (3) loss of laminar flow, (4) endothelial  sloughing, (5) platelet aggregation, and (6) leukocyte adherence and diapedesis.  The repair of the endothelium occurred by an early replication of the adjacent  undamaged endothelial cells -- with their subsequent migration across a platelet  bed. The coverage was complete in one week, although reorientation of the  neo-endothelial cells took longer. On the basis of this study and our clinical  experience, we think the ideal microvascular clamp would possess the following  characteristics: small size, light weight, mechanical simplicity, flat jaws (one  to two mm in diameter) coated with a non-slip surface, and calibrated to produce  a pressure less than 30 gm per mm2. In addition the clamp should be unaffected by  blood, autoclaving, or repeated use. No such clamp is commercially available now,  but we hope that one will be available in the near future.

AU  - Cohen, S.

T2  - The New England journal of medicine
AB  - Caffeine stimulates gastric acid secretion and reduces the competence of the lower esophageal sphincter in man. These effects of caffeine have been used as  evidence that regular coffee should not be used by patients with peptic-ulcer  disease or gastroesophageal reflux. We compared the dose-response relations of  caffeine, regular coffee and decaffeinated coffee for gastric acid secretion and  sphincter pressure in normal subjects. Decaffeinated coffee gave a maximal acid  response of 16.5 +/- 2.6 mEq per hour (mean +/- S.E.M.), which was similar to  that of regular coffee, 20.9 +/- 3.6 mEq per hour, both values being higher than  that of caffeine, 8.4 +/- 1.3, on a cup-equivalent basis. Sphincter pressure  showed minimal changes in response to caffeine, but was significantly increased  by both regular and decaffeinated coffee (P less than 0.05). These data suggest  that clinical recommendations based upon the known gastrointestinal effects of  caffeine may bear little relation to the actual observed actions of coffee or  decaffeinated coffee.

AB  - This study was carried out in order to determine the effects of the inspiration of O2-enriched air on the size of myocardial infarction. In 15 anesthetized dogs,  epicardial electrograms were recorded from 10 to 14 sites on the anterior surface  of the left ventricle before and after intermittent occlusion of the left  anterior descending coronary artery or one of its major branches. In each dog,  one occlusion was carried out while the fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) was  0.20 and the other while the FIO2 was 0.40. With an FIO2 of 0.20 the average  ST-segment elevation (ST) was 4.0 +/- 0.6 mV (SEM) and the number of sites  exhibiting ST-segment elevations exceeding 2 mV (NST) 15 minutes following  occlusion was 6.2 +/- 0.7 sites; comparable values following occlusion with an  FIO2 of 0.40 were 1.8 +/- 0.4 mV (P less than 0.01) and 2.7 +/- 0.7 sites (P less  than 0;01), reflecting reduction in acute myocardial ischemic injury; An FIO2 of  1.0 did not decrease myocardial injury further. In 24 other dogs, occlusion was  maintained for 24 hours. In nine dogs in which FIO2 was increased from 0.20 to  0.40 30 minutes after occlusion, myocardial creatine phosphokinase activity (CPK)  was less depressed in sites having comparable levels of ST-segment elevation at  15 minutes than in dogs that respired an FIO2 of 0.20 during the entire 24 hours.  All (54) sites with ST-segment elevations greater than 3 mV in the 0.20 FIO2  group showed early signs of myocardial infarction, while only 49% of such  specimens showed infarction in the 0.40 FIO2 group. Thus it is concluded that  0.40 FIO2 following an experimental coronary artery occusion decreases acute  ischemic injury and reduces the eventual development of necrosis, as evaluated by  enzymatic and histological techniques.

AB  - Gastric mucosal changes in 8 piglets subjected to a transient hypovolaemic shock were studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The mucosal lesions during  the shock were characterized by progressive degenerative changes in the mucous  membrane of the stomach. These surface changes included flattening or swelling of  the individual cells. The flattening of the mucous membrane was later connected  with red cell diapedesis through it. These changes were most typical in the areas  of haemorrhagic gastritis and preceded the ulcer formation. Following  retransfusion, the affected epithelial lining appeared greatly distended over the  oedematous lamina propria, with almost complete loss of structural detail. Masses  of red blood cells were seen to emerge through the epithelium as an indication of  subepithelial haemorrhage. It is possible that the injured epithelium is actually  broken down by the pressure of the underlying mucosal haemorrhage and oedema. At  later stages, the ulcerated areas showed complete loss of epithelial cells and  thus the underlying structureless lamina propria, covered by necrotic cell  remnants, blood cells and fibrin, was denuded.

AU  - Kjekshus, J. K.
AU  - Mjos, O. D.
T2  - The Journal of clinical investigation
AB  - Recent studies have demonstrated a depressant effect of increased delivery of FFA to the hypoxic heart. Because catecholamines are released in acute myocardial  infarction, it is likely that lipolytic activity is increased. The purpose of  this study was to determine whether inhibition of hormone-sensitive lipases  influence the extent and severity of myocardial ischemic injury produced by  coronary occlusion. Myocardial infarction was produced by occlusion of the left  anterior descending coronary artery in open-chest dogs. 15 min later a surface  map of S-T segments was obtained with the use of 10-14 epicardial leads in the  distribution area of the occluded artery. Average S-T segment elevation of all  sites was used as an index of myocardial ischemic injury. Before coronary  occlusion, the average S-T segment elevation was 0.3+/-0.2, which increased to  4.1+/-0.7 mV (SEM, 12 dogs) after occlusion. Inhibition of lipolytic activity by  beta-pyridyl-carbinol before repeated coronary occlusion reduced the  occlusion-induced S-T segment elevation to 2.1+/-0.6 mV (P < 0.001). When  arterial concentrations of FFA were raised by i.v. infusion of a triglyceride  emulsion and heparin, average S-T segment elevation after coronary occlusion  increased from 1.2+/-0.7 to 2.2+/-0.8 mV (P < 0.05) in animals treated with  beta-pyridyl-carbinol, which suggests an unfavorable effect of circulating FFA in  this setting. Isoproterenol given before a repeated occlusion increased the  severity and extent of the ischemic injury. The effect of isoproterenol on the  occlusion-induced S-T segment elevation was reduced, however, when the lipolytic  effect of the drug was inhibited by beta-pyridyl-carbinol. Our study suggests  that beta-pyridyl-carbinol during acute coronary artery occlusion may be of  importance in reducing the extent and severity of myocardial ischemic injury.

T2  - Journal of wound care
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The presence of sub-epidermal moisture (SEM) over a bony prominence is indicative of incipient pressure ulcer (pressure injury/decubitus/bedsore) (PU).  Early identification of patients at increased risk of PU can prompt interventions  that reduce the incidence and severity of hospital (or community)-acquired PUs  (HAPUs). This study evaluated the clinical utility of a SEM Scanner device in  HAPU management. METHOD: The study used a pragmatic 'real-world' approach. HAPU  data before and during SEM Scanner use were obtained through routine audit.  Patients had regular visual and daily SEM Scanner skin assessments over the  sacrum and heels. Nursing care otherwise followed standard of care according to  the established protocols of individual participating sites. HAPU incidence rates  were determined and feedback gathered from health professionals on how the device  influenced HAPU-related clinical decision-making. RESULTS: There were 15  participating sites: 13 acute care, one palliative care and one community care  setting. The sample size was 1478 patients. All sites reported a substantial  reduction in mean HAPU incidence: 87.2% in acute care settings; 46.7% in the  palliative care setting and 26.7% in the community care setting. A 100% incidence  reduction was reported in 10 (66.7%) sites. In the palliative care setting, SEM  Scanner results changed HAPU-related clinical decision-making for 40% of patients  scanned. The community care site demonstrated a 82% change in clinical  decision-making. CONCLUSION: In this study, SEM analysis fitted seamlessly into  routine skin assessment and enabled early identification of increased risk of  tissue damage, with clinically important reductions in the incidence of HAPU  across all participating sites.
