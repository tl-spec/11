AB  - Remdesivir has been widely used for the treatment of Coronavirus (COVID) in hospitalized patients, but its nephrotoxicity is still under investigation(1).  Given the paucity of knowledge regarding the mechanism and optimal treatment of  the development of acute kidney injury (AKI) in the setting of COVID, we analyzed  the role of remdesivir and built multifactorial causal models of COVID-AKI by  applying causal discovery machine learning techniques. Risk factors of COVID-AKI  and renal function measures were represented in a temporal sequence using  longitudinal data from EHR. Our models successfully recreated known causal  pathways to changes in renal function and interactions with each other and  examined the consistency of high-level causal relationships over a 4-day course  of remdesivir. Results indicated a need for assessment of renal function on day 2  and 3 use of remdesivir, while uncovering that remdesivir may pose less risk to  AKI than existing conditions of chronic kidney disease.

AB  - We aimed to describe practice patterns and outcomes in patients with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support throughout the coronavirus  2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, with the hypothesis that mortality would improve as we  accumulated knowledge and experience. We included 48 patients supported on  veno-venous ECMO (VV-ECMO) at a single institution between April 2020 and  December 2021. Patients were categorized into three waves based on cannulation  date, corresponding to the wild-type (wave 1), alpha (wave 2), and delta (wave 3)  variants. One hundred percent of patients in waves 2 and 3 received  glucocorticoids, compared with 29% in wave 1 ( p < 0.01), and the majority  received remdesivir (84% and 92% in waves 2 and 3, vs . 35% in wave 1; p < 0.01).  Duration of pre-ECMO noninvasive ventilation was longer in waves 2 and 3 (mean  8.8 days and 3.9 days, vs . 0.7 days in wave 1; p < 0.01), as was time to  cannulation (mean 17.2 and 14.6 days vs . 8.8 days in wave 1; p < 0.01) and ECMO  duration (mean 55.7 days and 43.0 days vs . 28.4 days in wave 1; p = 0.02).  Mortality in wave 1 was 35%, compared with 63% and 75% in waves 2 and 3 ( p =  0.05). These results suggest an increased prevalence of medically refractory  disease and rising mortality in later variants of COVID-19.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Demonstrated health inequalities persist in the United States. SARS-CoV-2 (COVID) has been no exception, with access to treatment and  hospitalization differing across race or ethnic groups. Here, we aim to assess  differences in treatment with remdesivir and hospital length of stay across the  four waves of the pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a subset of the Truveta  data, we examine the odds ratio (OR) of in-hospital remdesivir treatment and risk  ratio (RR) of in-hospital length of stay between Black or African American  (Black) to White patients. We adjusted for confounding factors, such as age, sex,  and comorbidity status. RESULTS: There were statistically significant lower rates  of remdesivir treatment and longer in-hospital length of stay comparing Black  patients to White patients early in the pandemic (OR for treatment: 0.88, 95%  confidence interval [CI]: 0.80, 0.96; RR for length of stay: 1.17, CI: 1.06,  1.21). Rates became close to parity between groups as the pandemic progressed.  CONCLUSION: While inpatient remdesivir treatment rates increased and length of  stay decreased over the beginning course of the pandemic, there are still  inequalities in patient care.

AB  - Remdesivir (RDV) is the only antiviral drug approved for COVID-19 therapy by the FDA. Another drug LAGEVRIO™ (molnupiravir) though has not been approved yet by  FDA but has been authorized on December 23, 2021, for emergency use to treat  adults with mild-to moderate COVID-19 symptoms and for whom alternative COVID-19  treatment options are not clinically appropriate. The fact is that the efficacy  of RDV is, however, limited in vivo though it is highly promising in vitro  against SARS-CoV-2 virus. In this paper we are focusing on the action mechanism  of RDV and how it can be improved in vivo. The stability of RDV alone and on  encapsulation with our platform technology based polymer NV-387 (NV-CoV-2), were  compared in presence of plasma in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, a non-clinical  pharmacology study of NV-CoV-2 (Polymer) and NV CoV-2 (Polymer encapsulated  Remdesivir) in both NL-63 infected and uninfected rats was done. In addition, the  antiviral activity of NV-CoV-2 and NV-CoV-2-R was compared with RDV in a cell  culture study. The results are (i) NV-CoV-2 polymer encapsulation protects RDV  from plasma-mediated catabolism in both in vitro and in vivo, studies; (ii) Body  weight measurements of the normal (uninfected) rats after administration of the  test materials (NV-CoV-2 and NV-CoV-2-R) showed no toxic effects. (iii) Body  weight measurements and survival rates of the NL-63 infected rats were similar to  the uninfected rats after treatment with NV-CoV-2 and NV-CoV-2-R. Overall, the  efficacy as an antiviral regimens were found in this order as below; NV-CoV-2-R >  NV-CoV-2 > RDV. Our platform technology based NV-387-encapsulated-RDV  (NV-CoV-2-R) drug has a dual effect against different variants of the  coronaviruses. First, NV-CoV-2 is an antiviral regimen. Secondly, RDV is  protected from plasma-mediated degradation in transit. All together, NV-CoV-2-R  is the safest and efficient regimen against COVID-19.

AB  - GS-441524, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitor, is a 1'-CN-substituted adenine C-nucleoside analog with broad-spectrum antiviral  activity. However, the low oral bioavailability of GS-441524 poses a challenge to  its anti-SARS-CoV-2 efficacy. Remdesivir, the intravenously administered version  (version 1.0) of GS-441524, is the first FDA-approved agent for SARS-CoV-2  treatment. However, clinical trials have presented conflicting evidence on the  value of remdesivir in COVID-19. Therefore, oral GS-441524 derivatives (VV116,  ATV006, and GS-621763; version 2.0, targeting highly conserved viral RdRp) could  be considered as game-changers in treating COVID-19 because oral administration  has the potential to maximize clinical benefits, including decreased duration of  COVID-19 and reduced post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as  limited side effects such as hepatic accumulation. This review summarizes the  current research related to the oral derivatives of GS-441524, and provides  important insights into the potential factors underlying the controversial  observations regarding the clinical efficacy of remdesivir; overall, it offers an  effective launching pad for developing an oral version of GS-441524.

AB  - Despite several reports and small case series on the disease course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with inborn errors of immunity (IEI), including X-linked  agammaglobulinemia (XLA), this topic remains incompletely described. Here we  present the case of a 38-year-old unvaccinated man with XLA, who acquired  SARS-CoV-2 infection and experienced a protracted disease course with 47 days of  SARS-CoV-2 positivity, critical COVID-19 with respiratory insufficiency  necessitating intensive care and ventilatory support, and prompting repeated  intensified treatments with remdesivir, dexamethasone, and monoclonal antibodies  to eventually control infection. We describe the disease course and treatment and  review the current literature on COVID-19 susceptibility and evidence for vaccine  efficacy in patients with XLA.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This work presents a novel computational multi-reference poly-conformational algorithm for design, optimization, and repositioning of  pharmaceutical compounds. METHODS: The algorithm searches for candidates by  comparing similarities between conformers of the same compound and identifies  target compounds, whose conformers are collectively close to the conformers of  each compound in the reference set. Reference compounds may possess highly  variable MoAs, which directly, and simultaneously, shape the properties of target  candidate compounds. RESULTS: The algorithm functionality has been case study  validated in silico, by scoring ChEMBL drugs against FDA-approved reference  compounds that either have the highest predicted binding affinity to our chosen  SARS-CoV-2 targets or are confirmed to be inhibiting such targets in-vivo. All  our top scoring ChEMBL compounds also turned out to be either high-affinity  ligands to the chosen targets (as confirmed in separate studies) or show  significant efficacy, in-vivo, against those selected targets. In addition to  method case study validation, in silico search for new compounds within two  virtual libraries from the Enamine database is presented. The library's virtual  compounds have been compared to the same set of reference drugs that we used for  case study validation: Olaparib, Tadalafil, Ergotamine and Remdesivir. The large  reference set of four potential SARS-CoV-2 compounds has been selected, since no  drug has been identified to be 100% effective against the virus so far, possibly  because each candidate drug was targeting only one, particular MoA. The goal here  was to introduce a new methodology for identifying potential candidate(s) that  cover multiple MoA-s presented within a set of reference compounds.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The emergence of COVID-19 overwhelmed tuberculosis (TB) prevention and control, resulting in a decrease in TB detection rate and an increase in TB  deaths. Furthermore, the temporary immunosuppressive effects, lung inflammation,  and the corticosteroids used to treat COVID-19, may play a direct role in  immunosuppression, leading to reactivation of either previous infection or latent  TB or the development of new TB. Thus, the aim of this study was to review TB  incidence in individuals who recovered from COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a  systematic search of available databases for previously published studies that  reported TB in COVID-19 survivors. The PRISMA checklist was used to guide the  review, and the JBI checklist was used to evaluate the study's quality. The  descriptive data were summarized. RESULTS: Data were extracted from 21 studies  conducted in 13 countries having 33 cases. The median age was 44 years (range;  13.5-80), and more than half (18, 54.5%) were males. Twelve patients immigrated  from TB endemic settings. All 17 patients assessed for HIV were seronegative, and  all 11 patients assessed for BCG vaccination status were vaccinated. The majority  (20, 69%) of patients had some type of comorbidity with diabetes (12/29) and  hypertension (9/29) being the most common. Four patients (30.77%) had a history  of TB. Corticosteroids were used to treat COVID-19 in 62.5% (10) of individuals.  Dexamethasone, remdesivir, azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, and enoxaparin were  the most commonly used drugs to treat COVID-19. The most common TB symptoms were  fever, cough, weight loss, dyspnea, and fatigue. Twenty, eleven, and two patients  developed pulmonary, extrapulmonary, and disseminated/miliary TB respectively. It  may take up to seven months after COVID-19 recovery to develop tuberculosis. Data  on the final treatment outcome was found for 24 patients, and five patients died  during the anti-TB treatment period. CONCLUSION: Tuberculosis after recovering  from COVID-19 is becoming more common, potentially leading to a TB outbreak in  the post-COVID-19 era. The immunosuppressive nature of the disease and its  treatment modalities may contribute to post COVID-19 TB. Thus, we recommend a  further study with a large sample size. Furthermore, we recommend feasibility  studies to assess and treat latent TB in COVID-19 patients residing in TB endemic  counties since treatment of latent TB is done only in TB non-endemic countries.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Since the late COVID-19, many countries have faced various surges and peaks within the number of infected. Iran was one of the countries that faced  many surges and peaks within these years and faced many inadequacies and  shortages of resources and hospital beds. Hence the healthcare system started  using in-hospital medication such as Remdesivir in outpatients to reduce the load  of patients admitted to the hospital. This study aimed to evaluate and compare  the reported signs, symptoms, and outcomes of COVID-infected hospitalized and  out-patients receiving Remdesivir. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study,  214 patients (121 outpatient and 93 hospitalized) with moderate levels of Covid  infection between October 2021 and February 2022 were studied. Both groups were  treated with 200mg of Remdesivir, followed by 100 mg daily intravenous injections  for five days; signs and symptoms, such as pain, shortness of breath, cough,  fever and etc., of patients at the initiation and the end of treatment were  recorded. Moreover, the patients' blood oxygen saturation was assessed two to  three times a day, and the mean of the recorded measures was considered as the  daily oxygen saturation. The outpatient group had to visit the hospital daily for  treatment and assessment. At the treatment's end, mortality rates, disease signs,  and symptoms alleviations were compared between the groups. RESULTS: The  outpatient and hospitalized group's mean age was 40.30 ± 12.25 and 37.70 ± 12.00  years, and 51.2% and 55.9% were males, respectively. There was no statistical  difference between baseline and clinical characteristics in the outpatients and  hospitalized groups. After adjusting for oxygen saturation at baseline and gender  in the multivariable Cox regression analysis, the risk of death did not  statistically differ between the hospitalized and outpatient group (hazard ratio:  0.99, 95% confidence interval: 0.39-2.50)) at the end of the study. CONCLUSION:  Based on the results of this study, the outcome, signs, and symptoms of inpatient  and outpatient Remdesivir treatment groups did not differ significantly. Hence in  COVID-19 surges where we have limitations in admitting patients, outpatient  Remdesivir treatment for those without any underlying diseases can be a proper  management method.

AB  - Despite new antivirals are being approved against SARS-CoV-2 they suffer from significant constraints and are not indicated for hospitalized patients, who are  left with few antiviral options. Repurposed drugs have previously shown  controversial clinical results and it remains difficult to understand why certain  trials delivered positive results and other trials failed. Our manuscript  contributes to explaining the puzzle: this might have been caused by a suboptimal  drug exposure and, consequently, an incomplete virus suppression, also because  the drugs have mostly been used as add-on monotherapies. As with other viruses  (e.g., HIV and HCV) identifying synergistic combinations among such drugs could  overcome monotherapy-related limitations. In a cell culture model for SARS-CoV-2  infection the following stringent criteria were adopted to assess drug  combinations: 1) identify robust, synergistic antiviral activity with no increase  in cytotoxicity, 2) identify the lowest drug concentration inhibiting the virus  by 100% (LIC100) and 3) understand whether the LIC100 could be reached in the  lung at clinically indicated drug doses. Among several combinations tested,  remdesivir with either azithromycin or ivermectin synergistically increased the  antiviral activity with no increase in cytotoxicity, improving the therapeutic  index and lowering the LIC100 of every one of the drugs to levels that are  expected to be achievable and maintained in the lung for a therapeutically  relevant period of time. These results are consistent with recent clinical  observations showing that intensive care unit admission was significantly delayed  by the combination of AZI and RDV, but not by RDV alone, and could have immediate  implications for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 as the  proposed "drug cocktails" should have antiviral activity against present and  future SARS-CoV-2 variants without significant overlapping toxicity, while  minimizing the onset of drug resistance. Our results also provide a validated  methodology to help sort out which combination of drugs are most likely to be  efficacious in vivo, based on their in vitro activity, potential synergy and PK  profiles.

AB  - Study Background & Objective: After the influenza pandemic (1918), COVID-19 was declared a Vth pandemic by the WHO in 2020. SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA-enveloped  single-stranded virus. Based on the structure and life cycle, Protease (3CLpro),  RdRp, ACE2, IL-6, and TMPRSS2 are the major targets for drug development against  COVID-19. Pre-existing several drugs (FDA-approved) are used to inhibit the above  targets in different diseases. In coronavirus treatment, these drugs are also in  different clinical trial stages. Remdesivir (RdRp inhibitor) is the only  FDA-approved medicine for coronavirus treatment. In the present study, by using  the drug repurposing strategy, 70 preexisting clinical or under clinical trial  molecules were used in scrutiny for RdRp inhibitor potent molecules in  coronavirus treatment being surveyed via docking studies. Molecular simulation  studies further confirmed the binding mechanism and stability of the most potent  compounds. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Docking studies were performed using the Maestro  12.9 module of Schrodinger software over 70 molecules with RdRp as the target and  remdesivir as the standard drug and further confirmed by simulation studies.  RESULTS: The docking studies showed that many HIV protease inhibitors  demonstrated remarkable binding interactions with the target RdRp. Protease  inhibitors such as lopinavir and ritonavir are effective. Along with these,  AT-527, ledipasvir, bicalutamide, and cobicistat showed improved docking scores.  RMSD and RMSF were further analyzed for potent ledipasvir and ritonavir by  simulation studies and were identified as potential candidates for corona  disease. CONCLUSION: The drug repurposing approach provides a new avenue in  COVID-19 treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 outcomes exist, but whether in-hospital care explains this difference is not known. We sought to determine  racial and ethnic differences in demographics, comorbidities, in-hospital  treatments, and in-hospital outcomes of patients hospitalized with COVID-19.  METHODS AND FINDINGS: This was a cohort study using MiCOVID-19, a multi-center,  retrospective, collaborative quality improvement registry, which included data on  patients hospitalized with COVID-19 across 38 hospitals in the State of Michigan.  2,639 adult patients with COVID-19 hospitalized at a site participating in the  MiCOVID-19 Registry were randomly selected. Outcomes included in-hospital  mortality, age at death, intensive care unit admission, and need for invasive  mechanical ventilation by race and ethnicity. Baseline comorbidities differed by  race and ethnicity. In addition, Black patients had higher lactate dehydrogenase,  erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, creatine phosphokinase, and  ferritin levels. Black patients were less likely to receive dexamethasone and  remdesivir compared with White patients (4.2% vs 14.3% and 2.2% vs. 11.8%, p <  0.001 for each). Black (18.7%) and White (19.6%) patients experienced greater  mortality compared with Asian (13.0%) and Latino (5.9%) patients (p < 0.01). The  mean age at death was significantly lower by 8 years for Black patients (69.4 ±  13.3 years) compared with White (77.9 ± 12.6), Asian (77.6 ± 6.6), and Latino  patients (77.4 ± 15.5) (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 mortality appears to be  driven by both pre-hospitalization clinical and social factors and potentially  in-hospital care. Policies aimed at population health and equitable application  of evidence-based medical therapy are needed to alleviate the burden of COVID-19.

AB  - Remdesivir is a leading therapy in patients with moderate to severe coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection; the majority of whom are older individuals. Remdesivir is  a nucleoside analog that incorporates into nascent viral RNA, inhibiting  RNA-directed RNA polymerases, including that of SARS-CoV-2. Less is known about  remdesivir's effects on mitochondria, particularly in older adults where  mitochondria are known to be dysfunctional. Furthermore, its effect on  age-induced mitochondrial mutations and copy number has not been previously  studied. We hypothesized that remdesivir adversely affects mtDNA copy number and  deletion mutation frequency in aged rodents. To test this hypothesis,  30-month-old male F333BNF1 rats were treated with remdesivir for three months. To  determine if remdesivir adversely affects mtDNA, we measured copy number and  mtDNA deletion frequency in rat hearts, kidneys, and skeletal muscles using  digital PCR. We found no effects from three months of remdesivir treatment on  mtDNA copy number or deletion mutation frequency in 33-month-old rats. These data  support the notion that remdesivir does not compromise mtDNA quality or quantity  at old age in mammals. Future work should focus on examining additional tissues  such as brain and liver, and extend testing to human clinical samples.

AB  - On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic a public health  emergency of international concern. The viral outbreak led in turn to an  exponential growth of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases, that is, a  multiorgan disease that has led to more than 6.3 million deaths worldwide, as of  June 2022. There are currently few effective drugs approved for treatment of  SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 patients. Many of the compounds tested so far have been  selected through a drug repurposing approach, that is, by identifying novel  indications for drugs already approved for other conditions. We here present an  up-to-date review of the main Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs  repurposed against SARS-CoV-2 infection, discussing their mechanism of action and  their most important preclinical and clinical results. Reviewed compounds were  chosen to privilege those that have been approved for use in SARS-CoV-2 patients  or that have completed phase III clinical trials. Moreover, we also summarize the  evidence on some novel and promising repurposed drugs in the pipeline. Finally,  we discuss the current stage and possible steps toward the development of broadly  effective drug combinations to suppress the onset or progression of COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In late 2019, a highly infectious and pathogenic coronavirus was recognized as Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes  acute respiratory disease, threatening human health and public safety. A total of  448,327,303 documented cases and 6,028,576 deaths have been reported as of March  8th 2022. The COVID-19 vaccines currently undergoing clinical trials or already  in use should provide at least some protection against SARS-CoV-2; however, the  emergence of new variations as a result of mutations may lessen the effectiveness  of the currently available vaccines. Since the efficacy of available drugs and  vaccines against COVID-19 is notably lower, there is an urgent need to develop a  potential drug to treat this deadly disease. The SARS-CoV-2 spike (SCoV-SG) is  the foremost drug target among coronaviruses. OBJECTIVE: The major objectives of  the current study are to conduct a molecular docking study investigation of  TAT-peptide(47-57)(GRKKRRQRRRP)-conjugated remodified therapeutics such as  ritonavir (RTV), lopinavir (LPV), favipiravir (FPV), remdesivir (RMV),  hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), molnupiravir (MNV) and nirmatrelvir (NMV) with  (SCoV-SG) structure. METHODS: Molecular docking analysis was performed to study  the interaction of repurposed drugs and drugs conjugated with the TAT-peptide  with target SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (PDB ID: 6VYB) using Auto- Dock.  Further docking investigation was completed with PatchDock and was visualized by  the discovery of the studio visualizer 2020. RESULTS: TAT-peptides are  well-characterized immune enhancers that are used in intracellular drug delivery.  The results of molecular docking analysis showed higher efficiency and  significantly enhanced and improved interactions between TP-conjugated repurposed  drugs and the target sites of the SCoV-SG structure. CONCLUSION: The study  concluded that TP-conjugated repurposed drugs may be effective in preventing  COVID- 19, and therefore, in vitro, in vivo, and clinical trial studies are  required in detail.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence regarding the impact of remdesivir (RDV) on SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance (VC) is scarce. The aim of this study was to compare VC timing in  hospitalized COVID-19 patients who did or did not receive RDV. METHODS: This was  a matched-cohort study of patients hospitalized with pneumonia, a  SARS-CoV-2-positive nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) at admission, and at least one NPS  during follow-up. Patients who received RDV (cases) and those who did not  (controls) were matched in a 1:2 ratio by age, sex, and PaO(2)/FiO(2) (P/F)  values at admission. NPSs were analyzed using real-time polymerase chain  reaction. Time to VC (within 30 days after hospital discharge) was estimated  using the Kaplan-Meier curve. A multivariable Cox proportional hazard model was  fitted to determine factors associated with VC. RESULTS: There were 648 patients  enrolled in the study (216 cases and 432 controls). VC was observed in 490  patients (75.6%), with a median time of 25 (IQR 16-34) days. Overall, time to VC  was similar between cases and controls (p = 0.519). However, time to VC was  different when considering both RDV treatment status and age (p = 0.007). A  significant finding was also observed when considering both RDV treatment status  and P/F values at admission (p = 0.007). A multivariate analysis showed that VC  was associated with a younger age (aHR = 0.990, 95% CI 0.983-0.998 per every  10-year increase in age; p = 0.009) and a higher baseline P/F ratio (aHR=1.275,  95% CI 1.029-1.579; p=0.026), but not with RDV treatment status. CONCLUSION: Time  to VC was similar in cases and controls. However, there was a benefit associated  with using RDV in regard to time to VC in younger patients and in those with a  P/F ratio ≤200 mmHg at hospital admission.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Remdesivir is the only antiviral treatment that has been shown to be useful against SARS-CoV-2 infection. It shorts hospitalization time compared to  placebo. Its effects in Kidney transplant (KT) patients are limited to some  published cases. METHODS: We performed a retrospective observational study that  included all KT patients admitted between August 01, 2020 and December 31, 2020  with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who received remdesivir. The objective of this study  was to describe the experience of a cohort of KT patients treated with  remdesivir. DISCUSSION: A total of 37 KT patients developed SARS-CoV-2 infection,  7 of them received treatment with remdesivir. The rest of the patients did not  receive the drug due to either CKD-EPI less than 30 mL/min or they did not  present clinical criteria. In addition to remdesivir, all pacients received  dexamethasone and anticoagulation therapy. 4 were men, the median age was 59  (53-71) years. Median time from transplantation was 43 (16-82) months. Chest  X-rays of all patients showed pulmonary infiltrates and required low oxygen flow  therapy upon admission, requiring high flow nasal therapy in 3 cases. Only 2  cases presented deterioration of the graft function, not requiring hemodialysis  in any case, and all recovered renal function at hospital discharge. 2 patients  rise up 1.5 times the liver function test. No patient died or required admission  to the critical care unit. Median days of admission was 12 (9-27) days.  CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the use of remdesivir could be useful in KT  patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia without side effects. Additional studies are  necessary with a larger number of patients to improve the knowledge of this drug  in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical trials that are registered on the Clinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI) portal for a year, for the treatment, prevention,  and supportive therapy of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). MATERIALS AND  METHODS: All the trials registered on CTRI (since January 2020 till January 2021)  for therapeutic, preventive, and supportive interventions for COVID-19 were  searched with the keywords "Coronavirus," "COVID-19," "SARS-COV-2," and  "2019-nCoV". These registered studies were analyzed as follows: Trials under  different systems of  Medicine-Allopathy/Homeopathy/Ayurveda/Unani/Yoga/Naturopathy. The Allopathy  trials were further analyzed in detail: Intervention, design, comparator, number  of subjects, duration, and approvals taken. RESULTS: A total of 1597 records were  found. After excluding the overlaps, behavioral and other studies conducted to  understand the diagnosis, epidemiology, a total of 419 registered studies were  included for further analysis. Out of these 419 studies, 166 (39.6%) were in  Ayurveda, 154 (36.7%) in Allopathy, 33 (7.8%) in Homeopathy, 30 (7%) in  Unani/Siddha, 18 (4.3%) in Yoga and Naturopathy and 18 (4.3%) in Nutraceuticals.  A total of 264 interventions had been registered in 419 clinical trials.  Sixty-seven interventions were being studied under allopathy in 154 studies. Same  product was being evaluated in differently designed protocols with different  endpoints. Maximum number of trials and subjects were for Hydroxychloroquine 25  (17,998), Ivermectin 11 (2820), Convalescent Plasma 11 (3982), Remdesivir 8  (3725), Tocilizumab 6 (884), and Azithromycin 6 (582). CONCLUSIONS: In response  to the COVID-19 pandemic, Indian researchers came forward from all the systems of  medicine to evaluate interventions for prophylaxis or treatment of the disease.  The involvement of AYUSH systems of medicine was specifically more in this  regard. A wide variation and heterogeneity in doses and outcomes were observed in  trial designs which might make it difficult to generalize the study results when  they are made available. Urgent analyses of studies involving interventions on  the treatment advisory of the Government may help the healthcare providers take  more informed decisions for managing COVID-19 patients in India.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of remdesivir in the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 remains ill-defined. We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis  alongside the Canadian Treatments for COVID-19 (CATCO) open-label, randomized  clinical trial evaluating remdesivir. METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 in Canadian  hospitals from Aug. 14, 2020, to Apr. 1, 2021, were randomly assigned to receive  remdesivir plus usual care versus usual care alone. Taking a public health care  payer's perspective, we collected in-hospital outcomes and health care resource  utilization alongside estimated unit costs in 2020 Canadian dollars over a time  horizon from randomization to hospital discharge or death. Data from 1281 adults  admitted to 52 hospitals in 6 Canadian provinces were analyzed. RESULTS: The  total mean cost per patient was $37 918 (standard deviation [SD] $42 413; 95%  confidence interval [CI] $34 617 to $41 220) for patients randomly assigned to  the remdesivir group and $38 026 (SD $46 021; 95% CI $34 480 to $41 573) for  patients receiving usual care (incremental cost -$108 [95% CI -$4953 to $4737], p  > 0.9). The difference in proportions of in-hospital deaths between remdesivir  and usual care groups was -3.9% (18.7% v. 22.6%, 95% CI -8.3% to 1.0%, p = 0.09).  The difference in proportions of incident invasive mechanical ventilation events  between groups was -7.0% (8.0% v. 15.0%, 95% CI -10.6% to -3.4%, p = 0.006),  whereas the difference in proportions of total mechanical ventilation events  between groups was -5.7% (16.4% v. 22.1%, 95% CI -10.0% to -1.4%, p = 0.01).  Remdesivir was the dominant intervention (but only marginally less costly, with  mildly lower mortality) with an incalculable incremental cost effectiveness  ratio; we report results of incremental costs and incremental effects separately.  For willingness-to-pay thresholds of $0, $20 000, $50 000 and $100 000 per death  averted, a strategy using remdesivir was cost-effective in 60%, 67%, 74% and 79%  of simulations, respectively. The remdesivir costs were the fifth highest cost  driver, offset by shorter lengths of stay and less mechanical ventilation.  INTERPRETATION: From a health care payer perspective, treating patients  hospitalized with COVID-19 with remdesivir and usual care appears to be  preferrable to treating with usual care alone, albeit with marginal incremental  cost and small clinical effects. The added cost of remdesivir was offset by  shorter lengths of stay in the intensive care unit and less need for ventilation.  STUDY REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials. gov, no. NCT04330690.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify various emerging diagnostics parameters of coronavirus disease 2019 related to disease progression and fatality. METHODS: The  cross-sectional study was conducted at Mardan Medical Complex, Khyber  Pakhtunkhwah, Pakistan, from February 9, 2021, to April 21, 2021, and comprised  patients of either gender aged >18 years diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019  on the basis of polymerase chain reaction testing and who were admitted to the  hospital using the World Health Organisation interim guidelines. Disease  progression was categorised as mild, moderate, severe and critical, and they were  monitored closely till the final outcome. Data was analysed using SPSS 26.  RESULTS: Of the 408 patients, 215(52.69%) were male and 193(47.30%) were female.  The overall median age of the sample was 55 years (interquartile range: 18-84  years). Symptoms included cough 92(22.54%), fever 80(19.60%), shortness of breath  78(19.60%), fatigue 60(14.70%) and loss of smell and test 52(12.74%), while  46(11.27%) were asymptomatic. Azithromycin was the most used drug 304(74.50%),  while antiviral Remdesivir was given to 279(68.38%) patients and hydrocortisone  to 143(35.04%). Plasma treatment was given to 55(13.48%) patients and mechanical  ventilation to 87(21.32%). Compared to baseline, disease progression was mild in  72(17.64%) patients, moderate 96(23.52%), severe 98(24.01%) and critical in  89(21.81%), while no change was seen 53(12.99%) cases. Severity level was  significantly associated with liver and renal function parameters (p<0.05).  Overall, 47(11.51%) patients died. CONCLUSIONS: Different severity levels during  hospitalisation among patients of coronavirus disease 2019 were noted, and  severity level was significantly associated with liver and renal function  parameters.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe differences by race and ethnicity in treatment patterns among hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the US from March-August 2020. METHODS:  Among patients in de-identified Optum electronic health record data hospitalized  with COVID-19 (March-August 2020), we estimated odds ratios of receiving COVID-19  treatments of interest (azithromycin, dexamethasone, hydroxychloroquine,  remdesivir, and other steroids) at hospital admission, by race and ethnicity,  after adjusting for key covariates of interest. RESULTS: After adjusting for key  covariates, Black/African American patients were less likely to receive  dexamethasone (adj. OR [95% CI]: 0.83 [0.71, 0.96]) and more likely to receive  other steroids corticosteroids (adj. OR [95% CI]: 2.13 [1.90, 2.39]), relative to  White patients. Hispanic/Latino patients were less likely to receive  dexamethasone than Not Hispanic/Latino patients (adj. OR [95% CI]: 0.69 [0.58,  0.82]). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that COVID-19 treatments patients  received in Optum varied by race and ethnicity after adjustment for other  possible explanatory factors. In the face of rapidly evolving treatment  landscapes, policies are needed to ensure equitable access to novel and  repurposed therapeutics to avoid disparities in care by race and ethnicity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV- 2) variants with novel spike protein mutations has been shown to be  influencing the epidemiological and clinical aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic.  OBJECTIVE: Due to studies showing various dietary benefits of zinc as a viral  replication inhibitor as well as an immunity enhancer, organometallic complexes  incorporating zinc ions can be ideal antiviral candidates due to their structural  variation and diverse stereochemistry. METHODS: In silico studies were conducted  for the virtual screening of zinc complexes with SARSCoV- 2 and host proteins to  explore their effect on viral entry and replication activity. Molegro Virtual  Docker along with AutoDock was used for the identification of potential  SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor complexes from the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD).  Molecular dynamics (MD), density functional theory (DFT), chemical absorption,  distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity properties (ADMET) were used to  support the findings from virtual screening. RESULTS: In correlation with  SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and spike receptorbinding domain bound  with ACE2 docking results, the compound (bis(3,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrazole)-  bis(2-furoato)-zinc(ii)) (CSD code ECOZAA) occurs to be a potential metal complex  SARS-CoV-2 receptor inhibitor. The compound ECOZAA was observed (in silico  binding affinity = - 179.29kcal/mol) to behave better than the clinically  approved drug Remdesivir (in silico binding affinity = -62.69kcal/mol) against  SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The large HOMO- LUMO gap for the ECOZAA  compound is an indication of the low chemical reactivity as well as the great  kinetic stability of the compound. CONCLUSION: Thus, this study highlights the  potential use of zinc metal complexes as SARS-CoV-2 viral entry and replication  inhibitors.

AB  - Background: COVID-19 has become a global threat. Since its first outbreak from Wuhan, China in December 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has gone through structural  changes arising due to mutations in its surface glycoprotein. These mutations  have led to the emergence of different genetic variants threatening public health  due to increased transmission and virulence. As new drug development is a long  process, repurposing existing antiviral drugs with potential activity against  SARS-CoV-2 might be a possible solution to mitigate the current situation.  Methods: This study focused on utilizing molecular docking to determine the  effect of potential drugs on several variants of concern (VOCs). The effect of  various drugs such as baricitinib, favipiravir, lopinavir, remdesivir and  dexamethasone, which might have the potential to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections as  evident from previous studies, was investigated for different VOCs. Results:  Remdesivir showed promising results for B.1.351 variant (binding energy: -7.3  kcal/mol) with residues Gln319 and Val503 facilitating strong binding.  Favipiravir showed favorable results against B.1.1.7 (binding energy: -5.6  kcal/mol), B.1.351 (binding energy: -5.1 kcal/mol) and B.1.617.2 (binding energy:  -5 kcal/mol). Molecular dynamics simulation for favipiravir/B.1.1.7 was conducted  and showed significant results in agreement with our findings. Conclusions: From  structural modeling and molecular docking experiments, it is evident that  mutations outside the receptor binding domain of surface glycoprotein do not have  a sharp impact on drug binding affinity. Thus, the potential use of these drugs  should be explored further for their antiviral effect against SARS-CoV-2 VOCs.

AB  - We recently published a preliminary assessment of the activity of a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, stenoparib, also known as 2X-121, which  inhibits viral replication by affecting pathways of the host. Here we show that  stenoparib effectively inhibits a SARS-CoV-2 wild type (BavPat1/2020) strain and  four additional variant strains; alpha (B.1.1.7), beta (B.1.351), delta  (B.1.617.2) and gamma (P.1) in vitro, with 50% effective concentration (EC50)  estimates of 4.1 μM, 8.5 μM, 24.1 μM, 8.2 μM and 13.6 μM, respectively. A  separate experiment focusing on a combination of 10 μM stenoparib and 0.5 μM  remdesivir, an antiviral drug, resulted in over 80% inhibition of the alpha  variant, which is substantially greater than the effect achieved with either drug  alone, suggesting at least additive effects from combining the different  mechanisms of activity of stenoparib and remdesivir.

AB  - The unprecedented worldwide spread of SARS-CoV-2 has imposed severe challenges on global health care systems. The roll-out and widespread administration of  COVID-19 vaccines has been deemed a major milestone in the race to restrict the  severity of the infection. Vaccines have as yet not entirely suppressed the  relentless progression of the pandemic, due mainly to the emergence of new virus  variants, and also secondary to the waning of protective antibody titers over  time. Encouragingly, an increasing number of antiviral drugs, such as remdesivir  and the newly developed drug combination, Paxlovid(®) (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir),  as well as molnupiravir, have shown significant benefits for COVID-19 patient  outcomes. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has been proven to be an effective  preventive strategy in high-risk uninfected people exposed to HIV. Building on  knowledge from what is already known about the use of PrEP for HIV disease, and  from recently gleaned knowledge of antivirals used against COVID-19, we propose  that SARS-CoV-2 PrEP, using specific antiviral and adjuvant drugs against  SARS-CoV-2, may represent a novel preventive strategy for high-risk populations,  including healthcare workers, immunodeficient individuals, and poor vaccine  responders. Herein, we critically review the risk factors for severe COVID-19 and  discuss PrEP strategies against SARS-CoV-2. In addition, we outline details of  candidate anti-SARS-CoV-2 PrEP drugs, thus creating a framework with respect to  the development of alternative and/or complementary strategies to prevent  COVID-19, and contributing to the global armamentarium that has been developed to  limit SARS-CoV-2 infection, severity, and transmission.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was found to cause complications in certain groups of people, leading to hospitalization. Several factors have been linked to  this, such as gender, age, comorbidity, and race. Understanding the precise  reasons for the COVID-19-induced complications might help in designing strategies  to minimize hospitalization. A retrospective, cross-sectional observational study  was conducted for patients in a COVID-19-designated specialty hospital after  obtaining ethical clearance. Patients' demographic and clinical characteristics,  such as age, gender, race, vaccinated status, complications, comorbidities, and  medications, were retrieved from the hospital medical database. The data were  statistically analyzed to determine the association between the predictors and  the outcomes of COVID-19. An odds ratio (both unadjusted and adjusted) analysis  was carried out to determine the risk factors for hospitalization [non-intensive  care (non-ICU) and intensive care (ICU)] due to COVID-19. The data from the study  indicated that the majority of patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 were male  (>55%), aged > 60 years (>40%), married (>80%), and unvaccinated (>71%). The  common symptoms, complications, comorbidities, and medications were fever,  pneumonia, hypertension, and prednisolone, respectively. Male gender, patients  older than 60 years, unemployed, unvaccinated, complicated, and comorbid patients  had an odds ratio of more than 2 and were found to be significantly (p < 0.05)  higher in ICU admission. In addition, administration of prednisolone and  remdesivir was found to significantly reduce (p < 0.05) the odds ratio in ICU  patients. The analysis of the data suggested that male gender, age above 60  years, and unvaccinated with comorbidities increased the complications and  resulted in hospitalization, including ICU admission. Hypertension and type 2  diabetes associated with obesity as metabolic syndrome could be considered one of  the major risk factors. Preventive strategies need to be directed toward these  risk factors to reduce the complications, as well as hospitalization to defeat  the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic has stimulated growing research on treatment options. We aim to provide an overview of the characteristics of studies  evaluating COVID-19 treatment. DESIGN: Rapid scoping review DATA SOURCES:  Medline, Embase and biorxiv/medrxiv from inception to 15 May 2021. SETTING:  Hospital and community care. PARTICIPANTS: COVID-19 patients of all ages.  INTERVENTIONS: COVID-19 treatment. RESULTS: The literature search identified 616  relevant primary studies of which 188 were randomised controlled trials and 299  relevant evidence syntheses. The studies and evidence syntheses were conducted in  51 and 39 countries, respectively.Most studies enrolled patients admitted to  acute care hospitals (84%), included on average 169 participants, with an average  age of 60 years, study duration of 28 days, number of effect outcomes of four and  number of harm outcomes of one. The most common primary outcome was death  (32%).The included studies evaluated 214 treatment options. The most common  treatments were tocilizumab (11%), hydroxychloroquine (9%) and convalescent  plasma (7%). The most common therapeutic categories were non-steroidal  immunosuppressants (18%), steroids (15%) and antivirals (14%). The most common  therapeutic categories involving multiple drugs were antimalarials/antibiotics  (16%), steroids/non-steroidal immunosuppressants (9%) and  antimalarials/antivirals/antivirals (7%). The most common treatments evaluated in  systematic reviews were hydroxychloroquine (11%), remdesivir (8%), tocilizumab  (7%) and steroids (7%).The evaluated treatment was in favour 50% and 36% of the  evaluations, according to the conclusion of the authors of primary studies and  evidence syntheses, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This rapid scoping review  characterised a growing body of comparative-effectiveness primary studies and  evidence syntheses. The results suggest future studies should focus on children,  elderly ≥65 years of age, patients with mild symptoms, outpatient treatment,  multimechanism therapies, harms and active comparators. The results also suggest  that future living evidence synthesis and network meta-analysis would provide  additional information for decision-makers on managing COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Data from the National Clinical Registry for COVID-19 (NCRC) were analyzed with an aim to describe the clinical characteristics, course  and outcomes of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the third wave of the  pandemic and compare them with patients admitted earlier. METHODS: The NCRC,  launched in September 2020, is a multicentre observational initiative, which  provided the platform for the current investigation. Demographic, clinical,  treatment and outcome data of hospitalized COVID-19 patients were captured in an  electronic data portal from 38 hospitals across India. Patients enrolled during  December 16, 2021 to January 17, 2022 were considered representative of the third  wave of COVID-19 and compared with those registered during November 15 to  December 15, 2021, representative of the tail end of the second wave. RESULTS:  Between November 15, 2021 and January 17, 2022, 3230 patients were recruited in  NCRC. Patients admitted in the third wave were significantly younger than those  admitted earlier (46.7±20.5 vs. 54.6±18 yr). The patients admitted in the third  wave had a lower requirement of drugs including steroids, interleukin (IL)-6  inhibitors and remdesivir as well as lower oxygen supplementation and mechanical  ventilation. They had improved hospital outcomes with significantly lower  in-hospital mortality (11.2 vs. 15.1%). The outcomes were better among the fully  vaccinated when compared to the unvaccinated or partially vaccinated.  INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of illness and outcomes were observed  to be different in the third wave compared to the last wave. Hospitalized  patients were younger with fewer comorbidities, decreased symptoms and improved  outcomes, with fully vaccinated patients faring better than the unvaccinated and  partially vaccinated ones.

AB  - Alloimmune responses in kidney transplant (KT) patients previously hospitalized with COVID-19 are understudied. We analyzed a cohort of 112 kidney transplant  recipients who were hospitalized following a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result  during the first 20 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. We found a cumulative  incidence of 17% for the development of new donor-specific antibodies (DSA) or  increased levels of pre-existing DSA in hospitalized SARS-CoV-2-infected KT  patients. This risk extended 8 months post-infection. These changes in DSA status  were associated with late allograft dysfunction. Risk factors for new or  increased DSA responses in this KT patient cohort included the presence of  circulating DSA pre-COVID-19 diagnosis and time post-transplantation. COVID-19  vaccination prior to infection and remdesivir administration during infection  were each associated with decreased likelihood of developing a new or increased  DSA response. These data show that new or enhanced DSA responses frequently occur  among KT patients requiring admission with COVID-19 and suggest that  surveillance, vaccination, and antiviral therapies may be important tools to  prevent alloimmunity in these individuals.

AB  - For a while, coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has been a major global pandemic. It primarily affects the respiratory system but has extrapulmonary  manifestations such as gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms. Data on  myasthenia gravis (MG), as a complication of COVID-19, are limited. We herein  report the manifestation of ocular MG as an initial symptom of COVID-19. In  November 2020, a 31-year-old healthy woman was referred to Firoozgar Hospital  (Tehran, Iran) with left upper eyelid ptosis and diplopia as well as general  weakness, myalgia, fever, and nasal congestion for four days prior to admission.  Although the acetylcholine receptor antibody in her serum was negative, increased  jitter in several muscles led to the diagnosis of ocular MG. Nasal swab reverse  transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay tested positive for severe  acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Computed  tomography (CT) scan of the chest revealed bilateral ground-glass opacities and  some foci of consolidation formation, but the thymus was normal. The patient was  successfully treated with remdesivir and dexamethasone. The patient was  eventually discharged in good condition and with improved neurological symptoms.  A limited number of studies have suggested a possible association between MG and  COVID-19. Therefore, further data are required to substantiate the proposed  association. Clinicians should be aware of ocular MG during the COVID-19 pandemic  to better diagnose and manage patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - COVID-19, a dreaded and highly contagious pandemic, is flagrantly known for its rapid prevalence across the world. Till date, none of the treatments are  distinctly accessible for this life-threatening disease. Under the prevailing  conditions of a medical emergency, one creative strategy for the identification  of novel and potential antiviral agents gaining momentum in research institutions  and progressively being leveraged by pharmaceutical companies is target-based  drug repositioning/repurposing. Continuous monitoring and recording of results  offer anticipation that this strategy may help to reveal new medications for  viral infections. This review recapitulates the neoteric illation of COVID-19,  its genomic dispensation, molecular evolution via phylogenetic assessment, drug  targets, the most frequently worldwide used repurposed drugs and their  therapeutic applications, and a recent update on vaccine management strategies.  The available data from solidarity trials exposed that the treatment with several  known drugs, viz. lopinavir-ritonavir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, etc. had  displayed various antagonistic effects along with no impactful result in the  diminution of mortality rate. The drugs, like remdesivir, favipiravir, and  ribavirin, have proved to be quite safer therapeutic options for treatment  against COVID-19. Similarly, dexamethasone, convalescent plasma therapy and oral  administration of 2DG are expected to reduce the mortality rate of COVID-19  patients.

AB  - The effects of casirivimab and imdevimab (C/I) on the innate immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection remain unclear. We evaluated the effect of C/I on  type I interferon (IFN-I) and cytokines in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.  This prospective observational study recruited consecutive patients hospitalized  with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Blood levels of IFN-I and cytokines before and after  C/I administration were assessed using enzyme-linked immunoassay. The study  enrolled 29 patients in the C/I group. In addition, 11 patients who received  remdesivir and dexamethasone (R/D group) during the early phase (≤5 days after  the onset of symptoms) were included as a comparator group. After treatment,  IFN-α and IFN-β levels decreased significantly in both the C/I group and R/D  group, whilst the post-treatment neutrophil-to-lymphoid ratio increased in the  early C/I group but not the R/D group. In the C/I group, temporal temperature  elevation and hypoxemia were observed after treatment in 58.6% and 41.4% of the  cohort, respectively. However, most patients recovered by 5 days after treatment.  This study could demonstrate the high therapeutic effect of C/I with an  antibody-dependent enhancement-like response and decreased IFN-I production,  which was likely due to the immediate induction of an antibody-dependent immune  response against SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants may escape monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and antiviral drugs. By using live virus assays, we assessed the ex vivo inhibition  of the B.1 wild-type (WT), delta and omicron BA.1 and BA.2 lineages by  post-infusion sera from 40 individuals treated with bamlanivimab/etesevimab  (BAM/ETE), casirivimab/imdevimab (CAS/IMD), and sotrovimab (SOT) as well as the  activity of remdesivir, nirmatrelvir and molnupiravir. mAbs and drug activity  were defined as the serum dilution (ID(50)) and drug concentration (IC(50)),  respectively, showing 50% protection of virus-induced cytopathic effect. All  pre-infusion sera were negative for SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity. BAM/ETE,  CAS/IMD, and SOT showed activity against the WT (ID(50) 6295 (4355-8075) for  BAM/ETE; 18,214 (16,248-21,365) for CAS/IMD; and 456 (265-592) for SOT) and the  delta (14,780 (ID(50) 10,905-21,020) for BAM/ETE; 63,937 (47,211-79,971) for  CAS/IMD; and 1103 (843-1334) for SOT). Notably, only SOT was active against BA.1  (ID(50) 200 (37-233)), whereas BA.2 was neutralized by CAS/IMD (ID(50) 174  (134-209) ID(50)) and SOT (ID(50) 20 (9-31) ID(50)), but not by BAM/ETE. No  significant inter-variant IC(50) differences were observed for molnupiravir (1.5  ± 0.1/1.5 ± 0.7/1.0 ± 0.5/0.8 ± 0.01 μM for WT/delta/BA.1/BA.2, respectively),  nirmatrelvir (0.05 ± 0.02/0.06 ± 0.01/0.04 ± 0.02/0.04 ± 0.01 μM) or remdesivir  (0.08 ± 0.04/0.11 ± 0.08/0.05 ± 0.04/0.08 ± 0.01 μM). Continued evolution of  SARS-CoV-2 requires updating the mAbs arsenal, although antivirals have so far  remained unaffected.

AB  - New variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continue to emerge, causing surges, breakthrough infections, and devastating  losses-underscoring the importance of identifying SARS-CoV-2 antivirals. A  simple, accessible human cell culture model permissive to SARS-CoV-2 variants is  critical for identifying and assessing antivirals in a high-throughput manner.  Although human alveolar A549 cells are a valuable model for studying respiratory  virus infections, they lack two essential host factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection:  angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2  (TMPRSS2). SARS-CoV-2 uses the ACE2 receptor for viral entry and TMPRSS2 to prime  the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, both of which are negligibly expressed in A549  cells. Here, we report the generation of a suitable human cell line for  SARS-CoV-2 studies by transducing human ACE2 and TMPRSS2 into A549 cells. We show  that subclones highly expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 ("ACE2plus" and the subclone  "ACE2plusC3") are susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2, including the delta  and omicron variants. These subclones express more ACE2 and TMPRSS2 transcripts  than existing commercial A549 cells engineered to express ACE2 and TMPRSS2.  Additionally, the antiviral drugs EIDD-1931, remdesivir, nirmatrelvir, and  nelfinavir strongly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 variants in our infection model. Our data  show that ACE2plusC3 cells are highly permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection and can  be used to identify anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) pandemic has dramatically impacted liver organ transplantation. The American Society of Transplantation recommends a  minimum of 28 days after symptom resolution for organ donation. However, the  exact time for transplantation for recipients is unknown. Considering that  mortality on the waiting list for patients with MELD >25 or fulminant hepatitis  is higher than that of COVID-19, the best time for surgery after SARS-CoV-2  infection remains undetermined. This study aims to expand the current knowledge  regarding the Liver Transplantation (LT) time for patients after COVID-19 and to  provide transplant physicians with essential decision-making tools to manage  these critically ill patients during the pandemic. METHODS: Systematic review of  patients who underwent liver transplantation after diagnosis of COVID-19. The  MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane, Lilacs, Embase, and Scielo databases were searched  until June 20, 2021. The MESH terms used were "COVID-19" and "Liver  transplantation". RESULTS: 558 articles were found; of these 13 articles and a  total of 18 cases of COVID-19 prior to liver transplantation were reported. The  mean age was 38.7±14.6, with male prevalence. Most had mild symptoms of COVID.  Five patients have specific treatment for COVID-19 with convalescent plasm or  remdesivir/oseltamivir, just one patient received hydroxychloroquine, and  12 patients received only symptomatic treatment. The median time between COVID-19  to LT was 19 days (13.5‒44.5). Deceased donor liver transplantation accounted  for 61% of cases, while living donor transplantation was 39%. CONCLUSION: Despite  the concerns regarding the postoperative evolution, the mortality of patients  with high MELD or fulminant hepatitis transplanted shortly after COVID-19  diagnosis does not seem to be higher.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Electronic health record (EHR) databases provide an opportunity to facilitate characterization and trends in patients with COVID-19. METHODS:  Patients with COVID-19 were identified based on an ICD-10 diagnosis code for  COVID-19 (U07.1) and/or a positive SARS-CoV-2 viral lab result from January 2020  to November 2020. Patients were characterized in terms of demographics,  healthcare utilization, clinical comorbidities, therapies, laboratory results,  and procedures/care received, including critical care, intubation/ventilation,  and occurrence of death were described, overall and by month. RESULTS: There were  393,773 patients with COVID-19 and 56,996 with a COVID-19 associated  hospitalization. A greater percentage of patients hospitalized with COVID-19  relative to all COVID-19 cases were older, male, African American, and lived in  the Northeast and South. The most common comorbidities before admission/infection  date were hypertension (40.8%), diabetes (29.5%), and obesity (23.8%), and the  most common diagnoses during hospitalization were pneumonia (59.6%), acute  respiratory failure (44.8%), and dyspnea (28.0%). A total of 85.7% of patients  hospitalized with COVID-19 had CRP values > 10 mg/L, 75.5% had fibrinogen values  > 400 mg/dL, and 76.8% had D-dimer values > 250 ng/mL. Median values for  platelets, CRP, lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, and fibrinogen tended to decrease  from January-March to November. The use of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine during  hospitalization peaked by March (71.2%) and was used rarely by May (5.1%) and  less than 1% afterwards, while the use of remdesivir had increased by May (10.0%)  followed by dexamethasone by June (27.7%). All-cause mortality was 3.2% overall  and 15.0% among those hospitalized; 21.0% received critical care and 16.0%  received intubation/ventilation/ECMO. CONCLUSIONS: This study characterizes US  patients with COVID-19 and their management during hospitalization over the first  eleven months of this disease pandemic.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the need to identify new antiviral therapeutics at pace, including through drug repurposing. We employed a Quadratic  Unbounded Binary Optimization (QUBO) model, to search for compounds similar to  Remdesivir, the first antiviral against SARS-CoV-2 approved for human use, using  a quantum-inspired device. We modelled Remdesivir and compounds present in the  DrugBank database as graphs, established the optimal parameters in our algorithm  and resolved the Maximum Weighted Independent Set problem within the conflict  graph generated. We also employed a traditional Tanimoto fingerprint model. The  two methods yielded different lists of lead compounds, with some overlap. While  GS-6620 was the top compound predicted by both models, the QUBO model predicted  BMS-986094 as second best. The Tanimoto model predicted different forms of  cobalamin, also known as vitamin B12. We then determined the half maximal  inhibitory concentration (IC50) values in cell culture models of SARS-CoV-2  infection and assessed cytotoxicity. We also demonstrated efficacy against  several variants including SARS-CoV-2 Strain England 2 (England 02/2020/407073),  B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta) and B.1.617.2 (Delta). Lastly, we employed an in  vitro polymerization assay to demonstrate that these compounds directly inhibit  the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) of SARS-CoV-2. Together, our data reveal  that our QUBO model performs accurate comparisons (BMS-986094) that differed from  those predicted by Tanimoto (different forms of vitamin B12); all compounds  inhibited replication of SARS-CoV-2 via direct action on RdRP, with both models  being useful. While Tanimoto may be employed when performing relatively small  comparisons, QUBO is also accurate and may be well suited for very complex  problems where computational resources may limit the number and/or complexity of  possible combinations to evaluate. Our quantum-inspired screening method can  therefore be employed in future searches for novel pharmacologic inhibitors, thus  providing an approach for accelerating drug deployment.

AB  - Since the emergence of COVID-19, concerted worldwide efforts have taken place to minimize global spread of the contagion. Its widespread effects have also  facilitated evolution of new strains, such as the delta and omicron variants,  which emerged toward the end of 2020 and 2021, respectively. While these variants  appear to be no more deadly than the previous alpha, beta, and gamma strains, and  widespread population vaccinations notwithstanding, greater virulence makes the  challenge of minimizing spread even greater. One of the peculiarities of this  virus is the extreme heath impacts, with the great majority of individuals  minimally affected, even sometimes unaware of infection, while for a small  minority, it is deadly or produces diverse long-term effects. Apart from  vaccination, another approach has been an attempt to identify treatments, for  those individuals for whom the virus represents a threat of particularly severe  health impact(s). These treatments include anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies,  anticoagulant therapies, interleukin inhibitors, and anti-viral agents such as  remdesivir. Nutritional factors are also under consideration, and a variety of  clinical trials are showing promise for the use of specific fatty acids, or  related compounds such as fat-soluble steroid vitamin D, to mitigate the more  lethal aspects of COVID-19 by modulating inflammation and by anti-viral effects.  Here we explore the potential protective role of fatty acids as a potential  prophylactic as well as remedial treatment during viral infections, particularly  COVID-19. We present a multiplexed method for the analysis of free and  phospholipid bound fatty acids, which may facilitate research into the role of  fatty acids as plasma biomarkers and therapeutic agents in minimizing pre- and  post-infection health impacts.

AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has created enormous health crisis in India due to limited available treatments. Majority of the physicians use sepsis as a prototype to  understand the pathophysiology of COVID-19 as there are similarities. Heat-killed  Mycobacterium w (Mw) (Inj. Mw®) is a known immunomodulator, which is approved for  the treatment of gram-negative sepsis. This observational study was aimed to  evaluate the role of Mw along with standard of care (SOC) in critically ill  COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Total 448 patients' data (intervention group: 298 in  Mw plus SOC vs 150 in SOC alone) with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain  reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed critically ill COVID-19 patients who were admitted at  five tertiary care centers were evaluated. They were observed for changes in  laboratory [C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase  (LDH), and interleukin-6 (IL-6)] parameters, hospital stay, intensive care unit  (ICU) stay, and discharge status after giving 0.3 mL intradermal Mw for 3  consecutive days along with SOC during hospitalization. Standard of care included  injectable steroids, remdesivir, and heparin. Data were analyzed using STATA 14.2  (StataCorp., College Station, Texas, USA). RESULTS: In baseline characteristics,  Mw plus SOC arm had more critically ill patients as seen by higher  high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) score, higher lab values [CRP,  ferritin, D-dimer, LDH, creatinine, alanine aminotransferase (ALT)], and more  oxygen requirement as compared to SOC alone. Mycobacterium w arm had  significantly higher mortality rate in ICU and hospital. Both hospital stay and  ICU stay were longer in Mw arm. However, subgroup analysis found that early  initiation of Mw (&lt;3 days vs &gt;3 days) was associated with significantly  lesser odds of mortality and lesser odds of intubation requirement. Early  initiation of Mw (&lt;3 days vs &gt;3 days) also resulted in significantly lesser  duration of stay in the ICU along with reduction of CRP, D-dimer, and LDH.  Moreover, further analysis of early initiation of Mw (&lt;3 days vs control)  resulted in significant reduction in lab values (procalcitonin, CRP, ferritin,  LDH, and D-dimer). CONCLUSION: Mw when added to SOC was found to associate with  significantly increased risk of mortality and increased length of hospital stay.  However, time since admission to administration of Mw was a significant predictor  of in-ICU deaths in multivariate analysis. Early initiation of Mw (&lt;3 days)  was observed to be a protective factor against ICU deaths from the multivariate  logistic regression model. However, large randomized controlled trials are  required to support the same.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is still challenging healthcare systems and  societies worldwide. While vaccines are available, therapeutic strategies are  developing and need to be adapted to each patient. Many clinical approaches focus  on the repurposing of approved therapeutics against other diseases. However, the  efficacy of these compounds on viral infection or even harmful secondary effects  in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection are sparsely investigated. Similarly,  adverse effects of commonly used therapeutics against lifestyle diseases have not  been studied in detail. Using mono cell culture systems and a more complex chip  model, we investigated the effects of the acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) salt  D,L-lysine-acetylsalicylate + glycine (LASAG) on SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro.  ASA is commonly known as Aspirin(®) and is one of the most frequently used  medications worldwide. Our data indicate an inhibitory effect of LASAG on  SARS-CoV-2 replication and SARS-CoV-2-induced expression of pro-inflammatory  cytokines and coagulation factors. Remarkably, our data point to an additive  effect of the combination of LASAG and the antiviral acting drug remdesivir on  SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro.

AB  - We described the case of a patient affected by activated PI3K-kinase delta syndrome (APDS) and a long-lasting and pauci-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection,  treated with multiple therapeutic agents including remdesivir and  SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. We detected the clearance of the  virus 105 days from the first positive swab and 7 days after monoclonal antibody  administration. At genotyping, the SARS-CoV-2 virus resulted as wild type on all  samples tested. This case shows the monoclonal antibodies' good tolerability and  efficacy in reducing viral shedding in long-lasting infections refractory to  other treatments.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a global pandemic with a high mortality and morbidity rate worldwide. The COVID-19 vaccines that are  currently in development or already approved are expected to provide at least  some protection against the emerging variants of the virus, but the mutations may  reduce the efficacy of the existing vaccines. Purified phytochemicals from  medicinal plants provide a helpful framework for discovering new therapeutic  leads as they have long been employed in traditional medicine to treat many  disorders. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of the study are to exploit the anti-HIV  bioactive compounds against SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)  through molecular docking studies and to evaluate the Absorption, Distribution,  Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity (ADMET) properties of potential compounds.  METHODS: Molecular docking was performed to study the interaction of ligands with  the target sites of RdRp protein (PDB: 6M71) using AutoDock Vina. The ADMET  properties of potential compounds were predicted using the pkCSM platform.  RESULTS: A total of 151 phytochemicals derived from the medicinal plants with  recognized antiviral activity and 18 anti-HIV drugs were virtually screened  against COVID-19 viral RdRp to identify putative inhibitors that facilitate the  development of potential anti-COVID-19 drug candidates. The computational studies  identified 34 compounds and three drugs inhibiting viral RdRp with binding  energies ranging from -10.2 to -8.5 kcal/mol. Among them, five compounds, namely  Michellamine B, Quercetin 3-O-(2'',6''-digalloyl)-beta-Dgalactopyranoside,  Corilagin, Hypericin, and 1,2,3,4,6-Penta-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucose residues,  bound efficiently with the binding site of RdRp. Besides, Lopinavir, Maraviroc,  and Remdesivir drugs also inhibited SARS-CoV-2 polymerase. In addition, the ADMET  properties of top potential compounds were also predicted in comparison to the  drugs. CONCLUSION: The present study suggested that these potential drug  candidates can be further subjected to in vitro and in vivo studies that may help  develop effective anti-COVID-19 drugs.

AB  - Remdesivir is one of the effective drugs proposed for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the study on inhalable regimen is  currently limited though COVID-19 is respiratory diseases and infects lung area.  This work aims to prepare inhalable remdesivir formulations and verify their  effectiveness through in vitro evaluations. Formulations containing different  ratios of jet-milled inhalable remdesivir (5, 10, 20,40, and 70%) with excipients  were produced and characterized in terms of the particle size distribution,  particle morphology, flowability, water content, crystallinity, the water  sorption and desorption capabilities, and the aerodynamic performance. Results  indicating that drug loading are a vital factor in facilitating the dispersion of  remdesivir dry powder, and the ternary excipient plays a negligible role in  improving aerosol performance. Besides, the 70% remdesivir with lactose carrier  (70% RD-Lac) was physically stable and retain high aerosol performance after  conditioned at 40 °C and 75% RH for a month. Therefore, formulation 70% RD-Lac  might be recommended as a candidate product for the potential treatment of  COVID-19.

AB  - Corticosteroids lower mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia requiring oxygen support. In this observational retrospective study (September  2020-June 2021), we explored the association between receiving home  corticosteroids without oxygen supply and 30-day mortality in hospitalized  patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Among a total of 794 COVID-19 pneumonia  patients, 763 were included into the study (males 68%; mean age 65 ±12 years), of  whom 197 (26%) received home corticosteroids (mean daily prednisone  equivalent-dose 40 mg ± 12 mg; range 10-50 mg; median 50 mg; IQR 25-50 mg; for  4 days). The overall 30-day mortality of the study population was 12%. The risk  of death-adjusted for age, comorbidities, administration of remdesivir and  respiratory failure severity-was lower (HR 0.405; p = 0.024) in patients  receiving home corticosteroids. After stratifying the study population by age  categories, home corticosteroids were associated with an adjusted decrease in  mortality risk in patients > 77 years (HR 0.346; p = 0.040). Home corticosteroids  may lower the 30-day mortality in elderly COVID-19 patients.

AB  - Several variants of concern (VOCs) have emerged since the WIV04 strain of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first isolated in  January 2020. Due to mutations in the spike (S) protein, these VOCs have evolved  to enhance viral infectivity and immune evasion. However, whether mutations of  the other viral proteins lead to altered viral propagation and drug resistance  remains obscure. The replicon is a noninfectious viral surrogate capable of  recapitulating certain steps of the viral life cycle. Although several SARS-CoV-2  replicons have been developed, none of them were derived from emerging VOCs and  could only recapitulate viral genome replication and subgenomic RNA (sgRNA)  transcription. In this study, SARS-CoV-2 replicons derived from the WIV04 strain  and two VOCs (the Beta and Delta variants) were prepared by removing the S gene  from their genomes, while other structural genes remained untouched. These  replicons not only recapitulate viral genome replication and sgRNA transcription  but also support the assembly and release of viral-like particles, as manifested  by electron microscopic assays. Thus, the S-deletion replicon could recapitulate  virtually all the post-entry steps of the viral life cycle and provides a  versatile tool for measuring viral intracellular propagation and screening novel  antiviral drugs, including inhibitors of virion assembly and release. Through the  quantification of replicon RNA released into the supernatant, we demonstrate that  viral intracellular propagation and drug response to remdesivir have not yet  substantially changed during the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 from the WIV04 strain to  the Beta and Delta VOCs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Human seasonal coronaviruses usually cause mild upper-respiratory tract infection, but severe complications can occur in specific populations.  Research into seasonal coronaviruses is limited and robust experimental models  are largely lacking. This study aims to establish human airway organoids  (hAOs)-based systems for seasonal coronavirus infection and to demonstrate their  applications in studying virus-host interactions and therapeutic development.  METHODS: The infections of seasonal coronaviruses 229E, OC43 and NL63 in 3D  cultured hAOs with undifferentiated or differentiated phenotypes were tested. The  kinetics of virus replication and production was profiled at 33 °C and 37 °C.  Genome-wide transcriptome analysis by RNA sequencing was performed in hAOs under  various conditions. The antiviral activity of molnupiravir and remdesivir, two  approved medications for treating COVID19, was tested. FINDINGS: HAOs efficiently  support the replication and infectious virus production of seasonal coronaviruses  229E, OC43 and NL63. Interestingly, seasonal coronaviruses replicate much more  efficiently at 33 °C compared to 37 °C, resulting in over 10-fold higher levels  of viral replication. Genome-wide transcriptomic analyses revealed distinct  patterns of infection-triggered host responses at 33 °C compared to 37 °C  temperature. Treatment of molnupiravir and remdesivir dose-dependently inhibited  the replication of 229E, OC43 and NL63 in hAOs. INTERPRETATION: HAOs are capable  of modeling 229E, OC43 and NL63 infections. The intriguing finding that lower  temperature resembling that in the upper respiratory tract favors viral  replication may help to better understand the pathogenesis and transmissibility  of seasonal coronaviruses. HAOs-based innovative models shall facilitate the  research and therapeutic development against seasonal coronavirus infections.  FUNDING: This research is supported by funding of a VIDI grant (No. 91719300)  from the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research and the Dutch Cancer  Society Young Investigator Grant (10140) to Q.P., and the ZonMw COVID project  (114025011) from the Netherlands Organization for Health Research and Development  to R.R.

AB  - PURPOSE: SARS-CoV-2 infection in immunocompromised hosts is challenging, and prolonged viral shedding can be a common complication in these patients. We  describe the clinical, immunological, and virological course of a patient with  eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, who developed the status of  long-term asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carrier for more than 7 months. METHODS: Over  the study period, the patient underwent 20 RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 detection  on nasopharyngeal swabs. In addition, viral cultures and genetic investigation of  SARS-CoV-2 were performed. As for immunological assessment, serological and  specific T-cell testing was provided at different time points. RESULTS: Despite  the patient showing a deep drug-induced B and T adaptive immunity impairment, he  did not experience COVID-19 progression to severe complications, and the  infection remained asymptomatic during the follow-up period, but he was not able  to achieve viral clearance for more than 7 months. The infection was finally  cleared by SARS-CoV-2-specific monoclonal antibody treatment, after that  remdesivir and convalescent plasma failed in this scope. The genetic  investigations evidenced that the infection was sustained by multiple viral  subpopulations that had apparently evolved intra-host during the infection.  CONCLUSION: Our case suggests that people with highly impaired B- and T-cell  adaptive immunity can prevent COVID-19 progression to severe complications, but  they may not be able to clear SARS-CoV-2 infection. Immunocompromised hosts with  a long-term infection may play a role in the emergence of viral variants.

AB  - The global COVID-19 pandemic is underway. In recent weeks, several countries throughout the globe, and particularly in Europe, have experienced an exponential  increase in the number of individuals infected with COVID-19, probably induced by  a new variant of SARS-CoV-2, called the "Omicron variant." Mass vaccination  against COVID-19 continues worldwide. Are authorized mRNA vaccines effective  against the new Omicron variant? Recently, several pharmaceutical companies have  developed oral antiviral pills against SARS-CoV-2, i.e., molnupiravir and  paxlovid, that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 viral replication by acting on the RNA  polymerase of SARS-CoV. In pre-registration clinical trials, molnupiravir and  paxlovid have shown excellent clinical efficacy results, but what impact will  these new oral antiviral agents have against pandemic COVID-19? In what specific  clinical situations are they preferred over other antivirals such as remdesivir?  In this brief review, we explore these important aspects.

T2  - BMJ open
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine whether spontaneous reporting rates of myocarditis and pericarditis differed in immunocompromised patients compared with the whole  population overall, and in terms of demographics, vaccine dose and time-to-onset.  DESIGN: Systematic review of spontaneously reported data from the European  Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA), the USA and the UK. DATA SOURCES:  EudraVigilance (EU/EEA), Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS; USA) and  the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (UK) spontaneous  reporting databases were searched from date of vaccine launch to 1 December 2021.  ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Publicly available spontaneous reporting data for  'myocarditis' and 'pericarditis' from EU/EEA and USA following COVID-19 messenger  RNA vaccines. Reports with comorbidities or concurrent medication indicative of  transplantation, HIV infection or cancer ('immunocompromised' population) were  compared with each overall database population. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS:  Two researchers extracted data. Spontaneously reported events of myocarditis and  pericarditis were presented for immunocompromised populations for each data  source, stratified by age, sex, dose and time-to-onset (where available).  Seriousness of each event was determined according to the International  Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of  Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) Guideline E2A definition. Proportional  reporting ratio (PRR) was calculated. RESULTS: There were 178 reports of  myocarditis and pericarditis among immunocompromised individuals overall.  Seriousness was comparable between the immunocompromised and overall populations  in both databases. No trends in age or sex were observed among immunocompromised  individuals. Most reports followed a second vaccine dose and occurred within 14  days. The frequency of reporting was similar to the wider population (PRR=1.36  (95% CI=0.89 to 1.82) for VAERS population). CONCLUSIONS: Myocarditis and  pericarditis following COVID-19 vaccination are very rare, and benefits of  COVID-19 vaccination continue to outweigh any perceived risks. Reporting rates of  myocarditis and pericarditis were similar in immunocompromised individuals,  however defining characteristics differed compared with the whole population;  therefore, continued monitoring of adverse events following vaccination remains  vital to understand differences between population subgroups.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Old age is one of the most important risk factors for severe COVID-19. Few studies have analyzed changes in the clinical characteristics and  prognosis of COVID-19 among older adults before the availability of vaccines.  This work analyzes differences in clinical features and mortality in unvaccinated  very old adults during the first and successive COVID-19 waves in Spain. METHODS:  This nationwide, multicenter, retrospective cohort study analyzes unvaccinated  patients ≥ 80 years hospitalized for COVID-19 in 150 Spanish hospitals  (SEMI-COVID-19 Registry). Patients were classified according to whether they were  admitted in the first wave (March 1-June 30, 2020) or successive waves (July  1-December 31, 2020). The endpoint was all-cause in-hospital mortality, expressed  as the case fatality rate (CFR). RESULTS: Of the 21,461 patients hospitalized  with COVID-19, 5,953 (27.7%) were ≥ 80 years (mean age [IQR]: 85.6 [82.3-89.2]  years). Of them, 4,545 (76.3%) were admitted during the first wave and 1,408  (23.7%) during successive waves. Patients hospitalized in successive waves were  older, had a greater Charlson Comorbidity Index and dependency, less cough and  fever, and met fewer severity criteria at admission (qSOFA index, PO2/FiO2 ratio,  inflammatory parameters). Significant differences were observed in treatments  used in the first (greater use of antimalarials, lopinavir, and macrolides) and  successive waves (greater use of corticosteroids, tocilizumab and remdesivir).  In-hospital complications, especially acute respiratory distress syndrome and  pneumonia, were less frequent in patients hospitalized in successive waves,  except for heart failure. The CFR was significantly higher in the first wave  (44.1% vs. 33.3%; -10.8%; p < 0.001) and was higher among patients ≥ 95 years  (54.4% vs. 38.5%; -15.9%; p < 0.001). After adjustments to the model, the  probability of death was 33% lower in successive waves (OR: 0.67; 95% CI:  0.57-0.79). CONCLUSIONS: Mortality declined significantly between the first and  successive waves in very old unvaccinated patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in  Spain. This decline could be explained by a greater availability of hospital  resources and more effective treatments as the pandemic progressed, although  other factors such as changes in SARS-CoV-2 virulence cannot be ruled out.

AB  - We hereby introduce a sensitive fast straightforward spectrofluorometric method for the estimation of remdesivir and favipiravir. The two drugs are prescribed in  some regimens to treat COVID-19 pandemic disease, which is caused by SARS-CoV-2.  The method is based on the first derivative synchronous spectrofluorimetry  approach for the measurement of remdesivir and favipiravir. This was accomplished  at 251 nm and 335 nm respectively using the first derivative order at delta  lambda of 140 nm. A linear response with a correlation coefficient 0.9994 was  achieved between the concentration and the derivative amplitudes in the ranges of  20.0-100.0 ng ml(-1) and 40.0-100.0 ng ml(-1) for remdesivir and favipiravir,  respectively. The methods were validated for different parameters as stated by  the pharmacopeial rules and were applied successfully for estimation of the  studied drugs in their synthetic mixtures and in spiked human plasma samples. No  significant difference was observed between the proposed and comparison methods  as revealed from the analysis of data.

AB  - Immunocompromised patients are more likely to develop severe COVID-19, and exhibit high mortality. It is also hypothesized that chronic infection in these  patients can be a risk factor for developing new variants. We describe a patient  with prolonged active infection of COVID-19 who became infected during treatment  with an anti-CD20 antibody (obinutuzumab) for follicular lymphoma. This patient  had persistent RT-PCR positivity and live virus isolation for nine months despite  treatment with remdesivir and other potential antiviral therapies. The computed  tomography image of the chest showed that the viral pneumonia repeatedly appeared  and disappeared in different lobes, as if a new infection had occurred  continuously. The patient's SARS-CoV-2 antibody titer was negative throughout the  illness, even after two doses of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine were administered in  the seventh month of infection. A combination of monoclonal antibody therapy  against COVID-19 (casirivimab and imdevimab) and antivirals resulted in negative  RT-PCR results, and the virus was no longer isolated. The patient was clinically  cured. During the 9-month active infection period, no fixed mutations in the  spike (S) protein were detected, and the in vitro susceptibility to remdesivir  was retained. Therapeutic administration of anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies  is essential in immunocompromised patients. Therefore, measures to prevent  resistance against these key drugs are urgently needed.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 is a causative agent for COVID-19 disease, initially reported from Wuhan, China. The infected patients experienced mild to severe symptoms,  resulting in several fatalities due to a weak understanding of its pathogenesis,  which is the same even to date. This cross-sectional study has been designed on  452 symptomatic mild-to-moderate and severe/critical patients to understand the  epidemiology and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with their  comorbidities and response to treatment. The mean age of the studied patients was  58 ± 14.42 years, and the overall male to female ratio was 61.7 to 38.2%,  respectively. In total, 27.3% of the patients had a history of exposure, and  11.9% had a travel history, while for 60% of patients, the source of infection  was unknown. The most prevalent signs and symptoms in ICU patients were dry  cough, myalgia, shortness of breath, gastrointestinal discomfort, and abnormal  chest X-ray (p < 0.001), along with a high percentage of hypertension (p = 0.007)  and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (p = 0.029) as leading comorbidities.  The complete blood count indicators were significantly disturbed in severe  patients, while the coagulation profile and D-dimer values were significantly  higher in mild-to-moderate (non-ICU) patients (p < 0.001). The serum creatinine  (1.22 μmol L(-1); p = 0.016) and lactate dehydrogenase (619 μmol L(-1); p <  0.001) indicators were significantly high in non-ICU patients, while raised  values of total bilirubin (0.91 μmol L(-1); p = 0.054), C-reactive protein (84.68  mg L(-1); p = 0.001), and ferritin (996.81 mg L(-1); p < 0.001) were found in ICU  patients. The drug dexamethasone was the leading prescribed and administrated  medicine to COVID-19 patients, followed by remdesivir, meropenem, heparin, and  tocilizumab, respectively. A characteristic pattern of ground glass opacities,  consolidation, and interlobular septal thickening was prominent in severely  infected patients. These findings could be used for future research, control, and  prevention of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic that has been ongoing since the beginning of 2020 has forced health care into a difficult struggle for wellness and the lives of  patients. International data and our observations show that the course of the  disease in these patients is different than in the general population. Symptoms  depend on the immunosuppression and severity of viremia. The period of viral  replication is much longer. Our observations include 4 pediatric patients post  heart transplant who became infected with the coronavirus. One patient was  infected in the hospital during perioperative period. Two others required  hospitalization because of the severity of symptoms, and 1 was treated on an  outpatient basis. The applied treatment included the reduction of  immunosuppression, low-molecular-weight heparin, amantadine or remdesivir,  steroids, and supplementation with zinc and vitamins C and D. Based on the  antigenic tests performed, we determined the period of active replication to be 3  to 8 weeks from the onset of the first symptoms.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can be more severe in infants than in older children. To date, only a few case series have reported data on  neonates with COVID-19, including mostly asymptomatic neonates who were tested  because of exposure to maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study summarises  nationwide epidemiological data, clinical characteristics, treatment and outcomes  of neonates presenting with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: Data were  prospectively collected through the Swiss Paediatric Surveillance Unit from  hospitalised neonates with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (positive  polymerase chain reaction on a respiratory sample) from 1 March 2020 to 31  September 2021. All 29 paediatric hospitals in Switzerland reported cases.  RESULTS: In total, 73 neonates were included; 7 (10%) were preterm. The median  age at presentation was 17 days (interquartile range [IQR] 11-23); 40 (55%) were  female. The majority of neonates (64, 88%) were admitted from home. Nine (12%)  had a pre-existing medical condition. Overall, the most common symptom recorded  was fever in 52 (71%), followed by rhinorrhoea or nasal congestion in 32 (44%)  and respiratory distress in 19 (26%). Twenty (27%) neonates presented with fever  without a source. Seven (10%) neonates were admitted to an intensive care unit (5  for respiratory failure and 2 for monitoring). One (1%) neonate required  inotropic support. The median length of hospital stay in term neonates was 4 days  (IQR 3-5). Two (3%) were treated with corticosteroids and 1 (1%) with remdesivir.  In total, 60 (82%) neonates had contact with a known or suspected SARS-CoV-2  index case. All of the 71 neonates for whom data were available were discharged  to their homes without symptoms. CONCLUSION: In neonates, COVID-19 mainly  presents with fever, and symptoms of upper and lower respiratory tract infection.  The clinical course is mostly mild, requiring a short period of hospitalisation.  COVID-19 needs to be added as a differential diagnosis in neonates who present  with fever without a source. However, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 should not deter  from the search for a serious bacterial infection. Further data from surveillance  studies are needed to better understand COVID-19 in neonates, guide therapy and  to evaluate whether the clinical spectrum is changing with new SARS-CoV-2  variants.

AB  - Remdesivir is the first drug approved for treatment of COVID-19 but current evidence for recommending its use for the treatment of moderate-to-severe disease  is still controversial among clinical guidelines. We performed a nationwide,  registry-based study including all Italian hospitalized patients with COVID-19  treated with remdesivir to assess the impact of major confounders on crude 15-day  and 29-day mortality. Mortality was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier estimator  and the Cox proportional-hazards model was applied to analyze the risks by  patient's baseline features. In total, 16,462 patients treated with remdesivir  from 29 October 2020 to 17 December 2020 were entered in the study. Crude 15-day  and 29-day mortality were 7.1% (95% CI, 6.7-7.5%) and 11.7% (95% CI, 11.2-12.2%),  respectively. Being treated within two days of admission reduced the risk of  death by about 40% (HR 1.4, 95% CI, 1.2-1.6). Results from the largest cohort of  remdesivir-treated patients suggests that mortality in SARS-CoV-2 hospitalized  patients is substantially influenced by the days between SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis and  drug prescription. Current recommendations and future clinical trials for  remdesivir alone or in combination should carefully consider the target  population and timing for best efficacy of treatment.

AB  - Measles virus (MV) is a highly contagious respiratory virus responsible for outbreaks associated with significant morbidity and mortality among children and  young adults. Although safe and effective measles vaccines are available, the  COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in vaccination coverage gaps that may lead to the  resurgence of measles when restrictions are lifted. This puts individuals who  cannot be vaccinated, such as young infants and immunocompromised individuals, at  risk. Therapeutic interventions are complicated by the long incubation time of  measles, resulting in a narrow treatment window. At present, the only available  WHO-advised option is treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins, although this  is not approved as standard of care. Antivirals against measles may contribute to  intervention strategies to limit the impact of future outbreaks. Here, we review  previously described antivirals and antiviral assays, evaluate the antiviral  efficacy of a number of compounds to inhibit MV dissemination in vitro, and  discuss potential application in specific target populations. We conclude that  broadly reactive antivirals could strengthen existing intervention strategies to  limit the impact of measles outbreaks.

AB  - Remdesivir and molnupiravir have gained considerable interest because of their demonstrated activity against SARS-CoV-2. These antivirals are converted  intracellularly to their active triphosphate forms remdesivir-TP and  molnupiravir-TP. Cellular hydrolysis of these active metabolites would  consequently decrease the efficiency of these drugs; however, whether endogenous  enzymes that can catalyze this hydrolysis exist is unknown. Here, we tested  remdesivir-TP as a substrate against a panel of human hydrolases and found that  only Nudix hydrolase (NUDT) 18 catalyzed the hydrolysis of remdesivir-TP with  notable activity. The k(cat)/K(m) value of NUDT18 for remdesivir-TP was  determined to be 17,700 s(-1)M(-1), suggesting that NUDT18-catalyzed hydrolysis  of remdesivir-TP may occur in cells. Moreover, we demonstrate that the  triphosphates of the antivirals ribavirin and molnupiravir are also hydrolyzed by  NUDT18, albeit with lower efficiency than Remdesivir-TP. Low activity was also  observed with the triphosphate forms of sofosbuvir and aciclovir. This is the  first report showing that NUDT18 hydrolyzes triphosphates of nucleoside analogs  of exogenous origin, suggesting that NUDT18 can act as a cellular sanitizer of  modified nucleotides and may influence the antiviral efficacy of remdesivir,  molnupiravir, and ribavirin. As NUDT18 is expressed in respiratory epithelial  cells, it may limit the antiviral efficacy of remdesivir and molnupiravir against  SARS-CoV-2 replication by decreasing the intracellular concentration of their  active metabolites at their intended site of action.

AB  - The two RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors remdesivir and favipiravir were originally developed and approved as broad-spectrum antiviral drugs for the  treatment of harmful viral infections such as Ebola and influenza. With the  outbreak of the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the two drugs were repurposed for the  treatment of COVID-19 patients. Clinical studies suggested that the efficacy of  the drugs is enhanced in the case of an early or even prophylactic application.  Because the contact between drug molecules and the plasma membrane is essential  for a successful permeation process of the substances and therefore for their  intracellular efficiency, drug-induced effects on the membrane structure are  likely and have already been shown for other substances. We investigated the  impact of remdesivir and favipiravir on lipid bilayers in model and cell  membranes via several biophysical approaches. The measurements revealed that the  embedding of remdesivir molecules in the lipid bilayer results in a disturbance  of the membrane structure of the tested phospholipid vesicles. Nevertheless, in a  cell-based assay, the presence of remdesivir induced only weak hemolysis of the  treated erythrocytes. In contrast, no experimental indication for an effect on  the structure and integrity of the membrane was detected in the case of  favipiravir. Regarding potential prophylactic or accompanying use of the drugs in  the therapy of COVID-19, the physiologically relevant impacts associated with the  drug-induced structural modifications of the membrane might be important to  understand side effects and/or low effectivities.

V166L remained the only Nsp12 substitution after 17  passages (10 μM remdesivir), conferring a 2.3-fold increase in 50% effective  concentration (EC(50)). When V166L was introduced into a recombinant SARS-CoV-2  virus, a 1.5-fold increase in EC(50) was observed, indicating a high in vitro  barrier to remdesivir resistance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The viral kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 has been considered clinically important. While remdesivir and corticosteroids are recommended for COVID-19  patients requiring oxygen support, there is a limited number of published reports  on viral kinetics in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 treated with remdesivir  or corticosteroids. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study by collecting  longitudinal samples from the nasopharynx/throat of 123 hospitalised patients  (median age 55 years, 74% male) with COVID-19, to evaluate the effects of  remdesivir and corticosteroid treatment on viral RNA levels. The subjects were  divided into four groups: those receiving remdesivir (n = 25), betamethasone  (n = 41), both (n = 15), or neither (n = 42). Time to viral RNA clearance was  analysed using Kaplan-Meier plots, categorical data were analysed using Fisher's  exact test, and Kruskal-Wallis for continuous data. Viral RNA decline rate was  analysed using a mixed effect model. RESULTS: We found no significant difference  in SARS-CoV-2 RNA decline rate or time to SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance between the  groups. Moreover, clinical status at baseline was not correlated with time to  viral clearance. CONCLUSIONS: Since SARS-CoV-2 RNA kinetics was not affected by  treatment, repeated sampling from the upper respiratory tract cannot be used to  evaluate treatment response.

AB  - Critical respiratory manifestations of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) are rare in children, and little is known about how  immunocompromised children respond to the infection. We report a case of a  4-year-old boy with activated PI3K delta syndrome type 2 (APDS2) with a  protracted and severe COVID-19 course with both inflammatory and acute  respiratory features. He was treated with remdesivir, nitazoxanide, high-dose  corticosteroids, and tocilizumab and made a full recovery. We propose that  remdesivir may be used in combination with nitazoxanide to improve viral  clearance and reduce the chance of resistance in treating acute SARS-CoV-2  infection.

AB  - PURPOSE: Remdesivir is the first line hospital treatment of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Despite its widespread use during COVID-19 pandemic, a limited number  of data, also conflicting, are available about the frequency of cardiological  side-effects. Additionally, identification of patients who belong to the risk  groups for cardiovascular complications of antiviral treatment is difficult. CASE  DESCRIPTION: Case description We present a case of a 26 year old patient, a  soldier with COVID-19 and no comorbidities, who developed marked sinus  bradycardia during remdesivir therapy. The bradycardia resolved few days after  the end of antiviral treatment. CONCLUSION: Our case emphasizes the key  importance of the correct monitoring of patients receiving remdesivir, even those  who do not have pre-existing heart conditions.

AB  - The goal of this study was to analyze the effect of COVID-19 drugs and biologicals on hyperglycemia. A literature search with key terms, such as  "COVID-19 drugs and hyperglycemia" and "COVID-19 vaccines and hyperglycemia," was  conducted using PubMed through September 2021. The CDC data were referenced for  current COVID-19 profile and statistics. The NIH COVID-19 guidelines were  referenced for updated treatment recommendations. Micromedex and UpToDate were  used for drug and disease information. Current results suggested that  corticosteroids (dexamethasone), remdesivir and antivirals (lopinavir and  ritonavir) all have the potential to significantly raise blood glucose levels  putting patients at elevated risk for severe complications. In contrary,  hydroxychloroquine is associated with hypoglycemia, and tocilizumab decreases  inflammation which is associated with improving glucose levels. Other  anti-cytokine bioactive molecules are correlated with lower blood glucose in  patients with and without diabetes mellitus. Ivermectin, used for mild COVID-19  disease, possesses the potential for lowering blood glucose. Covishield,  Pfizer-BioNTech, and Moderna have all been associated with hyperglycemia after  the first dose. Individualized /personalized patient care is required for  diabetic mellitus patients with COVID-19 infection. Improper drug therapy  aggravates hyperglycemic conditions and other comorbid conditions, leading to  increased morbidity and mortality.

T2  - The Cochrane database of systematic reviews
AB  - BACKGROUND: With potential antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties, Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors represent a potential treatment for symptomatic severe  acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. They may  modulate the exuberant immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, a  direct antiviral effect has been described. An understanding of the current  evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of JAK inhibitors as a treatment for  coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is required. OBJECTIVES: To assess the  effects of systemic JAK inhibitors plus standard of care compared to standard of  care alone (plus/minus placebo) on clinical outcomes in individuals (outpatient  or in-hospital) with any severity of COVID-19, and to maintain the currency of  the evidence using a living systematic review approach. SEARCH METHODS: We  searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register (comprising MEDLINE, Embase,  ClinicalTrials.gov, World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials  Registry Platform, medRxiv, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials),  Web of Science, WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease, and the US  Department of Veterans Affairs Evidence Synthesis Program (VA ESP) Covid-19  Evidence Reviews to identify studies up to February 2022. We monitor newly  published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) weekly using the Cochrane COVID-19  Study Register, and have incorporated all new trials from this source until the  first week of April 2022. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included RCTs that compared  systemic JAK inhibitors plus standard of care to standard of care alone  (plus/minus placebo) for the treatment of individuals with COVID-19. We used the  WHO definitions of illness severity for COVID-19. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS:  We assessed risk of bias of primary outcomes using Cochrane's Risk of Bias 2 (RoB  2) tool. We used GRADE to rate the certainty of evidence for the following  primary outcomes: all-cause mortality (up to day 28), all-cause mortality (up to  day 60), improvement in clinical status: alive and without need for in-hospital  medical care (up to day 28), worsening of clinical status: new need for invasive  mechanical ventilation or death (up to day 28), adverse events (any grade),  serious adverse events, secondary infections. MAIN RESULTS: We included six RCTs  with 11,145 participants investigating systemic JAK inhibitors plus standard of  care compared to standard of care alone (plus/minus placebo). Standard of care  followed local protocols and included the application of glucocorticoids (five  studies reported their use in a range of 70% to 95% of their participants; one  study restricted glucocorticoid use to non-COVID-19 specific indications),  antibiotic agents, anticoagulants, and antiviral agents, as well as  non-pharmaceutical procedures. At study entry, about 65% of participants required  low-flow oxygen, about 23% required high-flow oxygen or non-invasive ventilation,  about 8% did not need any respiratory support, and only about 4% were intubated.  We also identified 13 ongoing studies, and 9 studies that are completed or  terminated and where classification is pending. Individuals with moderate to  severe disease Four studies investigated the single agent baricitinib (10,815  participants), one tofacitinib (289 participants), and one ruxolitinib (41  participants). Systemic JAK inhibitors probably decrease all-cause mortality at  up to day 28 (95 of 1000 participants in the intervention group versus 131 of  1000 participants in the control group; risk ratio (RR) 0.72, 95% confidence  interval (CI) 0.57 to 0.91; 6 studies, 11,145 participants; moderate-certainty  evidence), and decrease all-cause mortality at up to day 60 (125 of 1000  participants in the intervention group versus 181 of 1000 participants in the  control group; RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.86; 2 studies, 1626 participants;  high-certainty evidence). Systemic JAK inhibitors probably make little or no  difference in improvement in clinical status (discharged alive or hospitalised,  but no longer requiring ongoing medical care) (801 of 1000 participants in the  intervention group versus 778 of 1000 participants in the control group; RR 1.03,  95% CI 1.00 to 1.06; 4 studies, 10,802 participants; moderate-certainty  evidence). They probably decrease the risk of worsening of clinical status (new  need for invasive mechanical ventilation or death at day 28) (154 of 1000  participants in the intervention group versus 172 of 1000 participants in the  control group; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.98; 2 studies, 9417 participants;  moderate-certainty evidence). Systemic JAK inhibitors probably make little or no  difference in the rate of adverse events (any grade) (427 of 1000 participants in  the intervention group versus 441 of 1000 participants in the control group; RR  0.97, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.08; 3 studies, 1885 participants; moderate-certainty  evidence), and probably decrease the occurrence of serious adverse events (160 of  1000 participants in the intervention group versus 202 of 1000 participants in  the control group; RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.92; 4 studies, 2901 participants;  moderate-certainty evidence). JAK inhibitors may make little or no difference to  the rate of secondary infection (111 of 1000 participants in the intervention  group versus 113 of 1000 participants in the control group; RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.89  to 1.09; 4 studies, 10,041 participants; low-certainty evidence). Subgroup  analysis by severity of COVID-19 disease or type of JAK inhibitor did not  identify specific subgroups which benefit more or less from systemic JAK  inhibitors. Individuals with asymptomatic or mild disease We did not identify any  trial for this population. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In hospitalised individuals with  moderate to severe COVID-19, moderate-certainty evidence shows that systemic JAK  inhibitors probably decrease all-cause mortality. Baricitinib was the most often  evaluated JAK inhibitor. Moderate-certainty evidence suggests that they probably  make little or no difference in improvement in clinical status.  Moderate-certainty evidence indicates that systemic JAK inhibitors probably  decrease the risk of worsening of clinical status and make little or no  difference in the rate of adverse events of any grade, whilst they probably  decrease the occurrence of serious adverse events. Based on low-certainty  evidence, JAK inhibitors may make little or no difference in the rate of  secondary infection. Subgroup analysis by severity of COVID-19 or type of agent  failed to identify specific subgroups which benefit more or less from systemic  JAK inhibitors. Currently, there is no evidence on the efficacy and safety of  systemic JAK inhibitors for individuals with asymptomatic or mild disease  (non-hospitalised individuals).

AB  - With the ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), there is an urgent need to accelerate the traditional drug development process. Many  studies identified potential COVID-19 therapies based on promising nonclinical  data. However, the poor translatability from nonclinical to clinical settings has  led to failures of many of these drug candidates in the clinical phase. In this  study, we propose a mechanism-based, quantitative framework to translate  nonclinical findings to clinical outcome. Adopting a modularized approach, this  framework includes an in silico disease model for COVID-19 (virus infection and  human immune responses) and a pharmacological component for COVID-19 therapies.  The disease model was able to reproduce important longitudinal clinical data for  patients with mild and severe COVID-19, including viral titer, key immunological  cytokines, antibody responses, and time courses of lymphopenia. Using remdesivir  as a proof-of-concept example of model development for the pharmacological  component, we developed a pharmacological model that describes the conversion of  intravenously administered remdesivir as a prodrug to its active metabolite  nucleoside triphosphate through intracellular metabolism and connected it to the  COVID-19 disease model. After being calibrated with the placebo arm data, our  model was independently and quantitatively able to predict the primary endpoint  (time to recovery) of the remdesivir clinical study, Adaptive Covid-19 Clinical  Trial (ACTT). Our work demonstrates the possibility of quantitatively predicting  clinical outcome based on nonclinical data and mechanistic understanding of the  disease and provides a modularized framework to aid in candidate drug selection  and clinical trial design for COVID-19 therapeutics.

AB  - Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been on the agenda of humanity for more than 2 years. In the meantime, the pandemic has caused economic  shutdowns, halt of daily lives and global mobility, overcrowding of the  healthcare systems, panic, and worse, more than 6 million deaths. Today, there is  still no specific therapy for COVID-19. Research focuses on repurposing of  antiviral drugs that are licensed or currently in the research phase, with a  known systemic safety profile. However, local safety profile should also be  evaluated depending on the new indication, administration route and dosage form.  Additionally, various vaccines have been developed. But the causative virus,  Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has undergone  multiple variations, too. The premise that vaccines may suffice to eradicate new  and all variants is unreliable, as they are based on earlier versions of the  virus. Therefore, a specific medication therapy for COVID-19 is crucial and  needed in order to prevent severe complications of the disease. Even though there  is no specific drug that inhibits the replication of the disease-causing virus,  among the current treatment options, systemic antivirals are the most medically  appropriate. As SARS-CoV-2 directly targets the lungs and initiates lung damage,  treating COVID-19 with inhalants can offer many advantages over the  enteral/parenteral administration. Inhaled drug delivery provides higher drug  concentration, specifically in the pulmonary system. This enables the reduction  of systemic side effects and produces a rapid clinical response. In this article,  the most frequently (systemically) used antiviral compounds are reviewed  including Remdesivir, Favipiravir, Molnupiravir, Lopinavir-Ritonavir, Umifenovir,  Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine and Heparin. A comprehensive literature search  was conducted to provide insight into the potential inhaled use of these  antiviral drugs and the current studies on inhalation therapy for COVID-19 was  presented. A brief evaluation was also made on the use of inhaler devices in the  treatment of COVID-19. Inhaled antivirals paired with suitable inhaler devices  should be considered for COVID-19 treatment options.

AB  - This network meta-analysis (NMA) assessed the efficacy of remdesivir in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen. Randomized  controlled trials of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, where patients were  receiving supplemental oxygen at baseline and at least one arm received treatment  with remdesivir, were identified. Outcomes included mortality, recovery, and no  longer requiring supplemental oxygen. NMAs were performed for low-flow oxygen  (LFO(2)); high-flow oxygen (HFO(2)), including NIV (non-invasive ventilation); or  oxygen at any flow (AnyO(2)) at early (day 14/15) and late (day 28/29) time  points. Six studies were included (N = 5245 patients) in the NMA. Remdesivir  lowered early and late mortality among AnyO(2) patients (risk ratio (RR) 0.52,  95% credible interval (CrI) 0.34-0.79; RR 0.81, 95%CrI 0.69-0.95) and LFO(2)  patients (RR 0.21, 95%CrI 0.09-0.46; RR 0.24, 95%CrI 0.11-0.48); no improvement  was observed among HFO(2) patients. Improved early and late recovery was observed  among LFO(2) patients (RR 1.22, 95%CrI 1.09-1.38; RR 1.17, 95%CrI 1.09-1.28).  Remdesivir also lowered the requirement for oxygen support among all patient  subgroups. Among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 requiring supplemental  oxygen at baseline, use of remdesivir compared to best supportive care is likely  to improve the risk of mortality, recovery and need for oxygen support in AnyO(2)  and LFO(2) patients.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2-infected subjects are generally asymptomatic during initial viral replication but may suffer severe immunopathology after the virus has receded and  monocytes have infiltrated the airways. In bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from  severe COVID-19 patients, monocytes express mRNA encoding inflammatory mediators  and contain SARS-CoV-2 transcripts. We leverage a human small airway model of  infection and inflammation, whereby primary blood monocytes transmigrate across  SARS-CoV-2-infected lung epithelium to characterize viral burden, gene  expression, and inflammatory mediator secretion by epithelial cells and  monocytes. In this model, lung-infiltrating monocytes acquire SARS-CoV-2 from the  epithelium and upregulate expression and secretion of inflammatory mediators,  mirroring in vivo data. Combined use of baricitinib (Janus kinase inhibitor) and  remdesivir (nucleoside analog) enhances antiviral signaling and viral clearance  by SARS-CoV-2-positive monocytes while decreasing secretion of proneutrophilic  mediators associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome. These findings  highlight the role of lung-infiltrating monocytes in COVID-19 pathogenesis and  their importance as a therapeutic target.

AB  - Remdesivir is the first US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We conducted a  retrospective pharmacogenetic study to examine remdesivir-associated liver enzyme  elevation among Million Veteran Program participants hospitalized with COVID-19  between March 15, 2020, and June 30, 2021. Pharmacogene phenotypes were assigned  using Stargazer. Linear regression was performed on peak log-transformed enzyme  values, stratified by population, adjusted for age, sex, baseline liver enzymes,  comorbidities, and 10 population-specific principal components. Patients on  remdesivir had higher peak alanine aminotransferase (ALT) values following  treatment initiation compared with patients not receiving remdesivir. Remdesivir  administration was associated with a 33% and 24% higher peak ALT in non-Hispanic  White (NHW) and non-Hispanic Black (NHB) participants (p < 0.001), respectively.  In a multivariable model, NHW CYP2C19 intermediate/poor metabolizers had a 9%  increased peak ALT compared with NHW normal/rapid/ultrarapid metabolizers  (p = 0.015); this association was not observed in NHB participants. In summary,  remdesivir-associated ALT elevations appear to be multifactorial, and further  studies are needed.

AB  - A 55-year-old man was admitted to a hospital in Northeast India with fever, cough and breathlessness and was diagnosed with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. He was a  known case of seropositive, erosive rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and was taking  disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). The patient was treated with  remdesivir, heparin and a short course of corticosteroids for COVID-19 pneumonia.  With the improvement of COVID-19 pneumonia, the patient also noticed a marked  improvement in his joint symptoms despite not taking any DMARDs for RA. The  temporal relationship between the time of disappearance of all signs and symptoms  of RA within a few days after COVID-19 pneumonia and maintenance of RA remission  for over one year of follow up to date suggests that COVID-19 likely caused the  remission of RA. This case highlights the need for larger studies to understand  the COVID-19 effects on RA remission and their potential link if any. However,  the evidence of worse outcome with COVID-19 in immunosuppression which is common  in RA cannot be overlooked.

AB  - Bats are likely the primary source of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Minks are highly susceptible to infection by  SARS-CoV-2. Transmission from asymptomatic individuals was estimated to account  for over 50% of all transmissions of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases.  SARS-CoV-2 is evolving towards more efficient aerosol transmission. Remdesivir,  baricitinib, tocilizumab and dexamethasone are frequently used for the treatment  of patients with respiratory failure due to COVID-19. There is a rising incidence  of non-tuberculous Mycobacterium pulmonary disease globally, with a higher  prevalence in Asian countries than in the Western world. Protracted bacterial  bronchitis is a common cause of chronic productive cough in childhood.  Re-emergence of respiratory syncytial virus may occur after the relaxation of  infection control measures and the reopening of borders during COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was originally identified in Wuhan city of China in December 2019 and it spread rapidly throughout the globe,  causing a threat to human life. Since targeted therapies are deficient,  scientists all over the world have an opportunity to develop novel drug therapies  to combat COVID-19. After the declaration of a global medical emergency, it was  established that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) could permit the use of  emergency testing, treatments, and vaccines to decrease suffering, and loss of  life, and restore the nation's health and security. The FDA has approved the use  of remdesivir and its analogs as an antiviral medication, to treat COVID-19. The  primary protease of SARS-CoV-2, which has the potential to regulate coronavirus  proliferation, has been a viable target for the discovery of medicines against  SARS-CoV-2. The present research deals with the in silico technique to screen  phytocompounds from a traditional medicinal plant, Bauhinia variegata for  potential inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease. Dried leaves of the plant  B. variegata were used to prepare aqueous and methanol extract and the  constituents were analyzed using the GC-MS technique. A total of 57 compounds  were retrieved from the aqueous and methanol extract analysis. Among these, three  lead compounds (2,5 dimethyl 1-H Pyrrole, 2,3 diphenyl cyclopropyl methyl phenyl  sulphoxide, and Benzonitrile m phenethyl) were shown to have the highest binding  affinity (-5.719 to -5.580 kcal/mol) towards SARS-CoV-2 M(pro). The post MD  simulation results also revealed the favorable confirmation and stability of the  selected lead compounds with M(pro) as per trajectory analysis. The Prime MM/GBSA  binding free energy supports this finding, the top lead compound 2,3 diphenyl  cyclopropyl methyl phenyl sulphoxide showed high binding free energy  (-64.377 ± 5.24 kcal/mol) towards M(pro) which reflects the binding stability of  the molecule with M(pro). The binding free energy of the complexes was strongly  influenced by His, Gln, and Glu residues. All of the molecules chosen are found  to have strong pharmacokinetic characteristics and show drug-likeness properties.  The lead compounds present acute toxicity (LD50) values ranging from 670 mg/kg to  2500 mg/kg; with toxicity classifications of 4 and 5 classes. Thus, these  compounds could behave as probable lead candidates for treatment against  SARS-CoV-2. However further in vitro and in vivo studies are required for the  development of medication against SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Objective The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to spread across the world, and the utility of many drugs for treatment has been suggested.  However, few studies have examined the efficacy and safety of treatment with  baricitinib, remdesivir, and dexamethasone. Methods A retrospective, cohort study  of patients who were admitted to Kurashiki Central Hospital in Japan between  April 6 and June 29, 2021, was conducted. Differences in patients' background  characteristics, clinical outcomes, and safety were investigated in the groups  with and without baricitinib treatment. The primary outcome was the bacterial  infection rate, and the secondary outcome was the 28-day mortality rate. An  inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) analysis, including 12  covariates, was used as a propensity score analysis to reduce biases. Results In  total, there were 96 patients, including 43 in the baricitinib-containing therapy  (BCT) group and 53 in the non-baricitinib-containing therapy (non-BCT) group. In  the BCT group, the ordinal scale on admission was 2.3% with 4, 51.1% with 5,  23.3% with 6, and 23.3% with 7. In the non-BCT group, the ordinal scale was 1.9%  with 3, 18.9% with 4, 58.5% with 5, 13.2% with 6, and 7.5% with 7. After  adjusting by the IPTW analysis, the BCT group did not have an increased bacterial  infection rate [odds ratio (OR), 1.1; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.36-3.38;  p=0.87] or 28-day mortality rate (OR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.07-1.3; p=0.11) compared  with the non-BCT group. Conclusion BCT can be administered without increasing the  infection risk compared with non-BCT.

AB  - A patient with follicular lymphoma treated with obinutuzumab and bendamustine experienced prolonged coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). One month after the  symptoms transiently improved, the patient experienced exacerbated COVID-19  symptoms. The patient recovered from COVID-19 with remdesivir and dexamethasone  and was discharged 77 days after the disease onset. The patient completed a  primary series of SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations on day 176, but the anti-spike protein  IgG was not detected later. A careful observation to detect any subsequent  relapse of COVID-19 symptoms is necessary in immunocompromised patients.  Chemotherapy should be based on the disease status and type of lymphoma.

AB  - COVID-19 readmissions are associated with increased patient mortality and healthcare system strain. This retrospective cohort study of PCR-confirmed  COVID-19 positive adults (>18 years) hospitalized and readmitted within 30 days  of discharge from index admission was performed at eight Atlanta hospitals from  March to December 2020. The objective was to describe COVID-19 patient-level  demographics and clinical characteristics, and community-level social  determinants of health (SDoH) that contribute to 30-day readmissions.  Demographics, comorbidities, COVID-19 treatment, and discharge disposition data  were extracted from the index admission. ZIP codes were linked to a  demographic/lifestyle database interpolating to community-level SDoH. Of 7155  patients with COVID-19, 463 (6.5%) had 30-day, unplanned, all-cause hospital  readmissions. Statistically significant differences were not found in  readmissions stratified by age, sex, race, or ethnicity. Patients with a  high-risk Charlson Comorbidity Index had higher odds of readmission (OR 4.8 (95%  CI: 2.1 to 11.0)). Remdesivir treatment and intensive care unit (ICU) care were  associated with lower odds of readmission (OR 0.5 (95% CI: 0.4 to 0.8) and OR 0.5  (95% CI: 0.4 to 0.7), respectively). Patients residing in communities with larger  average household size were less likely to be readmitted (OR 0.7 (95% CI: 0.5 to  0.9). In this cohort, patients who received remdesivir, were cared for in an ICU,  and resided in ZIP codes with higher proportions of residents with increased  social support had lower odds of readmission. These patient-level factors and  community-level SDoH may be used to identify patients with COVID-19 who are at  increased risk of readmission.

AB  - The objective of this study was to describe the population pharmacokinetics of remdesivir and GS-441524 in hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)  patients. A prospective observational pharmacokinetic study was performed in  non-critically ill hospitalized COVID-19 patients with hypoxemia. For evaluation  of the plasma concentrations of remdesivir and its metabolite GS-441524, samples  were collected on the first day of therapy. A nonlinear mixed-effects model was  developed to describe the pharmacokinetics and identify potential covariates that  explain variability. Alternative dosing regimens were evaluated using Monte Carlo  simulations. Seventeen patients were included. Remdesivir and GS-441524  pharmacokinetics were best described by a one-compartment model. The estimated  glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) on GS-441524 clearance was identified as a  clinically relevant covariate. The interindividual variability in clearance and  volume of distribution for both remdesivir and GS-441524 was high (remdesivir,  38.9% and 47.9%, respectively; GS-441525, 47.4% and 42.9%, respectively). The  estimated elimination half-life for remdesivir was 0.48 h, and that for GS-441524  was 26.6 h. The probability of target attainment (PTA) of the in vitro 50%  effective concentration (EC(50)) for GS-441524 in plasma can be improved by  shortening the dose interval of remdesivir and thereby increasing the total daily  dose (PTA, 51.4% versus 94.7%). In patients with reduced renal function, the  metabolite GS-441524 accumulates. A population pharmacokinetic model for  remdesivir and GS-441524 in COVID-19 patients was developed. Remdesivir showed  highly variable pharmacokinetics. The elimination half-life of remdesivir in  COVID-19 patients is short, and the clearance of GS-441524 is dependent on the  eGFR. Alternative dosing regimens aimed at optimizing the remdesivir and  GS-441524 concentrations may improve the effectiveness of remdesivir treatment in  COVID-19 patients.

AB  - Older age and underlying conditions such as diabetes/obesity or immunosuppression are leading host risk factors for developing severe complications from COVID-19  infection. The pathogenesis of COVID-19-related cytokine storm, tissue damage,  and fibrosis may be interconnected with fundamental aging processes, including  dysregulated immune responses and cellular senescence. Here, we examined effects  of key cytokines linked to cellular senescence on expression of SARS-CoV-2 viral  entry receptors. We found exposure of human umbilical vein endothelial cells  (HUVECs) to the inflammatory cytokines, TNF-α + IFN-γ or a cocktail of  TNF-α + IFN-γ + IL-6, increased expression of ACE2/DPP4, accentuated the  pro-inflammatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), and decreased  cellular proliferative capacity, consistent with progression towards a cellular  senescence-like state. IL-6 by itself failed to induce substantial effects on  viral entry receptors or SASP-related genes, while synergy between TNF-α and  IFN-γ initiated a positive feedback loop via hyper-activation of the JAK/STAT1  pathway, causing SASP amplification. Breaking the interactive loop between  senescence and cytokine secretion with JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib or antiviral  drug remdesivir prevented hyper-inflammation, normalized SARS-CoV-2 entry  receptor expression, and restored HUVECs proliferative capacity. This loop  appears to underlie cytokine-mediated viral entry receptor activation and links  with senescence and hyper-inflammation.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has rapidly spread and led to global health crises.  COVID-19 causes well-known respiratory failure and gastrointestinal symptoms,  such as diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. Thus, human gastrointestinal cell models  are urgently needed for COVID-19 research; however, it is difficult to obtain  primary human intestinal cells. In this study, we examined whether human induced  pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived small intestinal epithelial cells  (iPSC-SIECs) could be used as a SARS-CoV-2 infection model. We observed that  iPSC-SIECs, such as absorptive and Paneth cells, were infected with SARS-CoV-2,  and remdesivir treatment decreased intracellular SARS-CoV-2 replication in  iPSC-SIECs. SARS-CoV-2 infection decreased expression levels of tight junction  markers, ZO-3 and CLDN1, and transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), which  evaluates the integrity of tight junction dynamics. In addition, SARS-CoV-2  infection increased expression levels of proinflammatory genes, which are  elevated in patients with COVID-19. These findings suggest iPSC-SIECs as a useful  in vitro model for elucidating COVID-19 pathology and drug development.

AB  - By December 2021, the COVID-19 caused approximately 6.1 million deaths around the world. Several vaccines have been approved, but there is still a need for  non-prophylactic treatments for COVID-19. Remdesivir is an antiviral drug  approved for emergency use against COVID-19 in several countries, but one of the  first clinical trials was inconclusive about the mortality reduction, although  the drug showed a reduction in the recovery time of hospitalized patients. Thus,  the present investigation revisits the clinical evidence of using remdesivir for  COVID-19 treatment, patent status, pharmacology and chemistry. We found 184  families of patents in the Cortellis database, and concerning the clinical  evidence, we retrieved 14 systematic reviews with meta-analysis involving  remdesivir as a treatment for COVID-19, discussing the reduction of adverse  events, hospitalization days, mortality rate and the mechanical ventilation  period.

TI  - Remdesivir and Its Combination With Repurposed Drugs as COVID-19 Therapeutics.
AU  - Chatterjee, Bhaswati

T2  - Frontiers in immunology
AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 virus needs multiple copies for its multiplication using an enzyme RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Remdesivir inhibits viral RdRp, controls the  multiplication of the virus, and protects patients. However, treatment of  COVID-19 with remdesivir involves adverse effects. Many ongoing clinical trials  are exploring the potential of the combination of remdesivir with repurposed  drugs by targeting multiple targets of virus and host human simultaneously.  Better results were obtained with the remdesivir-baricitinib combination  treatment for COVID-19 compared to the treatment with remdesivir alone. Notably,  recovery from COVID-19 was found to be 8 days less via the remdesivir-baricitinib  combination treatment as compared to remdesivir treatment alone. Furthermore, the  mortality rate via the remdesivir-baricitinib combination treatment was lower  compared to the remdesivir-only treatment. Remdesivir targets the SARS-CoV-2  enzyme while baricitinib targets the host human enzyme. Simultaneously,  remdesivir and baricitinib as a combination inhibit their target viral RdRp and  human Janus kinase, respectively. Ongoing trials for the combination of drugs  will suggest in the future whether they may reduce the recovery time, reduce the  mortality rate, and improve patient clinical status for noninvasive ventilation.  In the future, simultaneously targeting virus replication enzymes and host human  kinases may be the strategy for SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a recently emerged human  coronavirus. COVID-19 vaccines have proven to be successful in protecting the  vaccinated from infection, reducing the severity of disease, and deterring the  transmission of infection. However, COVID-19 vaccination faces many challenges,  such as the decline in vaccine-induced immunity over time, and the decrease in  potency against some SARS-CoV-2 variants including the recently emerged Omicron  variant, resulting in breakthrough infections. The challenges that COVID-19  vaccination is facing highlight the importance of the discovery of antivirals to  serve as another means to tackle the pandemic. To date, neutralizing antibodies  that block viral entry by targeting the viral spike protein make up the largest  class of antivirals that has received US FDA emergency use authorization (EUA)  for COVID-19 treatment. In addition to the spike protein, other key targets for  the discovery of direct-acting antivirals include viral enzymes that are  essential for SARS-CoV-2 replication, such as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and  proteases, as judged by US FDA approval for remdesivir, and EUA for Paxlovid  (nirmatrelvir + ritonavir) for treating COVID-19 infections. This review presents  an overview of the current status and future direction of antiviral drug  discovery for treating SARS-CoV-2 infections, covering important antiviral  targets such as the viral spike protein, non-structural protein (nsp) 3  papain-like protease, nsp5 main protease, and the nsp12/nsp7/nsp8 RNA-dependent  RNA polymerase complex.

AB  - Although many efforts have been made to elucidate the pathogenesis of COVID-19, the underlying mechanisms are yet to be fully uncovered. However, it is known  that a dysfunctional immune response and the accompanying uncontrollable  inflammation lead to troublesome outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Pannexin1  channels are put forward as interesting drug targets for the treatment of  COVID-19 due to their key role in inflammation and their link to other viral  infections. In the present study, we selected a panel of drugs previously tested  in clinical trials as potential candidates for the treatment of COVID-19 early on  in the pandemic, including hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin,  dexamethasone, ribavirin, remdesivir, favipiravir, lopinavir, and ritonavir. The  effect of the drugs on pannexin1 channels was assessed at a functional level by  means of measurement of extracellular ATP release. Immunoblot analysis and  real-time quantitative reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction analysis  were used to study the potential of the drugs to alter pannexin1 protein and mRNA  expression levels, respectively. Favipiravir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, and  the combination of lopinavir with ritonavir were found to inhibit pannexin1  channel activity without affecting pannexin1 protein or mRNA levels. Thusthree  new inhibitors of pannexin1 channels were identified that, though currently not  being used anymore for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, could be potential  drug candidates for other pannexin1-related diseases.

AB  - RATIONALE: Since late 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) had rapidly spread worldwide, resulting in a pandemic. Patients with  coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have difficulty in visiting clinics in person  during pandemic because they might be encouraged to quarantine at home with  supportive care. Peritonsillar abscess rarely coexists with COVID-19; however,  patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection could get co-infections or become  superinfected with other microorganisms which could cause peritonsillar abscess.  We herein describe a case of peritonsillar abscess caused by Prevotella bivia  that occurred as a co-infection with COVID-19 during home quarantine. PATIENT  CONCERNS: A 32-year-old Asian woman who was diagnosed with COVID-19 was  instructed to stay home for quarantine. Her pharyngeal discomfort worsened, and  she experienced trismus and dysphagia. An emergent visiting doctor referred her  to our hospital. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed peritonsillar  abscess findings, following which we referred her to an ear, nose, throat  specialist. Prevotella bivia was identified on needle aspiration pus culture;  however, two sets of blood and throat cultures were negative. DIAGNOSIS: A  definitive diagnosis of acute COVID-19 and peritonsillar abscess due to  Prevotella bivia was made. INTERVENTIONS: An antibiotic drug, antiviral drug, and  adjunctive steroid were administered intravenously. OUTCOMES: Her symptoms  improved without the need for incision and drainage, and she was discharged on  day 7. CONCLUSION: Patients with suspected peritonsillar abscess should be  triaged and referred to ear, nose, throat specialists appropriately. Scoring  systems, such as modified Liverpool peritonsillar abscess score or the guidelines  criteria might be useful tools to triage patients. During the early phase of  SARS-CoV-2 infection, administration of corticosteroids is not recommended. When  adjunctive steroids are considered for peritonsillar abscess, prior to or  simultaneous use of the antiviral agent remdesivir for COVID-19 might be  recommended.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Since the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, millions of people have been infected and died. Different therapeutic approaches have been  recommended, but only a few have shown clinical advantages. Low-molecular-weight  heparin (LMWH) has been recommended to prevent COVID-19-related thrombo-embolic  events. We aimed to evaluate the impact of early treatment with LMWH on hospital  admission and death in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: We conducted  an observational monocentric retrospective study to evaluate the preventive role  of LMWH on the mortality rate of COVID-19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 infected patients  were recruited from the beginning of the Italian epidemic to March 31, 2021. We  excluded patients with missing data and those chronically exposed to LMWH.  Treatment prescription was based on international and national guidelines and  modified depending on clinical presentation and drug-drug interactions. RESULTS:  Seven hundred thirty-four SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were recruited, with 357  (48.6%) males and a median (IQR) age of 77.9 (65-85.7) years. 77.5% of people  developed SARS-CoV-2-related symptoms and 62.8% were admitted to the hospital,  and 20.2% died. Four hundred ninety-two (67%) started LMWH. In particular, 296  (40.3%) were treated within five days since symptoms onset. At logistic  regression, early LMWH therapy was associated with lower mortality. Furthermore,  remdesivir treatment showed a lower risk of death. On the contrary, age, BMI>30  kg/m(2), neurological diseases, fever or dyspnea were associated with an  increased risk of death. CONCLUSIONS: Early treatment with LMWH was associated  with lower mortality in our cohort. Further studies are needed to better assess  the role of wider LMWH administration in terms of timing and regimen dose.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. The approval of vaccines and small-molecule antivirals is vital in combating the pandemic. The  viral polymerase inhibitors remdesivir and molnupiravir and the viral main  protease inhibitor nirmatrelvir/ritonavir have been approved by the U.S. FDA.  However, the emergence of variants of concern/interest calls for additional  antivirals with novel mechanisms of action. The SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease  (PL(pro)) mediates the cleavage of viral polyprotein and modulates the host's  innate immune response upon viral infection, rendering it a promising antiviral  drug target. This Perspective highlights major achievements in structure-based  design and high-throughput screening of SARS-CoV-2 PL(pro) inhibitors since the  beginning of the pandemic. Encouraging progress includes the design of  non-covalent PL(pro) inhibitors with favorable pharmacokinetic properties and the  first-in-class covalent PL(pro) inhibitors. In addition, we offer our opinion on  the knowledge gaps that need to be filled to advance PL(pro) inhibitors to the  clinic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Baricitinib and dexamethasone have randomised trials supporting their use for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. We assessed the combination of  baricitinib plus remdesivir versus dexamethasone plus remdesivir in preventing  progression to mechanical ventilation or death in hospitalised patients with  COVID-19. METHODS: In this randomised, double-blind, double placebo-controlled  trial, patients were enrolled at 67 trial sites in the USA (60 sites), South  Korea (two sites), Mexico (two sites), Singapore (two sites), and Japan (one  site). Hospitalised adults (≥18 years) with COVID-19 who required supplemental  oxygen administered by low-flow (≤15 L/min), high-flow (>15 L/min), or  non-invasive mechanical ventilation modalities who met the study eligibility  criteria (male or non-pregnant female adults ≥18 years old with  laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection) were enrolled in the study. Patients  were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either baricitinib, remdesivir, and  placebo, or dexamethasone, remdesivir, and placebo using a permuted block design.  Randomisation was stratified by study site and baseline ordinal score at  enrolment. All patients received remdesivir (≤10 days) and either baricitinib (or  matching oral placebo) for a maximum of 14 days or dexamethasone (or matching  intravenous placebo) for a maximum of 10 days. The primary outcome was the  difference in mechanical ventilation-free survival by day 29 between the two  treatment groups in the modified intention-to-treat population. Safety analyses  were done in the as-treated population, comprising all participants who received  one dose of the study drug. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,  NCT04640168. FINDINGS: Between Dec 1, 2020, and April 13, 2021, 1047 patients  were assessed for eligibility. 1010 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned,  516 (51%) to baricitinib plus remdesivir plus placebo and 494 (49%) to  dexamethasone plus remdesivir plus placebo. The mean age of the patients was 58·3  years (SD 14·0) and 590 (58%) of 1010 patients were male. 588 (58%) of 1010  patients were White, 188 (19%) were Black, 70 (7%) were Asian, and 18 (2%) were  American Indian or Alaska Native. 347 (34%) of 1010 patients were Hispanic or  Latino. Mechanical ventilation-free survival by day 29 was similar between the  study groups (Kaplan-Meier estimates of 87·0% [95% CI 83·7 to 89·6] in the  baricitinib plus remdesivir plus placebo group and 87·6% [84·2 to 90·3] in the  dexamethasone plus remdesivir plus placebo group; risk difference 0·6 [95% CI  -3·6 to 4·8]; p=0·91). The odds ratio for improved status in the dexamethasone  plus remdesivir plus placebo group compared with the baricitinib plus remdesivir  plus placebo group was 1·01 (95% CI 0·80 to 1·27). At least one adverse event  occurred in 149 (30%) of 503 patients in the baricitinib plus remdesivir plus  placebo group and 179 (37%) of 482 patients in the dexamethasone plus remdesivir  plus placebo group (risk difference 7·5% [1·6 to 13·3]; p=0·014). 21 (4%) of 503  patients in the baricitinib plus remdesivir plus placebo group had at least one  treatment-related adverse event versus 49 (10%) of 482 patients in the  dexamethasone plus remdesivir plus placebo group (risk difference 6·0% [2·8 to  9·3]; p=0·00041). Severe or life-threatening grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred  in 143 (28%) of 503 patients in the baricitinib plus remdesivir plus placebo  group and 174 (36%) of 482 patients in the dexamethasone plus remdesivir plus  placebo group (risk difference 7·7% [1·8 to 13·4]; p=0·012). INTERPRETATION: In  hospitalised patients with COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen by low-flow,  high-flow, or non-invasive ventilation, baricitinib plus remdesivir and  dexamethasone plus remdesivir resulted in similar mechanical ventilation-free  survival by day 29, but dexamethasone was associated with significantly more  adverse events, treatment-related adverse events, and severe or life-threatening  adverse events. A more individually tailored choice of immunomodulation now  appears possible, where side-effect profile, ease of administration, cost, and  patient comorbidities can all be considered.

AB  - PURPOSE: Remdesivir is FDA-approved for treatment of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia, but not recommended in patients with severe renal failure.  This study aims to evaluate the safety of remdesivir in this patient population.  METHODS: This was a single-center, retrospective cohort study including  patients ≥ 18 years old, admitted between May 1, 2020 and April 30, 2021 who  received remdesivir. Patients were divided into two groups: estimated creatinine  clearance (eCrCl) < 30 mL/min and eCrCl ≥ 30 ml/min. Primary outcomes were  development of acute kidney injury (AKI) after remdesivir initiation and  hepatotoxicity (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] or aspartate aminotransferase  [AST] > 5 × upper limit of normal) both at end of treatment (EOT) or 5 days after  EOT. Secondary outcomes were length of stay (days) and mortality. RESULTS: 513  patients were assessed with 416 patients included in the study  (eCrCl < 30 mL/min, n = 55; eCrCl ≥ 30 mL/min n = 361). Incidence of AKI  (eCrCl < 30 mL/min 11% vs eCrCl ≥ 30 mL/min 7%, OR 1.57, 95% CI 0.57, 4.3) and  hepatotoxicity (ALT: 2% vs 4%, OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.05, 3.7 and AST: 2% vs 2%, OR  1.26, 95% CI 0.14, 11.04) were similar between the two groups. Length of stay was  longer in the eCrCl < 30 mL/min group (mean 18.6 vs 11.9, difference 6.7, 95% CI  3.8, 9.6), and no difference in mortality was observed (21.8% vs 18.8%, OR 1.2,  95% CI 0.6, 2.4). CONCLUSION: Remdesivir was not associated with development of  AKI or hepatotoxicity in patients with eCrCl < 30 mL/min compared to patients  with eCrCl ≥ 30 mL/min, and warrants further investigation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has a substantial impact on the physical and mental health status of patients with COVID-19. This study's objective was to  evaluate the factors associated with mental health in patients isolated with  COVID-19. METHODS: It is a retrospective, cross-sectional study. One hundred and  two patients discharged from COVID-19 hospitalization in Korea were analyzed. The  primary outcome was the correlation between psychological problems such as  anxiety, depression, and fear of stigma and physical symptoms such as respiratory  symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, headache, and fever. Mental and physical  symptoms were ascertained using closed and multiple-choice questions. The  secondary outcome was the correlation between mental issues, demographic factors,  and disease severity. Hypoxia and the need for oxygen therapy, a need for  remdesivir antiviral treatment, and indications of pneumonia progression on chest  x-ray were confirmed through a review of medical records and used to measure  disease severity. RESULTS: Patients with COVID-19 indicated feelings of  depression (48.1%), anxiety (49.1%), and fear of stigma (60.45%), and some  continued to experience physical symptoms even after discharge. Logistic  regression revealed that gastrointestinal symptoms positively correlated with  depression (p &lt; .05) and headache positively correlated with fear of stigma  (p &lt; .05), while the other factors were not statistically significant  (p &gt; .05). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that psychological symptoms  persisted even after discharge. Gastrointestinal symptoms and headache were  influential factors in predicting depression and fear of stigma. Based on this,  dedicated COVID-19 hospitals should provide mental health support and preventive  management.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To combine spontaneously reported data from multiple countries to estimate reporting rate, and better understand risk factors for myocarditis and  pericarditis following COVID-19 messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines. DESIGN: Systematic  review of spontaneously reported data from UK, USA and European Union/European  Economic Area (EU/EEA) and of the scientific literature. DATA SOURCES: UK Yellow  Card scheme, Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), EudraVigilance were  searched from date of vaccine launch to 14 March 2022-16 March 2022.  PubMed/MEDLINE and Embase were searched to 15 March 2022. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:  We included publicly available spontaneous reporting data for 'Myocarditis' and  'Pericarditis' from UK, USA and EU/EEA following COVID-19 mRNA vaccines.  Pharmacoepidemiological observational studies investigating  myocarditis/pericarditis following mRNA COVID-19 vaccines were included (no  restrictions on language or date). Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tools  assessed study quality. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two researchers extracted  data. Events of myocarditis and pericarditis were presented for each data source,  stratified by vaccine, age, sex and dose (where available). Reporting rates were  calculated for myocarditis and pericarditis for each population. For published  pharmacoepidemiological studies, design, participant characteristics, and study  results were tabulated. RESULTS: Overall, 18 204 myocarditis and pericarditis  events were submitted to the UK, USA and EU/EEA regulators during the study  period. Males represented 62.24% (n=11 331) of myocarditis and pericarditis  reports. In the UK and USA, most reports concerned vaccinees aged <40 years  (59.7% and 47.3% of reported events, respectively); trends in age were less clear  for EU/EEA. Reports were more frequent following a second dose (47.1% of reports,  where data available). Reporting rates were consistent between the data sources.  Thirty-two pharmacoepidemiological studies were included; results were consistent  with our spontaneous report analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Younger vaccinees more  frequently report myocarditis and pericarditis following mRNA COVID-19 vaccines  than older vaccinees. Results from published literature supported the results of  our analyses.

T2  - European journal of internal medicine
AB  - The clinical progression of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) to critical illness is associated with a systemic and uncontrolled  inflammatory response of the innate and adaptive immunity with the release of a  plethora of proinflammatory cytokines termed "cytokine storm". In the absence of  an effective treatment, many off-label agents from the armamentarium of  rheumatology are used. Here, from the perspective of a rheumatologist, we will  discuss the current therapeutic strategies in critically ill patients with  SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Thus, we will discuss the agents that aim to target viral  entry and its replication into the host cell and those focusing and targeting the  inflammatory response. In this setting, many agents have been used with promising  results but, not all have been approved by the International Authorities and  Institutions. In the first step (viral entry), SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies  and remdesivir have been approved to be used and, in the second step,  corticosteroids along with interleukin-6 inhibitors, or Janus Kinase inhibitors  are currently used.

AB  - MOTIVATION: The outbreak of coronavirus health issues caused by COVID-19(SARS-CoV-2) creates a global threat to public health. Therefore, there  is a need for effective remedial measures using existing and approved therapies  with proven safety measures has several advantages. Dexamethasone (Pubchem ID:  CID0000005743), baricitinib(Pubchem ID: CID44205240), remdesivir (PubchemID:  CID121304016) are three generic drugs that have demonstrated in-vitro high  antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. The present study aims to widen the search  and explore the anti-SARS-CoV-2 properties of these potential drugs while looking  for new drug indications with optimised benefits via in-silico research. METHOD:  Here, we designed a unique drug-similarity model to repurpose existing drugs  against SARS-CoV-2, using the anti-Covid properties of dexamethasone,  baricitinib, and remdesivir as references. Known chemical-chemical interactions  of reference drugs help extract interactive compounds withimprovedanti-SARS-CoV-2  properties. Here, we calculated the likelihood of these drug compounds treating  SARS-CoV-2 related symptoms using chemical-protein interactions between the  interactive compounds of the reference drugs and SARS-CoV-2 target genes. In  particular, we adopted a two-tier clustering approach to generate a drug  similarity model for the final selection of potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug  molecules. Tier-1 clustering was based on t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor  Embedding (t-SNE) and aimed to filter and discard outlier drugs. The tier-2  analysis incorporated two cluster analyses performed in parallel using Ordering  Points To Identify the Clustering Structure (OPTICS) and Hierarchical  Agglomerative Clustering (HAC). As a result, itidentified clusters of drugs with  similar actions. In addition, we carried out a docking study for in-silico  validation of top candidate drugs. RESULT: Our drug similarity model highlighted  ten drugs, including reference drugs that can act as potential therapeutics  against SARS-CoV-2. The docking results suggested that doxorubicin showed the  least binding energy compared to reference drugs. Their practical utility as  anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs, either individually or in combination, warrants further  investigation.

AB  - PURPOSE: In the wake of SARS-CoV-2's global spread, human activities from health to social life to education have been affected. Favipiravir and  Molnupiravir exhibited novel hexokinase inhibition and we discuss advantages of  this property in their COVID-19 inhibition potential. METHODS: This paper  describes molecular docking data of human hexokinase II with Favipiravir, Cyan  20, Remdesivir, 2DG, and Molnupiravir along with hexokinase inhibition assays.  RESULTS: Favipiravir, an antiviral drug previously cleared for treating the flu  and ebola, has shown some promise in early trials to treat COVID-19. We observed  potent human hexokinase inhibiting potential of Favipiravir (50%) as against 4%  and merely 0.3% hexokinase inhibition with Molnupiravir and 2 Deoxy D glucose at  0.1 mM concentration supported by molecular docking studies. CONCLUSION:  Favipiravir could continue to be part of the COVID-19 treatment regimen due to  its resistance to host esterases, hexokinase inhibition potential and proven  safety through human trials.

AB  - PURPOSE: Studies pertaining to the effect of COVID-19 infection on male fertility are scarce. This case report describes a case of transient asthenozoospermia,  absence of sperm motility, following a moderately severe COVID-19 infection.  CASE: A couple presenting for infertility treatment due to low ovarian reserve  presented for their second intrauterine insemination (IUI). Their first IUI was  performed 1 month earlier when the semen parameters were normal. A couple of  weeks before the second IUI, the unvaccinated 48-year-old male partner contracted  COVID-19 and was admitted to the hospital for several days. He received IV  Remdesivir and continuous oxygen by nasal cannula. His hospitalization did not  require intubation or intensive care unit admission. He was discharged after  12 days of hospitalization without home oxygen treatment. On the day of the  second IUI, the semen analysis showed a normal sperm count with 0% motility.  Three months following his COVID-19 diagnosis, a repeat semen analysis showed  restored normal parameters with more than 40% motility. CONCLUSION: This aim of  this report is to increase awareness that moderate COVID-19 requiring  hospitalization could affect, though temporarily, sperm motility and should be  considered in the differential diagnosis when male infertility is encountered.

AB  - COVID-19 is highly contagious and is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. It spreads by means of respiratory droplets and close contact with  infected persons. With the progression of disease, numerous complications  develop, particularly among persons with chronic illnesses. Pathological  investigations indicate that it affects multiple organs and can induce acute  respiratory distress syndrome. Prevention is vital and self-isolation is the best  means of containing this virus. Good community health practices like maintaining  sufficient distance from other people, wearing protective face masks and regular  hand washing should be adopted. Convalescent plasma transfusion and the  administration of the antiviral Remdesivir have been found to be effective.  Vaccines offer lifesaving protecting against COVID-19 which has killed millions  and our best bet for staying safe. Screening, suppression/containment as well as  mitigation are the strategies implemented for controlling COVID-19 pandemic.  Vaccination is essential to end the COVID-19 pandemic and everyone should have an  access to them. The current COVID-19 pandemic brought the global economy to a  standstill and has exacted an enormous human and financial toll.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The benefits of remdesivir in the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 remain debated with the National Institutes of Health and the World  Health Organization providing contradictory recommendations for and against use.  OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the role of remdesivir for hospitalized inpatients as a  function of oxygen requirements. DATA SOURCES: Beginning with our prior  systematic review, we searched MEDLINE using PubMed from 15 January 2021 through  5 May 2022. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials; all  languages. PARTICIPANTS: All hospitalized adults with COVID-19. INTERVENTIONS:  Remdesivir, in comparison to either placebo, or standard of care. ASSESSMENT OF  RISK OF BIAS: We used the ROB-2 criteria. METHODS OF DATA SYNTHESIS: The primary  outcome was mortality, stratified by oxygen use (none, supplemental oxygen  without mechanical ventilation, and mechanical ventilation). We conducted a  frequentist random effects meta-analysis on the risk ratio scale and, to  contextualize the probabilistic benefits, we also performed a Bayesian random  effects meta-analysis on the risk difference scale. A ≥1% absolute risk reduction  was considered clinically important. RESULTS: We identified eight randomized  trials, totaling 10 751 participants. The risk ratio for mortality comparing  remdesivir vs. control was 0.77 (95% CI, 0.5-1.19) in the patients who did not  require supplemental oxygen; 0.89 (95% CI, 0.79-0.99) for nonventilated patients  requiring oxygen; and 1.08 (95% CI, 0.88-1.31) in the setting of mechanical  ventilation. Using neutral priors, the probabilities that remdesivir reduces  mortality were 76.8%, 93.8%, and 14.7%, respectively. The probability that  remdesivir reduced mortality by ≥ 1% was 77.4% for nonventilated patients  requiring oxygen. CONCLUSIONS: Based on this meta-analysis, there is a high  probability that remdesivir reduces mortality for nonventilated patients with  COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen therapy. Treatment guidelines should be  re-evaluated.

AB  - Besides pandemic SARS-CoV-2, also endemic seasonal human common cold coronaviruses (hCoVs) have a significant impact on human health and economy.  Studies on hCoVs and the identification of antivirals are therefore crucial to  improve human well-being. However, hCoVs have long been neglected and the  methodology to study virus infection, replication and inhibition warrants being  updated. We here evaluated the established plaque-based assays to determine viral  titers and cell-to-cell spread and developed protocols for the immunodetection of  the viral nucleocapsid protein by flow cytometry and in-cell ELISA to study  infection rates at early time points. The developed protocols allow detection of  hCoV-229E infection after 2, and hCoV-NL63 and -OC43 infection after 3 days at a  single cell level or in a 96 well microtiter format, in large sample numbers  without being laborious or expensive. Both assays can be applied to assess the  susceptibility of cells to hCoV infection and replication, and to determine the  efficacy of antiviral compounds as well as neutralizing antibodies in a sensitive  and quantitative manner. Application revealed that clinically applied SARS-CoV-2  targeting monoclonal antibodies are inactive against hCoVs, but that the viral  polymerase targeting antivirals remdesivir and molnupiravir are broadly active  also against all three hCoVs. Further, the in-cell ELISA provided evidence that  nirmatrelvir, previously shown to broadly inhibit coronavirus proteases, also  prevents replication of authentic hCoVs. Importantly, the protocols described  here can be easily adapted to other coronavirus strains and species as well as  viruses of other families within a short time. This will facilitate future  research on known and emerging (corona)viruses, support the identification of  antivirals and increase the preparedness for future virus outbreaks.

AB  - Despite the great success of the administered vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, the virus can still spread, as evidenced by the current circulation of the highly  contagious Omicron variant. This emphasizes the additional need to develop  effective antiviral countermeasures. In the context of early preclinical studies  for antiviral assessment, robust cellular infection systems are required to  screen drug libraries. In this study, we reported the implementation of a human  glioblastoma cell line, stably expressing ACE2, in a SARS-CoV-2 cytopathic effect  (CPE) reduction assay. These glioblastoma cells, designated as U87.ACE2(+),  expressed ACE2 and cathepsin B abundantly, but had low cellular levels of TMPRSS2  and cathepsin L. The U87.ACE2(+) cells fused highly efficiently and quickly with  SARS-CoV-2 spike expressing cells. Furthermore, upon infection with SARS-CoV-2  wild-type virus, the U87.ACE2(+) cells displayed rapidly a clear CPE that  resulted in complete cell lysis and destruction of the cell monolayer. By means  of several readouts we showed that the U87.ACE2(+) cells actively replicate  SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, the U87.ACE2(+) cells could be successfully  implemented in an MTS-based colorimetric CPE reduction assay, providing IC(50)  values for Remdesivir and Nirmatrelvir in the (low) nanomolar range. Lastly, the  U87.ACE2(+) cells were consistently permissive to all tested SARS-CoV-2 variants  of concern, including the current Omicron variant. Thus, ACE2 expressing  glioblastoma cells are highly permissive to SARS-CoV-2 with productive viral  replication and with the induction of a strong CPE that can be utilized in  high-throughput screening platforms.

AB  - Management of COVID-19 in lung transplant recipients is challenging. We report a case of a 71-year-old male who underwent bilateral lung transplantation with an  unexpected case of COVID-19. The patient had been fully vaccinated. The patient  and donor tested negative for pretransplant COVID-19. On routine bronchoscopy on  day 1 after transplant, the COVID-19 test was positive. Mycophenolic mofetil and  the second dose of basiliximab were skipped, but tacrolimus and prednisone were  continued. He was treated with casirivimab/imdevimab and remdesivir. He was  discharged on day 14 and has had no episodes of acute rejection during the 3  months.

AB  - Remdesivir (RDV), dexamethasone (DEX) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) were widely used in the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia, possibly causing environmental risks  and drug-resistance viruses. This study elucidated the degradation mechanisms and  potential toxicity risks of the three anti-COVID-19 drugs by UV and  ultraviolet-coupled advanced oxidation processes (UV/AOPs). All the drugs could  be degraded by more than 98% within 3 min under the following optimal conditions:  pH of 5.0 and drug-to-oxidant (H(2)O(2)) molar ratio of 1:200. Combined with  density functional theory (DFT) analysis and high-performance liquid  chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-QTOF-MS),  twenty-four transformation products (TPs) were detected and the main degradation  pathways were investigated. Based on bacterial luminescence inhibition test and  the peak-area evolution of TPs, RDV and HCQ showed an obvious toxicity-increase  region when TPs were generated in large quantities, while the toxicity of DEX  continued to decline during degradation processes. By QSAR predictions, the main  contributors to the toxicity evolution during the UV/AOPs were predicted.  Halogen-containing TPs showed significantly higher toxicity than other TPs, and  thus the chlorine-containing structure in HCQ presented the potential toxicity.  Appropriate reaction parameters and adequate reaction time for the UV/AOPs could  eliminate the toxicity of TPs and ensure environmental safety. This study could  play a positive role in the treatment of anti-COVID-19 drugs and their  environmental hazard assessment.

AB  - Remdesivir is a prodrug of a nucleoside analog and the first antiviral therapeutic approved for coronavirus disease. Recent cardiac safety concerns and  reports on remdesivir-related acute kidney injury call for a better  characterization of remdesivir toxicity and understanding of the underlying  mechanisms. Here, we performed an in vitro toxicity assessment of remdesivir  around clinically relevant concentrations (C(max) 9 µM) using H9c2 rat  cardiomyoblasts, neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes (NMCM), rat NRK-52E and human  RPTEC/TERT1 cells as cell models for the assessment of cardiotoxicity or  nephrotoxicity, respectively. Due to the known potential of nucleoside analogs  for the induction of mitochondrial toxicity, we assessed mitochondrial function  in response to remdesivir treatment, early proteomic changes in NMCM and  RPTEC/TERT1 cells and the contractile function of NMCM. Short-term treatments  (24 h) of H9c2 and NRK-52E cells with remdesivir adversely affected cell  viability by inhibition of proliferation as determined by significantly decreased  (3)H-thymidine uptake. Mitochondrial toxicity of remdesivir (1.6-3.1 µM) in  cardiac cells was evident by a significant decrease in oxygen consumption, a  collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential and an increase in lactate secretion  after a 24-48-h treatment. This was supported by early proteomic changes of  respiratory chain proteins and intermediate filaments that are typically involved  in mitochondrial reorganization. Functionally, an impedance-based analysis showed  that remdesivir (6.25 µM) affected the beat rate and contractility of NMCM. In  conclusion, we identified adverse effects of remdesivir in cardiac and kidney  cells at clinically relevant concentrations, suggesting a careful evaluation of  therapeutic use in patients at risk for cardiovascular or kidney disease.

AB  - A 53-year-old male Japanese patient with COVID-19 was admitted to our hospital after his respiratory condition worsened on day 9 of the disease. With the  diagnosis of severe COVID-19, treatment with remdesivir, dexamethasone, and  unfractionated heparin was started for the prevention of thrombosis. Although the  patient's respiratory status data improved after treatment, severe respiratory  failure persisted. Thrombocytopenia and D-dimer elevation were observed on day 8  after heparin therapy initiation. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) antibody  measured by immunological assay was positive, and contrast computed tomography  showed pulmonary artery thrombus. The patient was diagnosed with HIT because the  pre-test probability score (4Ts score) for HIT was 7 points. Heparin was changed  to apixaban, a direct oral anticoagulant, which resulted in a reduction of the  pulmonary thrombus and improvement of the respiratory failure. In patients with  COVID-19, anticoagulant therapy with heparin requires careful monitoring of  thrombocytopenia and elevated D-dimer as possible complications related to HIT.  (151/250 words).

AB  - Nucleoside analogues have long been designed and tested in cancer treatment and against viral infections. However, several early compounds were shown to have  mutagenic properties as a consequence of their mode-of-action. This limited their  use, and several have been discontinued for lengthy treatments or altogether.  Nonetheless, nucleoside analogues remain an attractive modality for virally  driven diseases, of which many still are without proper treatment options. To  quantitatively assess the genotoxic mode-of-action of a panel of nucleoside  analogues, we applied the ToxTracker® reporter assay. Many of the early  nucleoside analogues showed a genotoxic response. The more recently developed  nucleoside analogues, Remdesivir and Molnupiravir that are currently being  repurposed for Covid-19 treatment, had a different profile in ToxTracker and did  not induce the genotoxicity reporters. Our analyses support the metabolite  GS-441524 over the parent analogue Remdesivir. In contrast, Molnupiravir was  devoid of clear cellular toxicity while its active metabolite (EIDD-1931) was  cytotoxic and induced several biomarkers. Nucleoside analogues continue to be  attractive treatment options upon viral infections. ToxTracker readily  distinguished between the genotoxic analogues and those with different profiles  and provides a basis for clustering and potency ranking, offering a comprehensive  tool to assess the toxicity of nucleoside analogues.

AB  - Connexin43 (Cx43) hemichannels form a pathway for cellular communication between the cell and its extracellular environment. Under pathological conditions, Cx43  hemichannels release adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which triggers inflammation.  Over the past two years, azithromycin, chloroquine, dexamethasone, favipiravir,  hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, remdesivir, ribavirin, and ritonavir have been  proposed as drugs for the treatment of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),  which is associated with prominent systemic inflammation. The current study aimed  to investigate if Cx43 hemichannels, being key players in inflammation, could be  affected by these drugs which were formerly designated as COVID-19 drugs. For  this purpose, Cx43-transduced cells were exposed to these drugs. The effects on  Cx43 hemichannel activity were assessed by measuring extracellular ATP release,  while the effects at the transcriptional and translational levels were monitored  by means of real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain  reaction analysis and immunoblot analysis, respectively. Exposure to lopinavir  and ritonavir combined (4:1 ratio), as well as to remdesivir, reduced Cx43 mRNA  levels. None of the tested drugs affected Cx43 protein expression.

AB  - PURPOSE: The benefits of antiviral treatment with remdesivir in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 remain controversial. Clinical analyses are needed to  demonstrate which patient populations are most likely to benefit. METHODS: In a  retrospective monocentric analysis, patients with COVID-19 treated between July  1, 2020 and June 30, 2021 at Hospital St. Georg, Leipzig, Germany were evaluated.  The primary endpoint was time to clinical improvement, and the secondary endpoint  was 28-day mortality. Propensity score matching was used for the endpoint  analysis. RESULTS: A total of 839 patients were fully evaluated, 68% of whom  received specific COVID-19 drug therapy. Remdesivir was used in 31.3% of the  patients, corticosteroids in 61.7%, and monoclonal antibodies in 2.3%. While  dexamethasone administration was the most common therapeutic approach during the  second pandemic wave, combination therapy with remdesivir and corticosteroids  predominated during the third wave. Cox regression analysis revealed that  combination therapy was not associated with faster clinical improvement (median:  13 days in both matched groups, HR 0.97 [95% CI 0.77-1.21], P = 0.762). By  contrast, 28-day mortality was significantly lower in the  corticosteroid-remdesivir group (14.8% versus 22.2% in the corticosteroid group,  HR 0.60 [95% CI 0.39-0.95], P = 0.03) in the low-care setting. This effect was  also demonstrated in a subgroup analysis of patients with remdesivir monotherapy  (n = 44) versus standard of care (SOC). CONCLUSION: In COVID-19 patients with  only mild disease (low-flow oxygen therapy and treatment in a normal ward) who  received corticosteroids and/or remdesivir in addition to SOC, early  administration of remdesivir was associated with a measurable survival benefit.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pregnant women were excluded from investigational trials of COVID-19 vaccines. Limited data are available to inform pregnant and postpartum women on  their decisions to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. METHODS: The goal of this  observational, prospective cohort study is to evaluate the immunogenicity and  safety of various Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) or licensed COVID-19 vaccines  administered to pregnant or lactating women and describe the transplacental  antibody transfer and kinetics of antibodies in mothers and infants. The study is  adaptive, allowing additional groups to be added as new vaccines or vaccine  regimens are authorized. Up to 20 clinical research institutions in the United  States (U.S.) will be included. Approximately 200 pregnant women and 65  postpartum women will be enrolled per EUA or licensed COVID-19 vaccine  formulation in the U.S. This study will include pregnant and postpartum women of  all ages with and without chronic medical conditions. Their infants will be  enrolled and followed beginning at birth in the pregnant cohort and beginning at  the earliest possible time point in the postpartum cohort. Blood samples will be  collected for immunogenicity outcomes and pregnancy and birth outcomes assessed  among women and infants. Primary analyses will be descriptive and done by vaccine  type and/or platform. DISCUSSION: Given the long-standing and legitimate  challenges of enrolling pregnant individuals into clinical trials early in the  vaccine development pipeline, this study protocol describes our current study and  provides a template to inform the collection of data for pregnant individuals  receiving COVID-19 or other vaccines.

AB  - Following the sudden widespread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) which first appeared in Wuhan city. Remdesivir (REM) was the first medicine licensed by the  US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for COVID-19 infected hospitalized  patients. Hence, there was an urgent demand for the optimization of efficient  selective and sensitive methods to be developed for the determination of REM in  pharmaceuticals as well as biological samples. A sensitive and simple green  spectrofluorimetric method has been developed to determine REM in pharmaceutical  formulation, in addition to, spiked human plasma. The technique involves  measuring the native fluorescence of REM in distilled water at 410 nm followed by  excitation at 241 nm, giving a linear relationship over the range  50.00-500.00 ng/mL, and then improving the sensitivity of REM through micellar  formation using 2.00% w/v sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). A linear relationship has  been obtained over the range 10.00-350.00 ng/mL having detection and quantitation  limits of 2.34 and 7.10 ng/mL, respectively. Different analytical parameters have  been carefully studied. A validation study has been conducted successfully in  accordance with the FDA and the International Council for Harmonization of  Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) guidelines. The  developed methods' greenness was assessed utilizing a greenness profile and  analytical eco-scale standards. Both methods were discovered to be  environmentally friendly and could be successfully used for the determination of  the studied drugs in pharmaceutical formulation and human plasma with good  accuracy and high precision. As a result, the developed spectrofluorimetric  methods could be ideally suited for determination of REM in quality control and  medicinal laboratories.

AB  - The current COVID-19 pandemic is severely threatening public healthcare systems around the globe. Some supporting therapies such as remdesivir, favipiravir, and  ivermectin are still under the process of a clinical trial, it is thus urgent to  find alternative treatment and prevention options for SARS-CoV-2. In this regard,  although many natural products have been tested and/or suggested for the  treatment and prophylaxis of COVID-19, carotenoids as an important class of  natural products were underexplored. The dietary supplementation of some  carotenoids was already suggested to be potentially effective in the treatment of  COVID-19 due to their strong antioxidant properties. In this study, we performed  an in silico screening of common food-derived carotenoids against druggable  target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 including main protease, helicase, replication  complex, spike protein and its mutants for the recent variants of concern, and  ADP-ribose phosphatase. Molecular docking results revealed that some of the  carotenoids had low binding energies toward multiple receptors. Particularly,  crocin had the strongest binding affinity (-10.5 kcal/mol) toward the replication  complex of SARS-CoV-2 and indeed possessed quite low binding energy scores for  other targets as well. The stability of crocin in the corresponding receptors was  confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations. Our study, therefore, suggests that  carotenoids, especially crocin, can be considered an effective alternative  therapeutics and a dietary supplement candidate for the prophylaxis and treatment  of SARS-CoV-2. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: In this study, food-derived carotenoids as  dietary supplements have the potential to be used for the prophylaxis and/or  treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Using in silico techniques, we aimed at discovering  food-derived carotenoids with inhibitory effects against multiple druggable sites  of SARS-CoV-2. Molecular docking experiments against main protease, helicase,  replication complex, spike protein and its mutants for the recent variants of  concern, and ADP-ribose phosphatase resulted in a few carotenoids with  multitarget inhibitory effects. Particularly, crocin as one of the main  components of saffron exhibited strong binding affinities to the multiple drug  targets including main protease, helicase, replication complex, mutant spike  protein of lineage B.1.351, and ADP-ribose phosphatase. The stability of the  crocin complexed with these drug targets was further confirmed through molecular  dynamics simulations. Overall, our study provides the preliminary data for the  potential use of food-derived carotenoids, particularly crocin, as dietary  supplements in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND COVID-19 is treated using antiviral and immunosuppressive drugs. Therefore, patients treated for COVID-19 may have an increased risk of secondary  infection and a masked inflammatory response. We present a case of a deep neck  abscess caused by pyogenic sternoclavicular arthritis during treatment for  COVID-19. CASE REPORT A 55-year-old man with COVID-19 was admitted to the  hospital with hypoxemia. He was then treated with remdesivir, tocilizumab, and  dexamethasone and was placed in the prone position. When his condition  stabilized, pain in the left shoulder appeared. There was no fever or elevation  in inflammation markers, and he was administered analgesics. However, the pain  worsened and redness of the left neck appeared. Plain computed tomography (CT)  showed swelling of the left neck muscles. Because cellulitis was suspected, he  was treated with antibiotics, but his symptoms did not improve. Three days after  the plain CT, contrast-enhanced CT showed sternoclavicular arthritis, deep neck  abscess, and mediastinal abscess. Therefore, an emergency incisional drainage was  performed under general anesthesia. Wound cleaning and drainage were continued  after surgery, and after drainage tubes were removed, the patient was discharged  on postoperative day 17. CONCLUSIONS Cervical infections after COVID-19 treatment  have been reported in a few cases. Particularly, deep neck abscesses require more  attention since they could be fatal if not treated immediately. If a secondary  infection is suspected in a patient treated with immunosuppressive drugs for  COVID-19, a thorough physical examination should be performed to avoid  misdiagnosis.

AB  - A man in mid-50s presented with progressive blurred vision in his left eye for over 6 weeks. He was a known diabetic with history of COVID-19 pneumonia treated  with steroids and remdesivir. He had pyelonephritis and urinary culture grown  Klebsiella He was referred as a case of non-resolving vitreous haemorrhage.  Visual acuity (VA) was hand movements with fundus showing dense vitritis. He  underwent pars plana vitrectomy, vitreous biopsy with intraocular antibiotics  (imipenem) suspecting as a case of endogenous bacterial endophthalmitis. Vitreous  biopsy did not yield organisms on the smear/culture. The patient's condition  worsened with perception of light and fundus showing dense vitritis with discrete  yellowish white deposits on the surface of the retina. A repeat vitreous biopsy  done along with intravitreal injection of voriconazole (suspecting fungal  aetiology) grown fungal colonies and the organism was identified as Cryptococcus  laurentii At 4-month follow-up, the VA improved to 6/24.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are statements that should be rigorously developed to guide clinicians' decision-making. However, given the  scarce evidence for certain vulnerable groups like children, CPGs'  recommendations formulation could be challenging. METHODS: We conducted a scoping  review of CPGs for COVID-19 management in children. Documents were included if  they claimed to be a "clinical practice guideline", published between January and  October 2021, and described the process followed to issue their recommendations.  We assessed the quality using the "Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and  Evaluation II" (AGREE-II) and described how the recommendations were reached.  RESULTS: We found five CPGs that fulfilled our inclusion criteria. The median  score on the overall AGREE-II evaluation was 61% (range: 49%-72%), and the score  on the third domain referred to the rigor of methodological development was 52%  (range: 25%-88%). Recommendations for remdesivir, tocilizumab, and intravenous  immunoglobulin were heterogeneous across CPGs (in favor, against, no  recommendation), as well as the methodologies used to present the evidence,  perform the benefits/harms balance, and issue the recommendation. CONCLUSIONS:  Heterogeneous recommendations and justifications across CPGs were found in the  three assessed topics. Future CPGs should describe in detail their  evidence-to-decision process to issue reliable and transparent recommendations.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The effectiveness of a 3-day course of remdesivir to prevent severe disease in patients with COVID-19 who received solid organ transplant (SOT) is  unknown. We wanted to study the efficacy of this therapeutic option in patients  with COVID-19 who received SOT in preventing both hospitalizations for  outpatients and clinical worsening due to COVID-19 for those already hospitalized  for other reasons. METHODS: This is a single-center, retrospective, observational  study conducted in the Fondazione IRCSS Policlinico San Matteo of Pavia, Northern  Italy. We extracted all the data of patients with COVID-19 receiving SOT who  received and did not receive pre-emptive remdesivir between December 23, 2021,  and February 26, 2022. We used a Cox proportional hazard model to assess whether  receiving pre-emptive remdesivir was associated with lower rates of  hospitalization. RESULTS: A total of 24 patients who received SOT were  identified. Among these, seven patients (29, 1%) received pre-emptive remdesivir,  whereas 17 (70, 9%) patients did not. Receiving remdesivir significantly reduced  the hospitalization rate in outpatients who received SOT and the clinical  worsening of the condition of already hospitalized patients who received SOT  (hazard ratio 0.05; confidence interval [0.00-0.65], P-value = 0.01). CONCLUSION:  In our cohort of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 who received SOT, pre-emptive  remdesivir was effective in reducing the hospitalization rate due to COVID-19 and  in preventing the clinical worsening of the condition of patients who received  SOT who were hospitalized for reasons other than COVID-19.

AB  - Genetic variation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in the emergence and rapid spread of multiple variants throughout  the pandemic, of which Omicron is currently the predominant variant circulating  worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern/variants of interest (VOC/VOI) have  evidence of increased viral transmission, disease severity, or decreased  effectiveness of vaccines and neutralizing antibodies. Remdesivir (RDV [VEKLURY])  is a nucleoside analog prodrug and the first FDA-approved antiviral treatment of  COVID-19. Here, we present a comprehensive antiviral activity assessment of RDV  and its parent nucleoside, GS-441524, against 10 current and former SARS-CoV-2  VOC/VOI clinical isolates by nucleoprotein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  (ELISA) and plaque reduction assay. Delta and Omicron variants remained  susceptible to RDV and GS-441524, with 50% effective concentration (EC(50))  values 0.30- to 0.62-fold of those observed against the ancestral WA1 isolate.  All other tested variants exhibited EC(50) values ranging from 0.13- to 2.3-fold  of the observed EC(50) values against WA1. Analysis of nearly 6 million publicly  available variant isolate sequences confirmed that Nsp12, the RNA-dependent RNA  polymerase (RdRp) target of RDV and GS-441524, is highly conserved across  variants, with only 2 prevalent changes (P323L and G671S). Using recombinant  viruses, both RDV and GS-441524 retained potency against all viruses containing  frequent variant substitutions or their combination. Taken together, these  results highlight the conserved nature of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp12 and provide evidence  of sustained SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity of RDV and GS-441524 across the tested  variants. The observed pan-variant activity of RDV supports its continued use for  the treatment of COVID-19 regardless of the SARS-CoV-2 variant.

AB  - The rise of the novel virus SARS-CoV2 which causes the disease known as COVID-19 has led to a global pandemic claiming millions of lives. With no clinically  approved treatment for COVID-19, physicians initially struggled to treat the  disease, and a need remains for improved antiviral therapies in this area. It is  conceived early in the pandemic that an inhalable formulation of the drug  remdesivir which directly targets the virus at the site of infection could  improve therapeutic outcomes in COVID-19. A set of requirements are developed  that would be conducive to rapid drug approval: 1) try to use GRAS reagents 2)  minimize excipient concentration and 3) achieve a working concentration of  5 mg/mL remdesivir to obtain a deliverable dose which is 5-10% of the IV dose. In  this work, it is discovered that Poly(2-oxazoline) block copolymers can stabilize  drug nanocrystal suspensions and provide suitable formulation characteristics for  aerosol delivery while maintaining antiviral efficacy. The authors believe POx  block copolymers can be used as a semi-ubiquitous stabilizer for the rapid  development of nanocrystal formulations for new and existing diseases.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, has infected over 260 million people over the past 2  years. Remdesivir (RDV, VEKLURY®) is currently the only antiviral therapy fully  approved by the FDA for the treatment of COVID-19. The parent nucleoside of RDV,  GS-441524, exhibits antiviral activity against numerous respiratory viruses  including SARS-CoV-2, although at reduced in vitro potency compared to RDV in  most assays. Here we find in both human alveolar and bronchial primary cells,  GS-441524 is metabolized to the pharmacologically active GS-441524 triphosphate  (TP) less efficiently than RDV, which correlates with a lower in vitro SARS-CoV-2  antiviral activity. In vivo, African green monkeys (AGM) orally dosed with  GS-441524 yielded low plasma levels due to limited oral bioavailability of <10%.  When GS-441524 was delivered via intravenous (IV) administration, although plasma  concentrations of GS-441524 were significantly higher, lung TP levels were lower  than observed from IV RDV. To determine the required systemic exposure of  GS-441524 associated with in vivo antiviral efficacy, SARS-CoV-2 infected AGMs  were treated with a once-daily IV dose of either 7.5 or 20 mg/kg GS-441524 or IV  RDV for 5 days and compared to vehicle control. Despite the reduced lung TP  formation compared to IV dosing of RDV, daily treatment with IV GS-441524  resulted in dose-dependent efficacy, with the 20 mg/kg GS-441524 treatment  resulting in significant reductions of SARS-CoV-2 replication in the lower  respiratory tract of infected animals. These findings demonstrate the in vivo  SARS-CoV-2 antiviral efficacy of GS-441524 and support evaluation of its orally  bioavailable prodrugs as potential therapies for COVID-19.

TI  - Remdesivir and three other drugs for hospitalised patients with COVID-19: final results of the WHO Solidarity randomised trial and updated meta-analyses.
T2  - Lancet (London, England)
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Solidarity trial among COVID-19 inpatients has previously reported interim mortality analyses for four repurposed antiviral drugs.  Lopinavir, hydroxychloroquine, and interferon (IFN)-β1a were discontinued for  futility but randomisation to remdesivir continued. Here, we report the final  results of Solidarity and meta-analyses of mortality in all relevant trials to  date. METHODS: Solidarity enrolled consenting adults (aged ≥18 years) recently  hospitalised with, in the view of their doctor, definite COVID-19 and no  contraindication to any of the study drugs, regardless of any other patient  characteristics. Participants were randomly allocated, in equal proportions  between the locally available options, to receive whichever of the four study  drugs (lopinavir, hydroxychloroquine, IFN-β1a, or remdesivir) were locally  available at that time or no study drug (controls). All patients also received  the local standard of care. No placebos were given. The protocol-specified  primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality, subdivided by disease severity.  Secondary endpoints were progression to ventilation if not already ventilated,  and time-to-discharge from hospital. Final log-rank and Kaplan-Meier analyses are  presented for remdesivir, and are appended for all four study drugs.  Meta-analyses give weighted averages of the mortality findings in this and all  other randomised trials of these drugs among hospital inpatients. Solidarity is  registered with ISRCTN, ISRCTN83971151, and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04315948.  FINDINGS: Between March 22, 2020, and Jan 29, 2021, 14 304 potentially eligible  patients were recruited from 454 hospitals in 35 countries in all six WHO  regions. After the exclusion of 83 (0·6%) patients with a refuted COVID-19  diagnosis or encrypted consent not entered into the database, Solidarity enrolled  14 221 patients, including 8275 randomly allocated (1:1) either to remdesivir  (ten daily infusions, unless discharged earlier) or to its control (allocated no  study drug although remdesivir was locally available). Compliance was high in  both groups. Overall, 602 (14·5%) of 4146 patients assigned to remdesivir died  versus 643 (15·6%) of 4129 assigned to control (mortality rate ratio [RR] 0·91  [95% CI 0·82-1·02], p=0·12). Of those already ventilated, 151 (42·1%) of 359  assigned to remdesivir died versus 134 (38·6%) of 347 assigned to control (RR  1·13 [0·89-1·42], p=0·32). Of those not ventilated but on oxygen, 14·6% assigned  to remdesivir died versus 16·3% assigned to control (RR 0·87 [0·76-0·99],  p=0·03). Of 1730 not on oxygen initially, 2·9% assigned to remdesivir died versus  3·8% assigned to control (RR 0·76 [0·46-1·28], p=0·30). Combining all those not  ventilated initially, 11·9% assigned to remdesivir died versus 13·5% assigned to  control (RR 0·86 [0·76-0·98], p=0·02) and 14·1% versus 15·7% progressed to  ventilation (RR 0·88 [0·77-1·00], p=0·04). The non-prespecified composite outcome  of death or progression to ventilation occurred in 19·6% assigned to remdesivir  versus 22·5% assigned to control (RR 0·84 [0·75-0·93], p=0·001). Allocation to  daily remdesivir infusions (vs open-label control) delayed discharge by about 1  day during the 10-day treatment period. A meta-analysis of mortality in all  randomised trials of remdesivir versus no remdesivir yielded similar findings.  INTERPRETATION: Remdesivir has no significant effect on patients with COVID-19  who are already being ventilated. Among other hospitalised patients, it has a  small effect against death or progression to ventilation (or both). FUNDING: WHO.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has been inflicted upon humanity by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the latest insidious incarnation of the coronaviruses group. While in its wake  intense scientific research has produced breakthrough vaccines and cures, there  still exists an immediate need to further understand the origin, mechanobiology  and biochemistry, and destiny of this virus so that future pandemics arising from  similar coronaviruses may be contained more effectively. In this Perspective, we  discuss the various evidential findings of virus propagation and connect them to  respective underpinning cellular biomechanical states leading to corresponding  manifestations of the viral activity. We further propose avenues to tackle the  virus, including from a "musical" vantage point, and contain its relentless  strides that are currently afflicting the global populace.

TI  - Dual targeting of RdRps of SARS-CoV-2 and the mucormycosis-causing fungus: an in silico perspective.
AU  - Elfiky, Abdo A.
T2  - Future microbiology
AB  - During the past few months, mucormycosis has been associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections. Molecular docking combined with molecular dynamics simulation is  utilized to test nucleotide-based inhibitors against the RdRps of SARS-CoV-2  solved structure and Rhizopusoryzae RdRp model built in silico. The results  reveal a comparable binding affinity of sofosbuvir, galidesivir, ribavirin and  remdesivir compared with the physiological nucleotide triphosphates against  R.oryzae RdRp as well as the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp as reported before. Additionally,  other compounds such as setrobuvir, YAK, IDX-184 and modified GTP compounds 2,  3 and 4 show potential calculated average binding affinities against R. oryzae  RdRp. The present in silico study suggests the dual inhibition potential of the  recommended drugs and compounds against SARS-CoV-2 and R.oryzae RdRps.

AB  - PURPOSE: Vortioxetine an anti-depressant FDA-drug recently reported showing better in vitro efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: In this study, we have  synthesized ten new derivatives having alkenes, alkynes, benzyl, aryl, and mixed  carbamate at the N-terminal of vortioxetine. Then the binding energy and  interactions with the crucial amino acid residues in the binding pocket of main  protease (M(pro)) of SARS-CoV-2, of reported and ten newly synthesized  vortioxetine derivatives (total thirty-one) in comparison with remdesivir are  analyzed and presented in this paper. RESULTS: Based on the docking scores  predicted by ADV and AD, most vortioxetine derivatives showed better binding  efficiency towards M(pro) of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with remdesivir (an EUA  approved drug against SARS-CoV-2 M(pro)) and vortioxetine. CONCLUSION: This study  shows that some vortioxetine derivatives can be developed into promising drugs  for COVID-19 treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Remdesivir (GS-5734), an inhibitor of the viral RNA-dependent, RNA polymerase was early identified as a promising therapeutic  candidate against COVID-19. Our aim was to evaluate the impact of several  metabolic parameters on Remdesivir effectiveness among hospitalized COVID-19  patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted an observational study on patients  with SARS-CoV-2-related pneumonia admitted between May 2020 and September 2021 to  the COVID-19 Units of Internal Medicine, Pneumology and Intensive Care of  Garibaldi Hospital, Catania, Italy, and treated with Remdesivir. The "Ordinal  Scale For Clinical Improvement" was used to assess patients' clinical improvement  within 28 days of hospitalization. Short-term mortality rate was also evaluated.  A total of 142 patients with SARS-CoV-2-related pneumonia were studied. The  prevalence of obesity (20.7% vs. 41.9%, p = 0.03), the average BMI (27.1 ± 4.4  vs. 31.1 ± 6.1, p < 0.01) and the mean LDL-C levels (78 ± 19 mg/dl vs.  103 ± 18 mg/dl, p = 0.03) were significantly lower in early-improved (EI)  compared to not-improved (NI) individuals. Obesity was negatively associated to  clinical improvement after Remdesivir (OR 0.48, 95%CI 0.17-0.97, p = 0.04). Both  obesity (OR 2.82, 95% CI 1.05-7.71, p = 0.04) and dyslipidemia (OR 2.78, 95%CI  1.17-7.16, p = 0.03) were significantly related to patients' mortality.  Dyslipidemic subjects experienced a slower clinical improvement than  non-dyslipidemic ones (Long-Rank p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Our study showed that  unfavorable metabolic conditions such as obesity and dyslipidemia could predict a  worse clinical response to Remdesivir as well as the mortality in hospitalized  COVID-19 patients. Further prospective and larger-scale studies are needed to  confirm these preliminary findings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: One of the purposes of outpatient treatment for COVID-19 patients is to prevent severe disease courses and hospitalization. There is a need for  evidence-based recommendations to be applied in primary care and specialized  outpatient settings. METHODS: This guideline was developed on the basis of  publications that were retrieved by a systematic search for randomized controlled  trials in the Cochrane COVID-19 trial registry. The quality of evidence was  assessed with GRADE, and structured consensus generation was carried out with  MAGICapp. RESULTS: Unvaccinated COVID-19 outpatients with at least one risk  factor for a severe disease course may be treated in the early phase of the  disease with sotrovimab, remdesivir, or nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. Molnupiravir may  also be used for such patients if no other clinically appropriate treatment  options are available. Immunosuppressed persons with COVID-19 who are at high  risk, and whose response to vaccination is expected to be reduced, ought to be  treated with sotrovimab. It should be noted, however, that the clinical efficacy  of sotrovimab against infections with the omicron subtype BA.2 is uncertain at  the currently used dose, as the drug has displayed reduced activity against this  subtype in vitro. COVID-19 patients at risk of a severe course may be offered  budesonide inhalation, according to an off-label recommendation of the German  College of General Practitioners and Family Physicians (other medical societies  do not recommend either for or against this treatment). Thrombo - embolism  prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin may be given to elderly patients or  those with a pre-existing illness. No recommendation is made concerning  fluvoxamine or colchicine. Acetylsalicylic acid, azithromycin, ivermectin,  systemic steroids, and vitamin D should not be used for the outpatient treatment  of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Drug treatment is now available for outpatients with  COVID-19 in the early phase. Nearly all of the relevant trials have been  conducted in unvaccinated subjects; this needs to be kept in mind in patient  selection.

AB  - The ongoing pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and subsequently, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has led to  the deaths of over 6.1 million people and sparked a greater interest in virology  to expedite the development process for antivirals. The US Food and Drug  Administration (FDA) granted emergency use authorization for three antivirals:  remdesivir, molnupiravir, and nirmatrelvir. Remdesivir and molnupiravir are  nucleoside analogs that undergo biotransformation to form active metabolites that  incorporate into new viral RNA to stall replication. Unlike remdesivir or  molnupiravir, nirmatrelvir is a protease inhibitor that covalently binds to the  SARS-CoV-2 3C-like protease to interrupt the viral replication cycle. A recent  study identified that remdesivir and the active metabolite of molnupiravir,  EIDD-1931, are substrates of equilibrative nucleoside transporters 1 and 2 (ENT1  and 2). Despite the ubiquitous expression of the ENTs, the preclinical efficacy  of remdesivir and molnupiravir is not reflected in wide-scale SARS-CoV-2 clinical  trials. Interestingly, downregulation of ENT1 and ENT2 expression has been shown  in lung epithelial and endothelial cells in response to hypoxia and acute lung  injury, although it has not been directly studied in patients with COVID-19. It  is possible that the poor efficacy of remdesivir and molnupiravir in these  patients may be partially attributed to the repression of ENTs in the lungs, but  further studies are warranted. This study investigated the interaction between  nirmatrelvir and the ENTs and found that it was a poor inhibitor of ENT-mediated  [(3) H]uridine uptake at 300 μM. Unlike for remdesivir or EIDD-1931, ENT activity  is unlikely to be a factor for nirmatrelvir disposition in humans; however,  whether this contributes to the similar in vitro and clinical efficacy will  require further mechanistic studies.

AB  - Inhibition of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) by nucleotide analogues with ribose modification provides a promising antiviral strategy for the treatment of  SARS-CoV-2. Previous works have shown that remdesivir carrying 1'-substitution  can act as a "delayed chain terminator", while nucleotide analogues with  2'-methyl group substitution could immediately terminate the chain extension.  However, how the inhibition can be established by the 3'-ribose modification as  well as other 2'-ribose modifications is not fully understood. Herein, we have  evaluated the potential of several adenosine analogues with 2'- and/or  3'-modifications as obligate chain terminators by comprehensive structural  analysis based on extensive molecular dynamics simulations. Our results suggest  that 2'-modification couples with the protein environment to affect the  structural stability, while 3'-hydrogen substitution inherently exerts "immediate  termination" without compromising the structural stability in the active site.  Our study provides an alternative promising modification scheme to orientate the  further optimization of obligate terminators for SARS-CoV-2 RdRp.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients are at high risk for complications from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Vaccination may mitigate  this risk; however, immunogenicity appears to be significantly impaired, with  reports of increased risk of breakthrough infection. It is unknown if vaccine  breakthrough infections are milder or as severe as infections in unvaccinated  patients. METHODS: We performed a multicenter matched cohort study between March  2020 and September 2021 to assess influence of COVID-19 vaccination on outcomes  of COVID-19 infection. Treatment characteristics and disease severity outcomes  were compared on the basis of vaccine status; breakthrough infections versus  unvaccinated infections. Variable ratio propensity score matching based on age,  sex, transplant type, and number of comorbidities, was used to develop the  analytic cohort. Logistic regression was used to assess the influence of  vaccination status on the selected outcomes. RESULTS: From a cohort of 511 SOT  patients with COVID-19, we matched 77 partially or fully vaccinated patients with  220 unvaccinated patients. Treatment characteristics including use of  dexamethasone, remdesivir, and antibiotics did not differ. Vaccinated  participants were more likely to receive tocilizumab, 15 of 77 (19.5%) versus 5  of 220 (2.3%), P  < 0.001. Disease severity outcomes including oxygen  requirement, mechanical ventilation, and mortality were similar among medically  attended vaccine breakthroughs compared with unvaccinated patients. CONCLUSIONS:  SOT recipients who develop medically attended COVID-19 following 1- or 2-dose  vaccination seem to have similar disease severity to unvaccinated patients who  develop infection. This is consistent with the requirement that SOT recipients  need 3 or more vaccine doses and emphasizes the importance of alternate  strategies for this population.

AB  - Many drugs have been marketed for treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, the disease that has caused a worldwide pandemic. However, in reported  clinical trials, almost 30% of patients with COVID-19 did not show any health  improvement. The 28-day survival rate was 69.5% when patients who required  highflow oxygen therapy (HFNC), ventilation, and extracorporeal membrane  oxygenation (ECMO) management were treated with remdesivir. The mortality rate of  patients receiving 6 mg dexamethasone was 27%, and that of patients treated with  tocilizumab and steroids was 31%. These results are unsatisfactory, and treatment  for patients with severe respiratory failure has not yet been established. In our  institution, we used remdesivir, methylprednisolone (mPSL) pulse therapy, and  tocilizumab in 20 patients with COVID-19 whose PaO2/FIO2 (P/F) ratio was <200,  and obtained good results for this combination therapy without any adverse  events. In this study, we report the possible efficacy and safety of this  treatment.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Procalcitonin (PCT) is an acute-phase reactant with concentrations ≥0.5 μg/L indicative of possible bacterial infection in patients with SARS-CoV-2  infection (COVID-19). Some with severe COVID-19 develop cytokine storm secondary  to virally driven hyper-inflammation. However, increased pro-inflammatory  cytokines are also seen in bacterial sepsis. This study aimed to assess the  clinical utility of a cytokine panel in the assessment of COVID-19 with bacterial  superinfections along with PCT and C-reactive protein (CRP). METHODS: The  retrospective analysis included serum cytokines (interleukins; IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8  and tumour necrosis factor (TNFα)) measured using Ella™ (Bio-Techne, Oxford, UK)  and PCT measured by Roche Cobas (Burgess Hill, UK) in patients admitted with  COVID-19 between March 2020 and January 2021. Patients enrolled into COVID-19  clinical trials, treated with Remdesivir/IL-6 inhibitors were excluded. The  cytokine data was compared between intensive care unit (ICU) patients, age  matched non-ICU patients and healthy volunteers as well as ICU patients with high  and normal PCT (≥0.5 vs. <0.5 μg/L). RESULTS: Cytokine concentrations and CRP  were higher in COVID-19 patients (76; ICU & non-ICU) vs. healthy controls (n =  24), all p<0.0001. IL-6, IL-8, TNFα and were higher in ICU patients (n = 46) vs.  non-ICU patients (n = 30) despite similar CRP. Among 46 ICU patients, the high  PCT group (n = 26) had higher TNFα (p<0.01) and longer ICU stay (mean 47 vs. 25  days, p<0.05). There was no difference in CRP and blood/respiratory culture  results between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Pro-inflammatory cytokines and PCT were  higher in COVID-19 patients requiring ICU admission vs. non-ICU admissions  despite no difference in CRP. Furthermore, TNFα was higher in those with high PCT  and requiring longer ICU admission despite no difference in CRP or rate of  bacterial superinfection.

T2  - Antiviral therapy
AB  - If a planned path reaches a dead-end, one can simply stop. Or one can turn around, walk back to the last intersection and take another path, or one can  consider taking few paths in parallel. The last scenario is reflective of the  journey of remdesivir, the first antiviral for the treatment of COVID-19, that  was approved by FDA less than 10 months after the isolation of SARS-CoV-2, the  virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. As of January 2022, 10 million  COVID-19 patients have been treated with remdesivir worldwide, but the journey of  this molecule started more than a decade earlier with the search for a cure of  hepatitis C virus. The development path of remdesivir before the emergence of  COVID-19 represents a valuable example of a preemptive pandemic preparedness, but  the pursuit of this path would not have been possible without sustaining support  of John C. Martin, whom we will sorely miss for his piercing vision,  uncompromising leadership, and genuine compassion for patients suffering around  the world.

AB  - Immunosuppressant conditions such as hematological malignancies increase the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. It has  been described in the literature that patients on anti-CD20 maintenance therapies  for lymphoid malignancies are susceptible to having recurrent flares together  with viral replication or reinfections, although these cases are scarce. These  patients are not well represented in randomized controlled trials, and as a  consequence, the evidence for the use of certain treatments in this scenario is  lacking. We present two cases of patients with B-cell lymphoma on remission and  treated with rituximab on maintenance. They developed at least 1 flare of  coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) after acute infection and always after  receiving rituximab. RT-PCR was positive in the nasopharyngeal swab and also in  plasma. Patients were treated during flares with remdesivir, hyperimmune plasma,  and corticosteroids. These two cases showed the unresolved problem of COVID-19 in  immunosuppressant patients and showed that despite the vast amount of information  available on SARS-CoV-2, information in this subgroup of patients is lacking.

AB  - We aimed to assess longitudinal changes in clinical indexes of corona disease 2019 (Covid-19) patients with mild pulmonary infection during 5 days of  remdesivir therapy and determine the effect of age and gender on remdesivir  adverse effects (AE). Patients' clinical data including inflammatory markers,  liver and renal function tests, and heart rate (HR) were extracted from medical  records. Linear mixed model (LMM) was used to analyze longitudinal changes in  patients' clinical indexes. Gender and age were inserted in LMM as covariates to  find their correlation with AE and clinical indexes. Of 84 patients, 35 patients  met our criteria for the study. There were significant increases in mean levels  of white blood cell (WBC; p = 0.005), alanine aminotransferase (ALT; p = 0.001),  aspartate aminotransferase (p = 0.001), blood urea nitrogen (BUN; p = 0.001), and  creatinine (p = 0.006), whereas mean levels of erythrocyte sedimentation rate  (p = 0.005), C-reactive protein (p = 0.001), alkaline phosphatase (p = 0.001),  and potassium (p = 0.003) decreased significantly. Estimated glomerular  filtration rate (p = 0.001) and HR (p = 0.001) showed a notable decline over the  course of treatment. LMM analysis showed that mean changes in WBC (β = 0.94,  p = 0.029), creatinine (β = 0.12, p = 0.020), and HR (β = 6.47, p = 0.008) were  greater in males than in females. Also, age of patients had a significant effect  on the mean changes of WBC (β = -0.02, p = 0.023), sodium (β = -0.06, p = 0.010),  BUN (β = 0.23, p = 0.001), and HR (β = -0.29, p = 0.001). Despite no renal and  liver dysfunction, Covid-19 patients with mild pulmonary infection may develop  some remdesivir AE and attributed side effects might be affected by gender and  age of patients.

AB  - Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and its severity is linked to the adverse outcomes of multiorgan involvement. We  attempted to assess the clinical outcomes and determinants of mortality in  patients admitted to our COVID-19 care center from May to November 2020 who  developed AKI through a retrospective examination of their case records. The data  of those who developed AKI were analyzed for their clinical parameters, clinical  presentation, history, laboratory parameters, urine output measurements,  requirements for dialysis, treatment, and treatment outcomes (discharge or  death). These outcomes were correlated to the comorbidities, laboratory  parameters, the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) AKI stage,  sequential organ failure assessment score, and need for dialysis or renal  replacement therapy. Of 1890 patients admitted, 132 (6.98%) patients developed  AKI. Of 450 deaths from all causes, 67 (14%) were in AKI patients. There were 100  (75.8%) males and 32 (24.8%) females. The mean age was 62.05 ± 11.48 years. The  median duration of stay was 7 days (interquartile range: 4--11.75 days). The  number of patients in AKI Stages 1, 2, and 3 was 1 (0.75%), 64 (48.48%), and 67  (50.75%), respectively. The most common symptoms were breathlessness (85.6%),  fever (84.5%), myalgia (81.19%), and weakness (76.5%). Multivariate analysis  showed that the determinants of mortality were a partial pressure of oxygen  saturation (pO(2)) of <75% and of 76%-85% compared with a pO(2) of >85%, not  receiving remdesivir, and KDIGO Stage >2.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic necessitates time-sensitive policy and implementation decisions regarding new therapies in the face of uncertainty. This  study aimed to quantify consequences of approving therapies or pursuing further  research: immediate approval, use only in research, approval with research (eg,  emergency use authorization), or reject. METHODS: Using a cohort state-transition  model for hospitalized patients with COVID-19, we estimated quality-adjusted  life-years (QALYs) and costs associated with the following interventions:  hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, casirivimab-imdevimab, dexamethasone,  baricitinib-remdesivir, tocilizumab, lopinavir-ritonavir, interferon beta-1a, and  usual care. We used the model outcomes to conduct cost-effectiveness and value of  information analyses from a US healthcare perspective and a lifetime horizon.  RESULTS: Assuming a $100 000-per-QALY willingness-to-pay threshold, only  remdesivir, casirivimab-imdevimab, dexamethasone, baricitinib-remdesivir, and  tocilizumab were (cost-) effective (incremental net health benefit 0.252, 0.164,  0.545, 0.668, and 0.524 QALYs and incremental net monetary benefit $25 249, $16  375, $54 526, $66 826, and $52 378). Our value of information analyses suggest  that most value can be obtained if these 5 therapies are approved for immediate  use rather than requiring additional randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (net  value $20.6 billion, $13.4 billion, $7.4 billion, $54.6 billion, and $7.1  billion), hydroxychloroquine (net value $198 million) is only used in further  RCTs if seeking to demonstrate decremental cost-effectiveness and otherwise  rejected, and interferon beta-1a and lopinavir-ritonavir are rejected (ie,  neither approved nor additional RCTs). CONCLUSIONS: Estimating the real-time  value of collecting additional evidence during the pandemic can inform policy  makers and clinicians about the optimal moment to implement therapies and whether  to perform further research.

AB  - Critically ill patients with COVID-19 face a higher risk of disease progression and complications. The current standard of care includes supportive care measures  and fluid management. The Recovery trial observed a reduction in all-cause,  28-day mortality (p<0.001) when patients with COVID-19 requiring oxygen therapy  received 6 mg of dexamethasone per day for 10 days. In contrast, in patients not  requiring oxygen, no benefit was observed: 28-day mortality rates for the  dexamethasone and routine care groups were 17.8% and 14%, respectively. To  corroborate these results, the World Health Organization (WHO) performed a  meta-analysis. The study showed that the use of systemic corticosteroids compared  with routine care placebo was associated with a decrease in all-cause, 28-day  mortality. With respect to the effectiveness of remdesivir, the ACTT-1 trial  found that the drug conferred a benefit on time to clinical improvement. The  subgroup analysis in the clinical trial also showed a benefit per mortality in  patients requiring supplemental oxygen, albeit not those in need of mechanical  ventilation.

AB  - Natural products possessing unique scaffolds may have antiviral activity but their complex structures hinder facile synthesis. A pharmacophore-oriented  semisynthesis approach was applied to (-)-maoelactone A (1) and oridonin (2) for  the discovery of anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents. The Wolff rearrangement/lactonization  cascade (WRLC) reaction was developed to construct the unprecedented  maoelactone-type scaffold during semisynthesis of 1. Further mechanistic study  suggested a concerted mechanism for Wolff rearrangement and a water-assisted  stepwise process for lactonization. The WRLC reaction then enabled the creation  of a novel family by assembly of the maoelactone-type scaffold and the  pharmacophore of 2, whereby one derivative inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in  HPA EpiC cells with a low EC(50) value (19±1 nM) and a high TI value (>1000),  both values better than those of remdesivir.

AB  - Severe COVID-19 is characterized by persistent lung inflammation, inflammatory cytokine production, viral RNA and a sustained interferon (IFN) response, all of  which are recapitulated and required for pathology in the SARS-CoV-2-infected  MISTRG6-hACE2 humanized mouse model of COVID-19, which has a human immune  system(1-20). Blocking either viral replication with remdesivir(21-23) or the  downstream IFN-stimulated cascade with anti-IFNAR2 antibodies in vivo in the  chronic stages of disease attenuates the overactive immune inflammatory response,  especially inflammatory macrophages. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection and  replication in lung-resident human macrophages is a critical driver of disease.  In response to infection mediated by CD16 and ACE2 receptors, human macrophages  activate inflammasomes, release interleukin 1 (IL-1) and IL-18, and undergo  pyroptosis, thereby contributing to the hyperinflammatory state of the lungs.  Inflammasome activation and the accompanying inflammatory response are necessary  for lung inflammation, as inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway reverses  chronic lung pathology. Notably, this blockade of inflammasome activation leads  to the release of infectious virus by the infected macrophages. Thus,  inflammasomes oppose host infection by SARS-CoV-2 through the production of  inflammatory cytokines and suicide by pyroptosis to prevent a productive viral  cycle.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Remdesivir and Dexamethasone represent the cornerstone of therapy for critically ill patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure caused by  Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, clinical efficacy and safety of  concomitant administration of Remdesivir and Dexamethasone (Rem-Dexa) in severe  COVID-19 patients on high flow oxygen therapy (HFOT) or non-invasive ventilation  (NIV) remains unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective cohort study that was  performed in two medical Intensive Care Units (ICUs) of a tertiary university  hospital. The clinical impact of Rem-Dexa administration in hypoxemic patients  with COVID-19, who required NIV or HFOT and selected on the simplified acute  physiology score II, the sequential organ failure assessment score and the  Charlson Comorbidity Index score, was investigated. The primary outcome was  28-day intubation rate; secondary outcomes were end-of-treatment clinical  improvement and PaO2/FiO2 ratio, laboratory abnormalities and clinical  complications, ICU and hospital length of stay, 28-day and 90-day mortality.  RESULTS: We included 132 patients and found that 28-day intubation rate was  significantly lower among Rem-Dexa group (19.7% vs 48.5%, p<0.01). Although the  end-of-treatment clinical improvement was larger among Rem-Dexa group (69.7% vs  51.5%, p = 0.05), the 28-day and 90-day mortalities were similar (4.5% and 10.6%  vs. 15.2% and 16.7%; p = 0.08 and p = 0.45, respectively). The logistic  regression and Cox-regression models showed that concomitant Rem-Dexa therapy was  associated with a reduction of 28-day intubation rate (OR 0.22, CI95% 0.05-0.94,  p = 0.04), in absence of laboratory abnormalities and clinical complications (p =  ns). CONCLUSIONS: In COVID-19 critically ill patients receiving HFO or NIV,  28-day intubation rate was lower in patients who received Rem-Dexa and this  finding corresponded to lower end-of-treatment clinical improvement. The  individual contribution of either Remdesevir or Dexamethasone to the observed  clinical effect should be further investigated.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is currently much uncertainty regarding the most optimal treatment for COVID-19. This study analyze the change in the clinical condition  of patients hospitalized for severe COVID-19 pneumonia and treated with  remdesivir in a real-life setting, based on the WHO Ordinal Scale. Clinical  complications, treatment safety, and impact of other associated drugs were also  analyzed. METHODS: We conducted an observational, retrospective study including  patients treated with remdesivir. The need for admission to the ICU, the length  of ICU and hospital stay, and the need for ventilatory support were analyzed. The  laboratory parameters, drugs administered concomitantly, and difference in the  length of hospital stay according to the concomitant treatment received were also  evaluated. A univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to  analyze associated factors. RESULTS: A total of 92 patients were included. The  mean length of hospital stay was 15 days, and 90% of the patients had been  discharged from the hospital 28 days after starting treatment with remdesivir.  The likelihood of hospital discharge among patients not presenting with  hypertension as a comorbidity was significantly higher than that of those with  this condition (HR = 3.19, P = 0.008). Nineteen patients had to be admitted to  the ICU (mean of 18 days). Approximately 11% required invasive mechanical  ventilation (mean of 22 days). Almost 37% of the patients received high-flow  oxygen therapy and 14% non-invasive mechanical ventilation. Four deaths were  recorded within the first week. Main adverse events were increases in  transaminase and creatinine levels. Nosocomial infections were more frequent when  remdesivir was combined with immunosuppressive drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with  severe COVID-19 pneumonia and treated with remdesivir require relatively  prolonged hospital stays, many with a need for ventilatory support and, in a  considerable proportion of cases, admission to the ICU. However, the observed  survival rate is high, and the drug is well tolerated.

AB  - COVID-19 together with variants have caused an unprecedented amount of mental and economic turmoil with ever increasing fatality and no proven therapies in sight.  The healthcare industry is racing to find a cure with multitude of clinical  trials underway to access the efficacy of repurposed antivirals, however the much  needed insights into the dynamics of pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and corresponding  pharmacology of antivirals are lacking. This paper introduces systematic  pathological model learning of COVID-19 dynamics followed by derivative free  optimization based multi objective drug rescheduling. The pathological model  learnt from clinical data of severe COVID-19 patients treated with remdesivir  could additionally predict immune T cells response and resulted in a dramatic  reduction in remdesivir dose and schedule leading to lower toxicities, however  maintaining a high virological efficacy.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has affected millions globally. Several studies have been carried out to uncover factors affecting the severity of the resulting infection.  Available location-specific data concerning the affective demographics as well as  clinical aspect of the disease remains limited. In this study, a number of  non-clinical as well as the clinical parameters were investigated for their role  in adverse progression of the disease in patients admitted to intensive care unit  (ICU) in a private tertiary hospital in Peshawar. The prevalence of comorbidities  hypertension and diabetes as well as mortality was higher in age group of 70-79  years. Dyspnea was significantly linked to sepsis, invasive ventilation, and  mortality; its late presentation, i.e. 15 to 20 days was significantly associated  with mortality (p-value < 0.02). Acute kidney injury and acute respiratory  distress syndrome were found to be the most strongly associated with sepsis and  septic shock. Neither remdesivir nor tocilizumab was effective in preventing the  infection-related complications, invasive ventilation, and mortality. Overall,  dyspnea was found to be an indicator of the worst progression of the disease.  Furthermore, while some parameters were closely linked, others were not.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Early prophylactic administration of anticoagulants is recommended in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A case of retroperitoneal  hemorrhage during inpatient treatment for COVID-19 is reported. CASE  PRESENTATION: A 69-year-old man was diagnosed with COVID-19 6 days after symptom  onset. After admission for difficulty of breathing, he was treated with steroid  pulse therapy, remdesivir, and heparin sodium. On day 16 after admission, his  hemoglobin and blood pressure dropped. Computed tomography showed a left  retroperitoneal hematoma and multiple areas of extravasation in bilateral  iliopsoas muscles. Anticoagulation therapy was stopped, and blood transfusion  therapy was chosen by considering poor general condition caused by severe  pneumonia. On day 19, the hemoglobin and blood pressure improved, and blood  transfusion was stopped. However, he died on day 25 due to pneumonia. CONCLUSION:  When retroperitoneal hemorrhage occurs as a complication of COVID-19, appropriate  treatment decision, transcatheter arterial embolization or conservative  treatment, should be chosen based on patient's condition.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2), a member of the coronavirus family, appeared in 2019 and has caused the largest global public  health and economic emergency in recent history, affecting almost all sectors of  society. SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus that relies on  RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity in viral transcription and  replication. Due to its high sequence and structural conservation in coronavirus  and new SARS-CoV-2 variants, RdRp has been recognized as the key therapeutic  target to design novel antiviral strategies. Nucleotide analogs (NAs), such as  remdesivir, is the most promising class of RdRp inhibitors to be used in the  treatment of COVID-19. However, the presence of exonucleases in SARS-CoV-2 caused  a great challenge to NAs; the excision of incorporated NAs will lead to viral  resistance to this group of inhibitors. Here, we expressed active RdRp protein in  both a eukaryotic expression system of baculovirus-infected insect cells and a  prokaryotic expression system of Escherichia coli cells. Nsp7 and nsp8 of the  functional RdRp holoenzyme were generated in E. coli. An in vitro RdRp activity  assay has been established with a reconstituted nsp12/nsp7/nsp8 complex and  biotin-labeled self-priming RNAs, and the activity of the RdRp complex was  determined by detecting binding and extension of RNAs. Moreover, to meet the  needs of high-throughput drug screening, we developed a fluorometric approach  based on dsRNA quantification to assess the catalytic activity of the RdRp  complex, which is also suitable for testing in 96-well plates. We demonstrated  that the active triphosphate form of remdesivir (RTP) and several reported  non-nucleotide analog viral polymerase inhibitors blocked the RdRp in the in  vitro RdRp activity assay and high-throughput screening model. This  high-throughput screening model has been applied to a custom synthetic chemical  and natural product library of thousands of compounds for screening SARS-CoV-2  RdRp inhibitors. Our efficient RdRp inhibitor discovery system provides a  powerful platform for the screening, validation, and evaluation of novel  antiviral molecules targeting SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, particularly for non-nucleotide  antivirals drugs (NNAs).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine if corticosteroid administration is associated with a SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test-positive result and to describe therapies  administered to SARS-CoV-2 infected children. METHODS: We collected  cross-sectional data from participants recruited in 41 pediatric emergency  departments (ED) in 10 countries between March 2020 and June 2021. Participants  were <18 years old, had signs or symptoms of, or risk factors for acute  SARS-CoV-2 infection, and had nucleic acid testing performed. To determine if  SARS-CoV-2 test status was independently associated with corticosteroid  administration, we used a multivariable conditional logistic regression model  matched by study site to compare treatments administered based on SARS-CoV-2 test  and disposition status. This analysis was repeated for the subgroup of study  participants who were hospitalized. RESULTS: 30.3% (3,121/10,315) of participants  were SARS-CoV-2-positive. Although remdesivir was more commonly administered to  SARS-CoV-2-positive children, use was infrequent (25/3120 [0.8%] vs 1/7188  [0.01%]; P = .001). Corticosteroid use was less common among SARS-CoV-2-positive  children (219/3120 [7.0%] vs 759/7190 [10.6%]; P < .001). Among hospitalized  children, there were no differences in provision of inotropes, respiratory  support, chest drainage or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation between groups.  Corticosteroid administration was associated with age, history of asthma,  wheezing, study month, hospitalization and intensive care unit admission; it was  not associated with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result overall (aOR: 0.91; 95%CI:  0.74, 1.12) or among the subgroup of those hospitalized (aOR: 1.04; 95%CI: 0.75,  1.44). CONCLUSIONS: Few disease-specific treatments are provided to  SARS-CoV-2-positive children; clinical trials evaluating therapies in children  are urgently needed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has emerged as a global pandemic that threatens thousands around the world. Observational  cohort studies have demonstrated that cancer patients have inferior outcomes due  to underlying malignancy, treatment-related immunosuppression, or increased  comorbidities. We aimed to examine the representation of cancer patients  (hematological malignancies and solid tumors) in COVID-19 therapeutic and  prophylactic interventional trials. METHODS: In this review, all randomized  controlled trials (RCTs) published between December 2019 and August 2021 were  included. We included only trials evaluating medications that were recommended by  NIH guidelines: steroids, tocilizumab, remdesivir, and REGN-COV2. RESULTS: The  search yielded 541 potentially relevant RCTs, 22 of which were considered  suitable. All trials included patients with solid cancer and hematological  malignancies in the formal reported inclusion criteria. However, only two trials  reported the accurate number of cancer patients included. Ten trials excluded  neutropenic patients and seven trials excluded thrombocytopenic patients. Eleven  trials excluded patients that were treated with any immunosuppression treatment.  None of the two trials that included cancer patients reported separate outcomes  for this population. CONCLUSION: Our systematic review shows that cancer patients  are underrepresented in COVID-19 interventional therapeutic trials, and evidence  regarding outcomes are lacking.

AB  - Remdesivir and Baricitinib have recently been approved by FDA for the treatment of moderate to severe COVID-19 pneumonia. However, there is limited research work  available to assess their beneficial effects. MATERIAL: We conducted  retrospective study comparing remdesivir and baricitinib-remdesivir combination  therapy in hospitalized adults with moderate to severe Covid-19. All the patients  received remdesivir for 5 days and one subgroup had received baricitinib (≤14  days) along with remdesivir. The decision to administer remdesivir only or  remdesivir along with baricitinib was the treating clinician's discretion. The  primary outcome was to assess the 28-day mortality. OBSERVATION: A total of 50  patients with moderate or severe COVID-19 pneumonia had received either  remdesivir alone or both remdesivir and baricinitib during the duration of 1st  April 2021 to 30th June 2021in our hospital. The 28-day mortality was 9.091% in  the combination group and 14.29% in the remdesivir only group (risk difference=  -5.195%, risk ratio for death=0.3634; 95% CI, 0.1281, 3.161; p=0. 0.3086).  Patients who had a FiO2 requirement of 100% at any point of time had 100%  mortality, irrespective of the drug received. CONCLUSION: Baricitinib and  remdesivir combination was superior to remdesivir alone in reducing 28-day  mortality among patients with moderate to severe Covid-19, although this  difference was statistically insignificant.

AB  - Drug repurposing is considered as a rapid strategy for COVID-19 drug discovery and many drugs have been tried for treatment of COVID-19. Antivirals like  favipiravir and remdesivir have become part of the COVID-19 Management Protocol  by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) as well as Maharashtra State  guidelines since beginning, after being approved by Drugs Controller General of  India (DCGI). Although these drugs have shown promising results, their efficacy  is still not proven completely and needs to be studied in large populations. The  purpose of our study was to evaluate the clinical outcomes in hospitalised  patients with COVID-19 treated with remdesivir and/or favipiravir. MATERIAL:  Retrospective analysis of medical records of 914 adult COVID-19 patients  hospitalized in a tertiary care center in Mumbai was conducted. We assessed the  following outcomes: severity of disease, need for oxygen supplementation,  incidence of complications, discharge from hospital or death, oxygen requirement  at the time of discharge, duration of hospital stay. These outcomes were compared  between patients who received remdesivir only, patients who received favipiravir  only, patients who received both remdesivir and favipiravir and patients who did  not receive either remdesivir or favipiravir (control group). OBSERVATION: Of  total 914 patients in our study, 55.79% patients received only remdesivir, 13.45%  received only favipiravir, 7.76% received remdesivir plus favipiravir and 22.97%  did not receive any antivirals. Higher number of patients in remdesivir only  group (60.19%) and remdesivir plus favipiravir groups (56.33%) required  supplemental oxygen [vs 32.38 % patients in control group and 24.39% in  favipiravir only group]. Highest number of patients (91.05%) in favipiravir only  group got discharged under Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines  closely followed by 88.73% in remdesivir plus favipiravir group, 88.43% in  remdesivir only group and 82.38 % patients in control group. 8.43% patients in  remdesivir only group, 6.5% in favipiravir only group, 7.04% in remdesivir plus  favipiravir group and 10.47 % patients in control group needed oxygen support  after discharge. CONCLUSION: Majority of patients in our study got discharged  under ICMR guidelines with higher proportion of patients in the treatment groups  as compared to the control group. Also, lesser number of patients in the  treatment groups required oxygen supplementation post discharge as compared to  the control group.

AB  - Corona virus disease is a global pandemic. One of the key issues has been the very high volume of patients presenting to health centres or hospitals during the  outbreak. It clearly overwhelms the human and mechanistic capacities available.  Therefore, early and effective predictors of clinical outcomes are required for  risk stratification. MATERIAL: This is hospital based retrospective study on  patients who were admitted in Covid wards/ICU at IGGMC. Patients were divided  into 3 groups- mild-moderate; severe; and critical based on their clinical  presentation on admission. Several biomarkers like WBC, platelets, N/L, CRP, LDH,  S. ferritin, d-dimer, CPK-MB, Serum creatinine, BUL, SGOT, SGPT, Serum albumin  were analysed before and after treatment. OBSERVATION: 110 patients were enrolled  in this study, 36 were classified into mild-moderate, 56 into severe and 18 into  critical. As all of mild-moderate patients were discharged and majority of  critical patients expired, biomarkers were compared between severe patients who  were discharged vs severe patients who died. Out of these biomarkers, CRP was  significantly decreased during course of treatment in severe patients who were  discharged (p = 0.004) in comparison to severe patients who died where CRP was  significantly increased (p = 0.001) (p value of difference being 0.00001). There  was also significant change in ferritin levels (p = 0.006), while other  biomarkers like WBC (p = 0.07), platelets (p = 0.066), N/L (p = 0.3), LDH (p =  0.06), d-dimer (p = 0.1), CPK-MB (p = 0.49), serum creatinine (p = 0.05), urea (p  = 0.06), S. albumin (p= 0.3), SGOT (p =0.07), SGPT (p=0.25) did not show  promising results. In addition, various treatment protocols were analysed by  comparing CRP before and after treatment. Severe patients were divided into 2  groups, who took injection Remdesivir along with antibiotics, LMWH, systemic  steroids vs who didn't, and CRP level were compared, but the difference was not  significant (p = 0.06). Pre and post treatment CRP was also compared for  Tocilizumab, Fevipiravir, Hydroxychloroquine, Doxycyline, but none of them were  able to decrease CRP significantly (p &gt; 0.05) in the severe or critical group  but these drugs were effective in reducing CRP significantly (p&lt;0.05) when  given in mild-moderate group or if the treatment was started early. CONCLUSION:  Increment in CRP and ferritin could effectively predict clinical outcome and  could be used for risk stratification but no available drug is effective in  reducing these biomarkers significantly in severe or critical group.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: SARS-CoV-2 entry requires the TMPRSS2 cell surface protease. Antiandrogen therapies reduce expression of TMPRSS2. OBJECTIVE: To determine if  temporary androgen suppression induced by degarelix improves clinical outcomes of  inpatients hospitalized with COVID-19. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The  Hormonal Intervention for the Treatment in Veterans With COVID-19 Requiring  Hospitalization (HITCH) phase 2, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized  clinical trial compared efficacy of degarelix plus standard care vs placebo plus  standard care on clinical outcomes in men hospitalized with COVID-19 but not  requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. Inpatients were enrolled at 14  Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals from July 22, 2020, to April 8, 2021.  Data were analyzed from August 9 to October 15, 2021. INTERVENTIONS: Patients  stratified by age, history of hypertension, and disease severity were centrally  randomized 2:1 to degarelix, (1-time subcutaneous dose of 240 mg) or a saline  placebo. Standard care included but was not limited to supplemental oxygen,  antibiotics, vasopressor support, peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis,  intravenous fluids, remdesivir, convalescent plasma, and dexamethasone. MAIN  OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The composite primary end point was mortality, ongoing  need for hospitalization, or requirement for mechanical ventilation at day 15  after randomization. Secondary end points were time to clinical improvement,  inpatient mortality, length of hospitalization, duration of mechanical  ventilation, time to achieve a temperature within reference range, maximum  severity of COVID-19, and the composite end point at 30 days. RESULTS: The trial  was stopped for futility after the planned interim analysis, at which time there  were 96 evaluable patients, including 62 patients randomized to the degarelix  group and 34 patients in the placebo group, out of 198 initially planned. The  median (range) age was 70.5 (48-85) years. Common comorbidities included chronic  obstructive pulmonary disorder (15 patients [15.6%]), hypertension (75 patients  [78.1%]), cardiovascular disease (27 patients [28.1%]), asthma (12 patients  [12.5%]), diabetes (49 patients [51.0%]), and chronic respiratory failure  requiring supplemental oxygen at baseline prior to COVID-19 (9 patients [9.4%]).  For the primary end point, there was no significant difference between the  degarelix and placebo groups (19 patients [30.6%] vs 9 patients [26.5%];  P = .67). Similarly, no differences were observed between degarelix and placebo  groups in any secondary end points, including inpatient mortality (11 patients  [17.7%] vs 6 patients [17.6%]) or all-cause mortality (11 patients [17.7%] vs 7  patents [20.6%]). There were no differences between degarelix and placebo groups  in the overall rates of adverse events (13 patients [21.0%] vs 8 patients [23.5%)  and serious adverse events (19 patients [30.6%] vs 13 patients [32.4%]), nor  unexpected safety concerns. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized  clinical trial of androgen suppression vs placebo and usual care for men  hospitalized with COVID-19, degarelix did not result in amelioration of COVID-19  severity.

AB  - Remdesivir was the first antiviral drug that received emergency use authorization from the United States Food and Drug Administration and is now formally approved  to treat COVID-19. Remdesivir is a nucleotide analogue that targets the  RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. The  solution of multiple RdRp structures has been one of the main axes of research in  the race against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Several hypotheses of the mechanism of  inhibition of RdRp by remdesivir have been proposed, although open questions  remain. This work uses molecular dynamics simulations to explore the impact of  remdesivir and two analogues as incoming nucleotides and of up to four  incorporations of remdesivir along the primer strand on RdRp. The simulation  results suggest that the overall structure and the dynamical behavior of RdRp are  destabilized by remdesivir and the two analogues in the incoming position. The  incorporation of remdesivir along the primer strand impacts specific non-bonded  interactions between the nascent RNA and the polymerase subunit, as well as the  overall dynamical networks on RdRp. The strongest impact on the structure and  dynamics are observed after three incorporations, when remdesivir is located at  position -A3, in agreement with previously reported experimental and  computational results. Our results provide atomic-level details of the role  played by remdesivir on the disruption of RNA synthesis by RdRp and the main  drivers of these disruptions.

AB  - We report on children with cancer in Hungary suffering from COVID-19, surveying a 13-months-long period of time. We performed a retrospective clinical trial  studying the medical documentation of children treated in seven centers of the  Hungarian Pediatric Oncology-Hematology Group. About 10% of children admitted to  tertiary hemato-oncological centers for anti-neoplastic treatment or diagnosis  for de novo malignancies were positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nearly  two-thirds of the infected patients were asymptomatic or had only mild symptoms  but showed seropositivity by 1-4.5 months after positive PCR. One third of the  SARS-CoV-2-positive children were hospitalized due to symptomatic COVID-19. Five  children required antiviral treatment with remdesivir. One child was referred to  the intensive care unit, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. Delay  in the scheduled anti-cancer treatment did not exceed 2 weeks in the majority  (89%) of cases. There was only one patient requiring treatment deferral longer  than a month. There was no COVID-19-related death in patients under 18 years of  age, and nor was multisystem inflammatory syndrome diagnosed. In conclusion,  SARS-CoV-2 infection did not represent an untoward risk factor among children  with cancer in Hungary.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is, at present, one of the most relevant global health problems. In the literature hepatic alterations have been described  in COVID-19 patients, and they are mainly represented by worsening of underlying  chronic liver disease leading to hepatic decompensation and liver failure with  higher mortality. Several potential mechanisms used by severe acute respiratory  syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to cause liver damage have been hypothesized.  COVID-19 primary liver injury is less common than secondary liver injury. Most of  the available data demonstrate how liver damage in SARS-CoV-2 infection is likely  due to systemic inflammation, and it is less likely mediated by a cytopathic  effect directed on liver cells. Moreover, liver alterations could be caused by  hypoxic injury and drugs (antibiotics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,  remdesivir, tocilizumab, tofacitinib and dexamethasone). SARS-CoV-2 infection can  induce multiple vascular district atherothrombosis by affecting simultaneously  cerebral, coronary and peripheral vascular beds. Data in the literature highlight  how the virus triggers an exaggerated immune response, which added to the  cytopathic effect of the virus can induce endothelial damage and a prothrombotic  dysregulation of hemostasis. This leads to a higher incidence of symptomatic and  confirmed venous thrombosis and of pulmonary embolisms, especially in central,  lobar or segmental pulmonary arteries, in COVID-19. There are currently fewer  data for arterial thrombosis, while myocardial injury was identified in 7%-17% of  patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection and 22%-31% in the intensive care  unit setting. Available data also revealed a higher occurrence of stroke and more  serious forms of peripheral arterial disease in COVID-19 patients. Hemostasis  dysregulation is observed during the COVID-19 course. Lower platelet count,  mildly increased prothrombin time and increased D-dimer are typical laboratory  features of patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, described as "COVID-19  associated coagulopathy." These alterations are correlated to poor outcomes.  Moreover, patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection are characterized by high  levels of von Willebrand factor with subsequent ADAMTS13 deficiency and impaired  fibrinolysis. Platelet hyperreactivity, hypercoagulability and hypofibrinolysis  during SARS-CoV-2 infection induce a pathological state named as  "immuno-thromboinflammation." Finally, liver dysfunction and coagulopathy are  often observed at the same time in patients with COVID-19. The hypothesis that  liver dysfunction could be mediated by microvascular thrombosis has been  supported by post-mortem findings and extensive vascular portal and sinusoidal  thrombosis observation. Other evidence has shown a correlation between  coagulation and liver damage in COVID-19, underlined by the transaminase  association with coagulopathy, identified through laboratory markers such as  prothrombin time, international normalized ratio, fibrinogen, D-dimer,  fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products and platelet count. Other possible  mechanisms like immunogenesis of COVID-19 damage or massive pericyte activation  with consequent vessel wall fibrosis have been suggested.

AB  - PURPOSE: COVID-19 patients on anti-CD20 treatment can suffer a delayed viral clearance and worse clinical outcome. We aim to present our experience with  remdesivir treatment in anti-CD20-treated patients with prolonged symptoms, a  patient population for which no data from randomized controlled trials are  available. METHODS: From the beginning of the pandemic until February 2021, we  included all consecutive patients from our healthcare network on anti-CD20  treatment with prolonged COVID-19 symptoms, who received remdesivir. Patient  informed consent was gathered and patients' charts were reviewed to collect  baseline data, COVID-19 history including time of symptom onset, diagnosis, data  on treatment and disease course. Patients or their next of kin were contacted in  March 2022 to assess long-term outcomes. RESULTS: We included 11 patients, who  received remdesivir at a median of 33 days after diagnosis. Eight patients showed  clinical improvement along with reductions in viral loads, one patient with  relapsing infection recovered after administration of convalescent plasma, and  two patients died. No clinical relapses were reported (median follow-up  13 months), while follow-up PCRs were not performed. One patient died of  underlying malignancy 8 months after recovery from COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: We  observed a benefit of antiviral therapy in a majority of COVID-19 patients on  anti-CD20 treatment, without any clinical relapses in the 1-year follow-up.  Although these data suggest that remdesivir might be a promising management  option in patients with delayed viral clearance, the lack of a control group is  an important limitation of the study design. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Ethikkommission  Ostschweiz, Scheibenackerstrasse 4, CH-9000 St. Gallen approved this case series.  Project-ID 2021-00349 EKOS 21/027.

AB  - PURPOSE: Women infected with SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy are at increased risk of developing severe illness and experience a higher rate of preterm births than  pregnant women who are not infected. The use of innovative or repurposed  therapies to treat COVID-19 patients is widespread; however, there are very  limited data regarding the patterns of use and safety profile of most of these  therapeutics in pregnant women. We assessed the patterns of use of COVID-19  therapeutics during pregnancy using data from the International Registry of  Coronavirus in Pregnancy (IRCEP). METHODS: The IRCEP is an international  observational cohort study intended to assess the risk of major obstetric and  neonatal outcomes among pregnant women with COVID-19. Women enrolled while  pregnant or within 6 months after end of pregnancy. Follow-up for women enrolled  while pregnant includes monthly online questionnaires throughout the pregnancy  and, for live births, through the infant's first 90 days of life. Participants  provide information on demographic characteristics, health history, COVID-19  tests and symptoms, medications, and obstetric and neonatal outcomes. RESULTS: A  total of 5780 women with COVID-19 during pregnancy were identified from the  IRCEP. Severity of COVID-19 was classified in 372 of them as severe, 3053  moderate, and 2355 mild. The most frequently reported COVID-19 therapies, other  than analgesics, included azithromycin (12.8%), steroids (3.5%), interferon  (2.4%), oseltamivir (2.1%), chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (1.7%), anticoagulants  (2.0%), antibodies (0.9%), and remdesivir (0.3%). Most drugs were preferentially  used for severe cases. Patterns of use varied by country. CONCLUSIONS: IRCEP  participants reported use of therapeutics for COVID-19 during pregnancy for which  there is little safety information. Findings on COVID-19 pharmacotherapy  utilization patterns can guide future studies examining the safety of COVID-19  therapies during pregnancy.

AB  - A recent study reported that patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) are at increased risk of death from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, there  are no studies on the outcome of COVID-19 patients with preexisting ILD treated  with corticosteroids or antiviral drugs. We extracted 26 patients with  preexisting ILD by medical records and HRCT pattern. Of 503 patients with  COVID-19, we selected 52 patients as control matched for age and sex. Twenty out  of the 26 ILD patients (76.9%) received corticosteroid therapy, and 23 patients  (88.5%) also received antiviral treatment with remdesivir or favipiravir.  Although no statistical difference was found, the proportion of severe patients  in ILD group tended to be higher than in non-ILD group (23.1% vs. 42.3%;  p = 0.114). Also, mortality rate in ILD group tended to be higher than in non-ILD  patients (11.5% vs. 3.8%; p = 0.326). In univariate analysis to evaluate risk  factors for severe condition, diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, usual  interstitial pneumonia pattern, and honeycomb lung were not risk factors of  severe disease. Treatment with corticosteroids, antiviral drugs, and  immunosuppressive agents may affect the outcome of COVID-19 patients with ILD.

AB  - As remdesivir, the first FDA-approved drug for SARS-CoV-2 infection, can be used only for hospitalized patients due to intravenous administration, there is an  urgent need of effective oral antiviral formulations to be used at early stage of  infection in an outpatient setting. The present paper reports on the comparative  pharmacokinetics of the electrospun nanofiber remdesivir/sulfobutyl ether  beta-cyclodextrin formulation after intravenous and buccal administration. It was  postulated that oral transmucosal administration avoids remdesivir from metabolic  transformation and intact remdesivir can be detected in plasma, but only the  active metabolite GS-441524 could be experimentally detected at a significantly  lower plasma level, than that provided by the intravenous route. In buccally  treated animals, the metabolite GS-441524 appeared only at 1 h after treatment,  while in intravenously treated animals, GS-441524 was possible to quantify even  at the first time-point of blood collection. Further optimization of formulation  is required to improve pharmacokinetics of remdesivir-sulfobutyl ether  beta-cyclodextrin formulation upon buccal administration.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Remdesivir is an anti-viral drug that inhibits RNA polymerase. In 2020, remdesivir was recognized as the most promising therapeutic agents against  coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the effects of remdesivir on  cancers have hardly been studied. PURPOSE: Here, we reported that the  anti-carcinogenic effect of remdesivir on SKOV3 cells, one of human ovarian  cancer cell lines. RESEARCH DESIGN: We anlalyzed the anti-carcarcinogenic effect  of remdesivir in SKOV3 cells by performing in vitro cell assay and western  blotting. RESULTS: WST-1 showed that remdesivir decreased cell viability in SKOV3  cells. Experiments conducted by Muse Cell Analyzer showed that remdesivir-induced  apoptosis in SKOV3 cells. We found that the expression level of FOXO3, Bax, and  Bim increased, whereas Bcl-2, caspase-3, and caspase-7 decreased by remdesivir in  SKOV3 cells. Furthermore, we observed that intracellular reactive oxygen species  (ROS) level increased after treatment of remdesivir in SKOV3 cells.  Interestingly, cytotoxicity of remdesivir decreased after treatment of  N-Acetylcysteine. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our results demonstrated that  remdesivir has an anti-carcinogenic effect on SKOV3 cells vis up-regulation of  reactive oxygen species, which suggests that remdesivir could be a promising  reagent for treatment of ovarian cancer.

AB  - To date the optimal antiviral treatment against severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has not been proven; remdesivir is a promising drug with in vitro  activity against several viruses, but in COVID-19 the clinical results are  currently not definitive. In this retrospective observational study, we analyzed  the clinical outcomes (survival analysis, efficacy, and safety) in a group of  hospitalized patients with COVID-19 treated with remdesivir in comparison with a  control group of patients treated with other antiviral or supportive therapies.  We included 163 patients treated with remdesivir and 403 subjects in the control  group; the baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups; the mortality  rate was higher in the control group (24.8% vs. 2.4%, p < 0.001), the risk of  intensive care unit (ICU) admission was higher in the control group (17.8% vs.  9.8%, p = 0.008); hospitalization time was significantly lower in patients  treated with remdesivir (9.5 vs. 12.5 days, p < 0.001). The safety of remdesivir  was good and no significant adverse events were reported. In multivariate  analysis, the remdesivir treatment was independently associated with a 34% lower  mortality rate (odds ratio = 0.669; p = 0.014). In this analysis, the treatment  with remdesivir was associated with lower mortality, lower rate of ICU admission,  and shorter time of hospitalization. No adverse events were observed. This  promising antiviral treatment should also be confirmed by other studies.

T2  - Journal of clinical epidemiology
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate for coronavirus disease 2019 treatments without benefits in subsequent large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) how many of their  most-cited clinical studies had declared favorable results. STUDY DESIGN AND  SETTING: Scopus searches (December 23, 2021) identified articles on  lopinavir-ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, remdesivir, convalescent  plasma, colchicine, or interferon (index interventions) that represented clinical  trials and had >150 citations. Their conclusions were correlated with study  design features. The 10 most recent citations for the most-cited article on each  index intervention were examined on whether they were critical to the highly  cited study. Altmetric scores were also obtained. RESULTS: Forty eligible  articles of clinical studies had received >150 citations. Twenty of forty (50%)  had favorable conclusions and four were equivocal. Highly cited articles with  favorable conclusions were rarely RCTs (3/20), although those without favorable  conclusions were mostly RCTs (15/20, P = 0.0003). Only one RCT with favorable  conclusions had >160 patients. Citation counts correlated strongly with Altmetric  scores, especially news items. Only nine (15%) of 60 recent citations to the most  highly cited studies with favorable or equivocal conclusions were critical.  CONCLUSION: Many clinical studies with favorable conclusions for largely  ineffective coronavirus disease 2019 treatments are uncritically heavily cited  and disseminated. Early observational studies and small randomized trials may  cause spurious claims of effectiveness that get perpetuated.

AB  - GS-441524, the parent nucleoside of remdesivir, has been proposed to be effective against Covid-19 based on in vitro studies and studies in animals. However,  randomized clinical trials of the agent to treat Covid-19 have not been  conducted. Here, we evaluated GS-441524 for Covid-19 treatment based on studies  reporting pharmacokinetic parameters of the agent in mice, rats, cats, dogs,  monkeys, and the single individual in the first-in-human trial supplemented with  information about its activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome  coronavirus 2 and safety. A dosing interval of 8 h was considered clinically  relevant and used to calculate steady-state plasma concentrations of GS-441524.  These ranged from 0.27 to 234.41 μM, reflecting differences in species, doses,  and administration routes. Fifty percent maximal inhibitory concentrations of  GS-441524 against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ranged from  0.08 μM to above 10 μM with a median of 0.87 μM whereas concentrations required  to produce 90% of the maximal inhibition of the virus varied from 0.18 µM to more  than 20 µM with a median of 1.42 µM in the collected data. Most of these  concentrations were substantially lower than the calculated steady-state plasma  concentrations of the agent. Plasma exposures to orally administered GS-441524,  calculated after normalization of doses, were larger for dogs, mice, and rats  than cynomolgus monkeys and humans, probably reflecting interspecies differences  in oral uptake with reported oral bioavailabilities below 8.0% in cynomolgus  monkeys and values as high as 92% in dogs. Reported oral bioavailabilities in  rodents ranged from 12% to 57%. Using different presumptions, we estimated human  oral bioavailability of GS-441524 at 13% and 20%. Importantly, doses of GS-441524  lower than the 13 mg/kg dose used in the first-in-human trial may be effective  against Covid-19. Also, GS-441524 appears to be well-tolerated. In conclusion,  GS-441524 has potential for oral treatment of Covid-19.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Interest revolving around coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) reinfection is escalating rapidly. By definition, reinfection denotes severe  acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), PCR redetection, and  COVID-19 recurrence within three months of the initial symptoms. The main aim of  the current systematic review was to evaluate the features of COVID-19 relapse  patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For this study, we used a string of terms  developed by a skilled librarian and through a systematical search in PubMed, Web  of Science, and Embase for eligible studies. Clinical surveys of any type were  included from January 2019 to March 2021. Eligible studies consisted of two  positive assessments separated by a negative result via RT-PCR. RESULTS:  Fifty-four studies included 207 cases of COVID-19 reinfection. Children were less  likely to have COVID-19 relapse. However, the most patients were in the age group  of 20-40 years. Asthenia (66.6%), headache (66.6%), and cough (54.7%) were  prevalent symptoms in the first SARS-CoV-2 infection. Asthenia (62.9%), myalgia  (62.9%), and headache (61.1%) were most frequent in the second one. The most  common treatment options used in first COVID-19 infection were  lopinavir/ritonavir (80%), oxygen support (69.2%), and oseltamivir (66.6).  However, for the treatment of second infection, mostly antibiotics (100%),  dexamethasone (100%), and remdesivir (80%) were used. In addition, obesity  (32.5%), kidney failure (30.7%), and hypertension (30.1%) were the most common  comorbidities. Unfortunately, approximately 4.5% of patients died. CONCLUSION: We  found the potency of COVID-19 recurrence as an outstanding issue. This feature  should be regarded in the COVID-19 management. Furthermore, the first and second  COVID-19 are similar in clinical features. For clinically practical comparison of  the symptoms severity between two epochs of infection, uniform data of both are  required. We suggest that future studies undertake a homogenous approach to  establish the clinical patterns of the reinfection phenomena.

AB  - A 58-year-old man presented to us with a 1-week history of high-grade fever and progressive dry cough. Four weeks before his presentation, he was diagnosed with  COVID-19 infection and needed non-ICU hospital admission with no supplemental  oxygen requirements for 6 days and was treated with a 5-day course of remdesivir  and 3 weeks of dexamethasone. His steroid dose was commenced on dexamethasone  12 mg bid (four times the recommended dose) for 14 days and then gradually  tapered over the remaining 7 days. His history was unremarkable, except for  well-controlled asthma. He did not complain of any shortness of breath, weight  loss, or loss of appetite. He was never a smoker and denied any alcohol use.

AB  - Remdesivir was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of COVID -19 in hospitalized adult and pediatric patients. Application of  computational calculations for choosing the sensitive reagent in  spectrophotometric quantitative analysis is very limited. Computational and  theoretical studies were used for choosing the best acid dye for selective  visible spectrophotometric quantitative analysis of remdesivir. The calculations  were performed using Gaussian 03 software with the density functional theory  method using B3LYP/6-31G(d) basis set. The theoretical studies revealed that  bromophenol blue is a better match for remdesivir than other acid dyes due to the  higher calculated interaction energy. The proposed method was based on the  reaction of remdesivir with the computationally selected acid dye bromophenol  blue to form a yellow ion-pair complex. The spectra showed absorption peaks at  418 nm. Various factors affecting the reaction were optimized. The method was  successfully applied for the determination of remdesivir in the pharmaceutical  preparation with good accuracy and precision. Beer's law was observed in the  concentration range of 2-12 μg/mL of remdesivir. The proposed reaction was used  as a basis for the spectrophotometric determination of remdesivir in pure form  and in the pharmaceutical preparation.

AB  - The structure of a trinuclear zinc complex, hexakis(μ(2)-2-anilinobenzoato)diaquatrizinc(II),  [Zn(2)(C(13)H(10)NO(2))(6)(H(2)O)(2)] or (NPA)(6)Zn(3)(H(2)O)(2) (NPA is  2-anilinobenzoate or N-phenylanthranilate), is reported. The complex crystallizes  in the triclinic space group P-1 and the central Zn(II) atom is located on an  inversion center. The NPA ligand is found to coordinate via the carboxylate O  atoms with unique C-O bond lengths that support an unequal distribution of  resonance over the carboxylate fragment. The axial H(2)O ligands form hydrogen  bonds with neighboring molecules that stabilize the supramolecular system in  rigid straight chains, with an angle of 180° along the c axis. π stacking is the  primary stabilization along the a and b axes, resulting in a highly ordered  supramolecular structure. Docking studies show that this unique supramolecular  structure of a trinuclear zinc complex has potential for binding to the main  protease (M(pro)) in SARS-CoV-2 in a different location from Remdesivir, but with  a similar binding strength.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Remdesivir is not currently approved for patients with eGFR <30 ml/min per 1.73 m(2). We aimed to determine the safety of remdesivir in patients  with kidney failure. METHODS: This study was a retrospective cohort study of  patients with COVID-19 hospitalized between May 2020 and January 2021 with eGFR  <30 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) who received remdesivir and historical controls with  COVID-19 hospitalized between March 1, 2020 and April 30, 2020 prior to the  emergency use authorization of remdesivir within a large health care system.  Patients were 1:1 matched by propensity scores accounting for factors associated  with treatment assignment. Adverse events and hospital outcomes were recorded by  manual chart review. RESULTS: The overall cohort included 34 hospitalized  patients who initiated remdesivir within 72 hours of hospital admission with  eGFR<30 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) and 217 COVID-19 controls with eGFR <30 ml/min per  1.73 m(2). The propensity score-matched cohort included 31 remdesivir-treated  patients and 31 nonremdesivir-treated controls. The mean age was 74.0 (SD=13.8)  years, 57% were women, and 68% were white participants. A total of 26% had ESKD.  Among patients who were not on dialysis prior to initiating remdesivir, one  developed worsening kidney function (defined as ≥50% increase in creatinine or  initiation of KRT) compared with three in the historical control group. There was  no increased risk of cardiac arrythmia, cardiac arrest, altered mental status, or  clinically significant anemia or liver function test abnormalities. There was a  significantly increased risk of hyperglycemia, which may be partly explained by  the increased use of dexamethasone in the remdesivir-treated population.  CONCLUSIONS: In this propensity score-matched study, remdesivir was well  tolerated in patients with eGFR <30 ml/min per 1.73 m(2).

AB  - The aim of this report is to review the literature and shed light on the uncertainties surrounding the use of antiviral agents in general and remdesivir  in COVID-19 patients. This review evaluated a battery of antiviral compounds and  their effectiveness in the treatment of COVID-19 since the beginning of the  pandemic. Remdesivir is the only antiviral approved by the EMA and FDA for the  treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This work extensively reviews remdesivir data  generated from clinical trials and observational studies, paying attention to the  most recent data, and focusing on outcomes to give readers a more comprehensive  understanding of the results. This review also discusses the recommendations  issued by official bodies during the pandemic in the light of the current  knowledge. The use of remdesivir in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection is  justified because a virus is the causative agent that triggers the inflammatory  responses and its consequences. More trials are needed to improve the management  of this disease.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had grounded the world to a standstill. As the disease continues to rage two years on, it is apparent that  effective therapeutics are critical for a successful endemic living with  COVID-19. A dearth in suitable antivirals has prompted researchers and healthcare  professionals to investigate existing and developmental drugs against severe  acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although some of these  drugs initially appeared to be promising for the treatment of COVID-19, they were  ultimately found to be ineffective. In this review, we provide a retrospective  analysis on the merits and limitations of some of these drugs that were tested  against SARS-CoV-2 as well as those used for adjuvant therapy. While many of  these drugs are no longer part of our arsenal for the treatment of COVID-19,  important lessons can be learnt. The recent inclusion of molnupiravir and  Paxlovid™ as treatment options for COVID-19 represent our best hope to date for  endemic living with COVID-19. Our viewpoints on these two drugs and their  prospects as current and future antiviral agents will also be provided.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To evaluate the results of low-dose radiation therapy (LD-RT) to lungs in the management of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. MATERIAL  AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective phase I-II trial enrolling COVID-19  patients ≥50 years-old, with bilateral lung involvement at imaging study and  oxygen requirement (oxygen saturation ≤93% on room air). Patients received 1 Gy  to whole lungs in a single fraction. Primary outcome was a radiological response  assessed as severity and extension scores at days +3 and +7. Secondary outcomes  were toxicity (CTCAE v5.0), days of hospitalization, changes in inflammatory  blood parameters (ferritin, lymphocytes, C-reactive protein, d-dimer and LDH) and  SatO(2)/FiO(2) index (SAFI), at day +3 and +7. Descriptive analyses were  summarized as means with standard deviation (SD) and/or medians with  interquartile ranges (IQR). A Wilcoxon sign rank test for paired data was used to  assess the CT scores and Chi Square was used to assess for comparison of  categorical variables. RESULTS: Forty-one patients were included. Median age was  71 (IQR 60-84). Eighteen patients (44%) previously received an anti-COVID  treatment (tocilizumab, lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir) and thirty-two patients  (84%) received steroids during LD-RT. The extension score improved significantly  (p = 0.02) on day +7. Mean baseline extension score was 13.7 (SD ± 4.9) with a  score of 12.2 (±5.2) at day 3, and 12.4 ± 4.7 at day 7. No differences were found  in the severity score. SAFI improved significantly on day +3 and +7 (p < 0.01).  Median SAFI on day 0 was 147 (IQR 118-264), 230 (IQR 120-343) on day +3 and 293  (IQR 121-353) on day +7. Significant decrease was found in C-reactive protein on  day +7 (p = 0.02) and in lymphocytes counts on day +3 and +7 (p = 0.02). The  median number of days in hospital after RT was 11 (range 4-78). With a median  follow-up of 60 days after LD-RT, 26 (63%) patients were discharged, 11 (27%)  died because of COVID respiratory failure and 4 (10%) died of other causes.  CONCLUSIONS: LD-RT is a feasible and well-tolerated treatment that could lead to  rapid clinical improvement. Large randomized trials would be required to  establish the efficacy of LD-RT to treat COVID-19 pneumonia.

AB  - The ongoing global pandemic of COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2 has killed more than 5.9 million individuals out of ∼43 million confirmed infections. At present,  several parts of the world are encountering the 3rd wave. Mass vaccination has  been started in several countries but they are less likely to be broadly  available for the current pandemic, repurposing of the existing drugs has drawn  highest attention for an immediate solution. A recent publication has mapped the  physical interactions of SARS-CoV-2 and human proteins by affinity-purification  mass spectrometry (AP-MS) and identified 332 high-confidence SARS-CoV-2-human  protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Here, we taken a network biology approach  and constructed a human protein-protein interaction network (PPIN) with the above  SARS-CoV-2 targeted proteins. We utilized a combination of essential network  centrality measures and functional properties of the human proteins to identify  the critical human targets of SARS-CoV-2. Four human proteins, namely PRKACA,  RHOA, CDK5RAP2, and CEP250 have emerged as the best therapeutic targets, of which  PRKACA and CEP250 were also found by another group as potential candidates for  drug targets in COVID-19. We further found candidate drugs/compounds, such as  guanosine triphosphate, remdesivir, adenosine monophosphate, MgATP, and H-89  dihydrochloride that bind the target human proteins. The urgency to prevent the  spread of infection and the death of diseased individuals has prompted the search  for agents from the pool of approved drugs to repurpose them for COVID-19. Our  results indicate that host targeting therapy with the repurposed drugs may be a  useful strategy for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - AIMS: To perform network meta-analysis for a head-to-head comparison of various interventions used in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on mortality, clinical  recovery, time to clinical improvement and the occurrence of serious adverse  events. METHODS: Systematic search was performed using online databases with  suitable MeSH terms including coronavirus, COVID-19, randomized controlled trial,  hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, tocilizumab, remdesivir, favipiravir,  dexamethasone and interferon-β. Data were independently extracted by 2 study  investigators and analysed. RESULTS: Out of 1225 studies screened, 23 were  included for qualitative and quantitative analysis. Among the drugs studied,  dexamethasone reduces mortality by 10%, with a relative risk of 0.90 (95%  confidence interval [0.82-0.97]) and increases clinical recovery by 6% (relative  risk 1.06, 95% confidence interval [1.02-1.10]) compared to standard of care.  Similarly, remdesivir administered for 10 days increased clinical recovery by  10%, reduced time to clinical improvement by 4 days and lowered the occurrence of  serious adverse events by 27% as compared to standard of care. CONCLUSION: In  comparison to standard of care, dexamethasone was found to increase clinical  recovery and lower mortality; remdesivir was significantly associated with a  lower risk of mortality as compared to tocilizumab and higher clinical recovery  and shorter time to clinical improvement as compared to hydroxychloroquine and  tocilizumab; remdesivir followed by tocilizumab were found to have lesser  occurrence of serious adverse events in patients with moderate to severe  COVID-19.

AB  - Remdesivir has been shown to reduce recovery time and mortality among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, data regarding the efficacy  and safety of remdesivir use are limited in Japan. We conducted a single-center  retrospective cohort study at Yokohama Municipal Citizen's Hospital, Kanagawa,  Japan. Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia treated with remdesivir were included.  The onset of acute pancreatitis and increased pancreatic enzyme levels and  clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were collected and analyzed. A  total of 201 patients were included. Among the 201 patients treated with  remdesivir, 177 recovered from COVID-19. Increased pancreatic enzyme levels of  grade 3 or higher or acute pancreatitis developed in 23 of the 201 patients. The  potential etiopathogenetic effects of remdesivir on increased pancreatic enzyme  levels of grade 3 or higher or acute pancreatitis were ascertained by reviewing  the characteristics of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 who did not receive  remdesivir treatment. Only 3 of 159 patients had increased pancreatic enzyme  levels of grade 3 or higher during the treatment course. Multivariate analysis  indicated remdesivir administration and severe COVID-19 infection by National  Institute of Health standards as independent risk factors. Acute pancreatitis and  severe increases in pancreatic enzyme levels were observed among patients with  COVID-19 treated with remdesivir.

AB  - We extend our established agent-based multiscale computational model of infection of lung tissue by SARS-CoV-2 to include pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic  models of remdesivir. We model remdesivir treatment for COVID-19; however, our  methods are general to other viral infections and antiviral therapies. We  investigate the effects of drug potency, drug dosing frequency, treatment  initiation delay, antiviral half-life, and variability in cellular uptake and  metabolism of remdesivir and its active metabolite on treatment outcomes in a  simulated patch of infected epithelial tissue. Non-spatial deterministic  population models which treat all cells of a given class as identical can clarify  how treatment dosage and timing influence treatment efficacy. However, they do  not reveal how cell-to-cell variability affects treatment outcomes. Our  simulations suggest that for a given treatment regime, including cell-to-cell  variation in drug uptake, permeability and metabolism increase the likelihood of  uncontrolled infection as the cells with the lowest internal levels of antiviral  act as super-spreaders within the tissue. The model predicts substantial  variability in infection outcomes between similar tissue patches for different  treatment options. In models with cellular metabolic variability, antiviral doses  have to be increased significantly (>50% depending on simulation parameters) to  achieve the same treatment results as with the homogeneous cellular metabolism.

AB  - In the search for new anti-HIV-1 agents, two forms of phenylamino-phenoxy-quinoline derivatives have been synthesized, namely,  2-phenylamino-4-phenoxy-quinoline and 6-phenylamino-4-phenoxy-quinoline. In this  study, the binding interactions of phenylamino-phenoxy-quinoline derivatives and  six commercially available drugs (hydroxychloroquine, ritonavir, remdesivir,  S-217622, N3, and PF-07321332) with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus  2 (SARS-CoV-2) main protease (M(pro)) were investigated using molecular docking  and the ONIOM method. The molecular docking showed the hydrogen bonding and  hydrophobic interactions of all the compounds in the pocket of SARS-CoV-2 main  protease (M(pro)), which plays an important role for the division and  proliferation of the virus into the cell. The binding free energy values between  the ligands and M(pro) ranged from -7.06 to -10.61 kcal/mol. The molecular  docking and ONIOM results suggested that  4-(2',6'-dimethyl-4'-cyanophenoxy)-2-(4″-cyanophenyl)-aminoquinoline and  4-(4'-cyanophenoxy)-2-(4″-cyanophenyl)-aminoquinoline have low binding energy  values and appropriate molecular properties; moreover, both compounds could bind  to M(pro) via hydrogen bonding and Pi-Pi stacking interactions with amino acid  residues, namely, HIS41, GLU166, and GLN192. These amino acids are related to the  proteolytic cleavage process of the catalytic triad mechanisms. Therefore, this  study provides important information for further studies on synthetic quinoline  derivatives as antiviral candidates in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe COVID-19 in children and the differences between the two waves. METHODS: The electronic medical records of children younger than 16 y of  age with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection between June 1st 2020 and May  31st 2021 at Christian Medical College, Vellore were retrospectively reviewed.  Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected on a predesigned case  record form and analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 988 children were diagnosed with  confirmed COVID-19 during the study period. Of these, there were 585 children  diagnosed during the 1st wave (June 2020-Feb 2021) and 403 children during the  2nd wave (March 2021-May 2021). It was found that loose stools and rash were  significantly more frequent during the 1st wave and fever, cough, coryza, heart  rate and temperature were significantly more during the 2nd wave. There was no  significant difference between the two groups in terms of requirement of oxygen  therapy, need for ICU admission, duration of ICU stay or hospital stay, or  severity of illness. Mortality was significantly higher during the 2nd wave (0.3%  vs. 2%). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic among children during the 1st and 2nd  waves were similar in severity, though there was a higher mortality during the  2nd wave.

AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a Coronavirus in humans, namely SARS-CoV-2, which has quickly become a global pandemic. The infection is  responsible for a severe form of pneumonia, which may lead to lung failure and  death. Among the therapeutic strategies, the antiviral agent remdesivir has  become one of the most used drugs. The current literature reports a causal  correlation between remdesivir administration and the incidence of cardiovascular  effects. We aimed to further investigate this relationship, by exploring the  association between the use of remdesivir and the onset of bradyarrhythmic  disorders. METHODS: We reviewed medical records, blood exams and chest imaging of  85 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (M/F: 57/28, age: 61±12 years) admitted  between September 2020 and May 2021 to the Division of Respiratory Diseases in  Palermo, Italy. RESULTS: We found a significant correlation between treatment  with remdesivir and the occurrence of bradycardia, lasting for at least 3 days,  which returned to normal values after the discontinuation of the drug. A  significant reduction in heart rate (HR) was observed in the days following  remdesivir administration (L. ratio 47.4, P<0.0001) in 24 patients (HR on the  first day of observation: 75±14 bpm; at discharge: 72±14 bpm). Cardiac events  occurred more frequently in subjects with extensive pulmonary involvement  (greater than 50% of the total parenchyma, as assessed by chest CT). CONCLUSIONS:  We suggest to carefully monitor the administration of the drug in patients with  risk factors for arrhythmic or cardiovascular events.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread into more than 200  countries and infected approximately 203 million people globally. COVID-19 is  associated with high mortality and morbidity in some patients, and this disease  still does not have effective treatments with reproducibly appreciable outcomes.  One of the leading complications associated with COVID-19 is acute respiratory  distress syndrome (ARDS); this is an anti-viral host inflammatory response, and  it is usually caused by a cytokine storm syndrome which may lead to multi-organ  failure and death. Currently, COVID-19 patients are treated with approaches that  mostly fall into two major categories: immunomodulators, which promote the body's  fight against viruses efficiently, and antivirals, which slow or stop viruses  from multiplying. These treatments include a variety of novel therapies that are  currently being tested in clinical trials, including serum, IL-6 antibody, and  remdesivir; however, the outcomes of these therapies are not consistently  appreciable and remain a subject of debate. Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells  (MSCs), the multipotent stem cells that have previously been used to treat viral  infections and various respiratory diseases such as ARDS exhibit immunomodulatory  properties and can ameliorate tissue damage. Given that SARS-CoV-2 targets the  immune system and causes tissue damage, it is presumable that MSCs are being  explored to treat COVID-19 patients. This review summarizes the potential  mechanisms of action of MSC therapy, progress of MSC, and its related products in  clinical trials for COVID-19 therapy based on the outcomes of these clinical  studies.

AB  - The novel coronavirus SARS-coV-2, which emerged in Wuhan in November 2019, has increasingly spread, causing a global pandemic that infected more than 444  million people, resulting in severe social and economic ramifications, and  claimed more than 6,010,000 lives by March 5, 2022. The pandemic attracted global  attention with consequential multiple economic, social, and clinical studies.  Among causes of poor clinical outcomes of the disease are therapeutic challenges,  leading to spirals of studies in search of better therapeutic alternatives.  Despite the worsening circumstances of the pandemic, no drug has yet shown  remarkable efficacy in the clinical management of COVID-19 patients in  large-scale trials. Many potential therapeutic strategies, including the use of  nucleotide analogs, chloroquine phosphate, arbidol, protease inhibitors  (lopinavir/ritonavir), plasma, monoclonal antibodies, plastic antibodies based on  molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs), traditional Chinese medicine (TCM),  nanomaterials, vaccine, and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), have emerged with  various degrees of successes. Remdesivir and dexamethasone have now been licensed  based on the results of randomized controlled trials. Baricitinib, the Janus  kinase (JAK) 1/2 inhibitor, is also an attractive candidate due to its properties  as a potent anti-inflammatory agent and its hypothesized offtarget antiviral  effects against SARS-CoV-2. Besides, human plasma from recovered COVID-19  patients is theoretically expected to be safe and effective for both therapy and  post-exposure prophylaxis. In light of the literature, the correlation between  the reduction of C5aR1/C5aR2 and the IL6-IL6R axis, using the available anti-IL6R  mAb would be crucial. Moreover, MSCs are a potential therapeutic choice for  patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. The coronavirus spike (S) protein that mediates  the process of the infection via binding of host cells to the virus receptor is  an essential focus for vaccine development. Importantly, with the number of  patients increasing daily, there is an urgent need for effective therapeutic  intervention. In this review, we expatiated on several strategies deployed for  the treatment of COVID-19 infection.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: To investigate and quantify the risks of AKI and ALI associated with remdesivir use, given the underlying diseases of SARS-CoV-2  infection. METHODS: This self-controlled case series (SCCS) study was conducted  using electronic hospital records between 23 January 2020 and 31 January 2021 as  retrieved from the Hong Kong Hospital Authority which manages all  laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong. Outcomes of AKI and ALI were  defined using the KDIGO Guideline and Asia Pacific Association of Study of Liver  consensus guidelines. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) for AKI and ALI following the  administration of remdesivir (exposure) in comparison to a non-exposure period  were estimated using the conditional Poisson regression models. RESULTS: Of 860  COVID-19 patients administered remdesivir during hospitalisation, 334 (38.8%) and  137 (15.9%) had incident ALI and AKI, respectively. Compared with the baseline  period, both ALI and AKI risks were increased significantly during the  pre-exposure period (ALI: IRR = 6.169, 95% CI = 4.549-8.365; AKI: IRR = 7.074,  95% CI = 3.763-13.298) and remained elevated during remdesivir treatment.  Compared to the pre-exposure period, risks of ALI and AKI were not significantly  higher in the first 2 days of remdesivir initiation (ALI: IRR = 1.261, 95%  CI = 0.915-1.737; AKI: IRR = 1.261, 95% CI = 0.889-1.789) and between days 2 and  5 of remdesivir treatment (ALI: IRR = 1.087, 95% CI = 0.793-1.489; AKI:  IRR = 1.152, 95% CI = 0.821-1.616). CONCLUSION: The increased risks of AKI and  ALI associated with intravenous remdesivir treatment for COVID-19 may be due to  the underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection. The risks of AKI and ALI were elevated in  the pre-exposure period, yet no such increased risks were observed following  remdesivir initiation when compared to the pre-exposure period.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Remdesivir with dexamethasone and remdesivir with baricitinib are effective in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. However, there has  been few evidence regarding the efficacy of the combination of baricitinib,  remdesivir, and dexamethasone in hypoxic COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Consecutive  patients who required oxygen therapy at the time of admission and received  remdesivir and dexamethasone at Kishiwada City Hospital between March 1, 2021 and  May 31, 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 90 patients were  investigated, including 30 receiving a combination of remdesivir, dexamethasone,  and baricitinib (baricitinib group) and 60 receiving remdesivir and dexamethasone  (control group). The use of direct oral anticoagulants, the level of C-reactive  protein, and chest X-ray abnormalities were significantly higher in the  baricitinib group than in the control group. Patients in the baricitinib group  recovered a median of four days faster than those in the control group (median, 7  days vs. 11 days; Gray's test, p < 0.001). The recovery rate was 90.0% in the  baricitinib group and 63.3% in the control group (p = 0.011). Fine and Gray  regression analysis showed that adjusted rate ratio for recovery with the  baricitinib combination therapy was 5.26 (95% confidential interval, 1.99-13.9; p  < 0.001). The incidence of new onset of bacterial infection was 6.7% in the  baricitinib group and 16.7% in the control group (p = 0.324). CONCLUSIONS: Our  study suggests that the combination of baricitinib, dexamethasone, and remdesivir  is effective and tolerable in hypoxic patients with COVID-19.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic remains uncontrolled despite the rapid rollout of safe and effective severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus  2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines, underscoring the need to develop highly effective  antivirals. In the setting of waning immunity from infection and vaccination,  breakthrough infections are becoming increasingly common and treatment options  remain limited. In addition, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern,  with their potential to escape neutralization by therapeutic monoclonal  antibodies, emphasizes the need to develop second-generation oral antivirals  targeting highly conserved viral proteins that can be rapidly deployed to  outpatients. Here, we demonstrate the in vitro antiviral activity and in vivo  therapeutic efficacy of GS-621763, an orally bioavailable prodrug of GS-441524,  the parent nucleoside of remdesivir, which targets the highly conserved virus  RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. GS-621763 exhibited antiviral activity against  SARS-CoV-2 in lung cell lines and two different human primary lung cell culture  systems. GS-621763 was also potently antiviral against a genetically unrelated  emerging coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV). The  dose-proportional pharmacokinetic profile observed after oral administration of  GS-621763 translated to dose-dependent antiviral activity in mice infected with  SARS-CoV-2. Therapeutic GS-621763 administration reduced viral load and lung  pathology; treatment also improved pulmonary function in COVID-19 mouse model. A  direct comparison of GS-621763 with molnupiravir, an oral nucleoside analog  antiviral that has recently received EUA approval, proved both drugs to be  similarly efficacious in mice. These data support the exploration of GS-441524  oral prodrugs for the treatment of COVID-19.

AB  - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has incited a global health crisis.  Currently, there are limited therapeutic options for the prevention and treatment  of SARS-CoV-2 infections. We evaluated the antiviral activity of sulforaphane  (SFN), the principal biologically active phytochemical derived from  glucoraphanin, the naturally occurring precursor present in high concentrations  in cruciferous vegetables. SFN inhibited in vitro replication of six strains of  SARS-CoV-2, including Delta and Omicron, as well as that of the seasonal  coronavirus HCoV-OC43. Further, SFN and remdesivir interacted synergistically to  inhibit coronavirus infection in vitro. Prophylactic administration of SFN to  K18-hACE2 mice prior to intranasal SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly decreased  the viral load in the lungs and upper respiratory tract and reduced lung injury  and pulmonary pathology compared to untreated infected mice. SFN treatment  diminished immune cell activation in the lungs, including significantly lower  recruitment of myeloid cells and a reduction in T cell activation and cytokine  production. Our results suggest that SFN should be explored as a potential agent  for the prevention or treatment of coronavirus infections.

AB  - An under-representation of women and a lack of sex-specific analyses in COVID-19 trials has been suggested. However, the higher number of men than women who are  severely affected by COVID-19 and the restricted information in scientific  publications may have biased these suggestions. Therefore, we evaluated sex  proportionality and sex-specific efficacy and safety data in trials of COVID-19  treatments and vaccines using both publicly available regulatory documents and  confidential documents used by regulators in their review of medicinal products.  Included were two treatments (ie, remdesivir and dexamethasone) and four vaccines  (ie, BNT162b2 mRNA (BioNTech/Pfizer), mRNA-1273 (Moderna), ChAdOx1-S  (AstraZeneca) and Ad26.COV2-S (Janssen)) that received marketing authorisation by  the European Commission at the time of the study conduct. An under-representation  of women was shown in three of the nine data sets for one treatment (ie,  remdesivir), but the proportion of women included was representative in each of  the data sets for the other five products. This indicates that there is no  structural under-representation of women in the COVID-19 trials. Currently,  sex-specific efficacy data are available for five of the six assessed products  and sex-specific safety data are available for half of the products only. It is  important that this information will also be made available for the other  products. There are only small differences in efficacy and safety between men and  women which are likely to be of limited clinical relevance. Sex-specific efficacy  information can generally be found in the publicly available regulatory documents  other than the Summary of Product Characteristics, for which more awareness might  be required.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 remdesivir resistance mutations have been generated in vitro but have not been reported in patients receiving treatment with the antiviral agent. We  present a case of an immunocompromised patient with acquired B-cell deficiency  who developed an indolent, protracted course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Remdesivir  therapy alleviated symptoms and produced a transient virologic response, but her  course was complicated by recrudescence of high-grade viral shedding. Whole  genome sequencing identified a mutation, E802D, in the nsp12 RNA-dependent RNA  polymerase, which was not present in pre-treatment specimens. In vitro  experiments demonstrated that the mutation conferred a ~6-fold increase in  remdesivir IC(50) but resulted in a fitness cost in the absence of remdesivir.  Sustained clinical and virologic response was achieved after treatment with  casirivimab-imdevimab. Although the fitness cost observed in vitro may limit the  risk posed by E802D, this case illustrates the importance of monitoring for  remdesivir resistance and the potential benefit of combinatorial therapies in  immunocompromised patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of remdesivir on overall mortality, ICU mortality, and renal functional outcome in hospitalized  patients with COVID-19 who received kidney transplant. METHODS: We reviewed 165  patients with KTx hospitalized owing to COVID-19 between March 1, 2020, and May  31, 2021. A total of 38 patients with KTx received a 5-day RDV treatment, whereas  127 received standard of care (SOC). Overall and ICU mortality along with  functional outcome were assessed. RESULTS: The 2 groups had similar baseline  characteristics. RDV treatment was completed in all patients without any adverse  effects attributable to RDV. In terms of overall mortality, there was no  difference between the RDV and SOC groups (18% vs 23%, p >0.05), but the ICU  mortality was significantly reduced in the RDV group (39% vs 83%, p <0.05). RDV  seems to have no nephrotoxic effect on patients with KTx because there was no  difference in the incidence of AKI between RDV and SOC groups (50% vs 43%, p  >0.05), and the discharge eGFR values significantly improved in the RDV group  compared with the admission values (57 ± 23 vs 44 ± 22, p <0.05). CONCLUSION:  Five-day RDV treatment appears safe in KTx recipients, and without obvious  nephrotoxic effects. Also, RDV may decrease ICU mortality attributed to COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In March 2020, the World Health Organization announced a state of emergency due to the appearance of a pandemic caused by the  Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a severe acute respiratory syndrome, known as  Covid-19. Most governments chose to implement precautionary measures, e.g.,  physical distancing and use of protective devices, which can in part limit the  transmission of the virus. However, the healthcare system experienced numerous  structural problems in managing the Covid-19 patients given the limited human and  technical resources in critical areas, such as the intensive care units (ICUs).  Different therapeutic solutions should therefore be assessed, which can  potentially minimize the negative impact of the disease on patients, favoring  their recovery and optimizing healthcare resources. The objective of this study  is to simulate the impact of remdesivir treatment on the pandemic course in the  long term. METHODS: A forecasting model is designed to estimate how remdesivir  would impact the ICU capacity and the healthcare costs from the hospital  perspective when managing COVID-19 patients. This model is applied in the  Portuguese context with a 20-week projection starting on May 1st and concluding  on September 18th, 2021. The data inputs were carefully collected by consulting  different sources, such as published global literature, official governmental  reports, and available infectious diseases databases, i.e., Our World in Data,  Portuguese Ministry of Health, and experts' opinions. RESULTS: The model showed  that the introduction of remdesivir-based treatment in patients with Covid-19  pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen therapy generates a significant reduction  in both the number of ICU admissions and deaths, which would produce more than  €23 million in cost savings and avoid more than 261 ICUs admissions and 166  deaths. CONCLUSION: It is demonstrated that alternative treatments such as  remdesivir can reduce both the health burden for healthcare facilities, optimize  their management, and improve patients' clinical conditions. However, the model  is centered on Rt values, which cannot be generalized to the entire country;  hence, the results of this research should be considered as a "hypothetical  study".

AB  - OBJECTIVE: A possible benefit has been suggested for early treatment of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with remdesivir. The efficacy of this drug is  controversial and could significantly influence the efficiency in healthcare  systems. The objective is the methodological interpretation of subgroup analyzes  according to starting of remdesivir treatment with respect to symptom onset of  COVID-19. METHODS: A search in Pubmed® database was performed. Randomized  clinical trials (RCTs) with subgroup analysis regarding early and late use of  remdesivir were selected. All endpoints were assessed using two methodologies.  First methodology considered statistical interaction, pre-specification,  biological plausibility, and consistency of results. Second methodology was a  validated tool with preliminary questions to discard subset analysis without  relevant minimum conditions, and a checklist with recommendations for  applicability. RESULTS: A total of 54 results were found and five RCTs were  selected. According first methodology, consistent heterogeneity was only found in  time to clinical improvement and better clinical status score at day 15 for  patients with severe COVID-19 and <7 days of symptoms. About second methodology,  these results about early use of remdesivir may be applied to clinical practice  with caution. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a systematic search and application of an  established methodology for interpretation of subgroup analysis about early use  of remdesivir. Results in severe COVID-19 suggested that early use of remdesivir  provides a greater benefit in <7 days of symptoms for time to clinical  improvement and better clinical status score at day 15. Future studies could use  7-day cut-off of symptoms to evaluate remdesivir.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 has spread worldwide, leading the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a pandemic, on 11 March  2020. Variants of concern have appeared at regular intervals-Alpha, Beta, Gamma,  Delta, and now Omicron. Omicron variant, first identified in Botswana in November  2021, is rapidly becoming the dominant circulating variant. In this review, we  provide an overview regarding the molecular profile of the Omicron variant,  epidemiology, transmissibility, the impact on vaccines, as well as vaccine  escape, and finally, we report the pharmacological agents able to block the  endocellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 or to inhibit its viral replication. The Omicron  has more than 50 mutations, of which the spike protein has 26-35 amino acids  different from the original SARS-CoV-2 virus or the Delta, some of which are  associated with humoral immune escape potential and greater transmissibility.  Omicron has a significant growth advantage over Delta, leading to rapid spread  with higher incidence levels. The disease so far has been mild compared to the  Delta. The two vaccination doses offer little or no protection against Omicron  infection while the booster doses provide significant protection against mild  illness and likely offer even greater levels of protection against serious  illness. Recently, new oral antiviral agents such as molnupiravir and paxlovid  have been approved and represent important therapeutic alternatives to antiviral  remdesivir. In addition, monoclonal antibodies such as casirivimab/imdevimab bind  different epitopes of the spike protein receptor; is this class of drugs  effective against the Omicron variant? However, more research is needed to define  whether Omicron is indeed more infectious and whether the vaccines, monoclonal  antibodies, and antivirals currently available are effective.

T2  - Critical care (London, England)
AB  - Obesity is highly prevalent in hospitalized patients admitted with COVID-19. Evidence based guidelines are available for COVID-19-related therapies but dosing  information specific to patients with obesity is lacking. Failure to account for  the pharmacokinetic alterations that exist in this population can lead to  underdosing, and treatment failure, or overdosing, resulting in an adverse  effect. The objective of this manuscript is to provide clinicians with guidance  for making dosing decisions for medications used in the treatment of patients  with COVID-19. A detailed literature search was conducted for medications listed  in evidence-based guidelines from the National Institutes of Health with an  emphasis on pharmacokinetics, dosing and obesity. Retrieved manuscripts were  evaluated and the following prioritization strategy was used to form the decision  framework for recommendations: clinical outcome data > pharmacokinetic  studies > adverse effects > physicochemical properties. Most randomized  controlled studies included a substantial number of patients who were obese but  few had large numbers of patients more extreme forms of obesity. Pharmacokinetic  data have described alterations with volume of distribution and clearance but  this variability does not appear to warrant dosing modifications. Future studies  should provide more information on size descriptors and stratification of data  according to obesity and body habitus.

AB  - The palatine tonsils (hereinafter referred to as "tonsils") serve as a reservoir for viral infections and play roles in the immune system's first line of defense.  The aims of this study were to establish tonsil epithelial cell-derived organoids  and examine their feasibility as an ex vivo model for severe acute respiratory  syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The tonsil organoids successfully  recapitulated the key characteristics of the tonsil epithelium, including  cellular composition, histologic properties, and biomarker distribution. Notably,  the basal layer cells of the organoids express molecules essential for SARS-CoV-2  entry, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), transmembrane serine  protease 2 (TMPRSS2) and furin, being susceptible to the viral infection. Changes  in the gene expression profile in tonsil organoids revealed that 395 genes  associated with oncostatin M signaling and lipid metabolism were highly  upregulated within 72 h after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Notably, remdesivir  suppressed the viral RNA copy number in organoid culture supernatants and  intracellular viral protein levels in a dose-dependent manner. Here, we suggest  that tonsil epithelial organoids could provide a preclinical and translational  research platform for investigating SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and transmissibility  or for evaluating antiviral candidates.

T2  - Acta clinica Croatica
AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the late 2019 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causes a respiratory  disease which could put myasthenia gravis (MG) patients at a greater risk of  developing severe disease course, since infections and some drugs are a  well-recognized trigger of symptom exacerbation in MG patients. Out of ten most  commonly used past and present drugs used in COVID-19 treatment, two (quinolone  derivatives and azithromycin) are known to worsen MG symptoms, whereas another  two (tocilizumab and eculizumab) might have positive effect on MG symptoms.  Colchicine, remdesivir, lopinavir, ritonavir and favipiravir seem to be safe to  use, while data are insufficient for bamlanivimab, although it is also probably  safe to use. Considering MG treatment options in patients infected with  SARS-CoV-2, acetylcholine esterase inhibitors are generally safe to use with some  preliminary studies even demonstrating therapeutic properties in regard to  COVID-19. Corticosteroids are in general safe to use, even recommended in  specific circumstances, whereas other immunosuppressive medications  (mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, cyclosporine, methotrexate) are probably  safe to use. The only exception is rituximab since the resulting B cell depletion  can lead to more severe COVID-19 disease. Concerning plasmapheresis and  intravenous immunoglobulins, both can be used in COVID-19 while taking into  consideration thromboembolic properties of the former and hemodynamic  disturbances of the latter. As current data suggest, all known COVID-19 vaccines  are safe to use in MG patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: This Review discusses the potential drug interactions risk between Drugs used in treating COVID-19 infection and Drugs used in treating  comorbid conditions (Diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular illness). METHOD: Six  Databases were consulted a) Micromedex drug interaction b) Medicine complete.com  c) Liverpool Drug Interaction Group for COVID-19 therapies d) Epocrates e)  Medscape f) drugs.com. To acquire information on possible interaction effects  between drugs used for COVID-19 treatment such as atazanavir,  lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir, molnupiravir, paxlovid(nirmatrelvir/ritonavir),  dexamethasone, azithromycin, chloroquine, and FDA approved monoclonal antibodies  with primarily used antidiabetic drugs, antihypertensive drugs, and drugs acting  on the cardiovascular system. RESULTS: Potential interaction effects such as  worsening glycemic control were prominent with lopinavir/ritonavir and the  primarily used antidiabetic drugs, which needs dosage adjustment and close  monitoring. The risk of hypotension and irregular heart rhythm is the potential  interaction effects with concomitant use of drugs for COVID-19 treatment and  antihypertensive drugs. Caution is advised with drugs such as atazanavir and  lopinavir/ritonavir when concomitantly used in treating comorbid conditions.  Drugs such as remdesivir, molnupiravir, and some monoclonal antibodies are safer  in use with drugs used in treating the comorbid condition. CONCLUSIONS: Drug-drug  interaction remains one of the significant factors in altering the therapeutic  efficacy. Drugs used to manage comorbid conditions may influence the COVID-19  treatment with potential interaction effects. These enhance the view on safety  concerns about the drug interaction risk in managing COVID-19 infection in  patients with comorbid conditions. This primary evidence may concern preventing  potential or unintentional effects resulting from Drug-drug interaction,  Improving patient quality of life.

AB  - Experiments with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are limited by the need for biosafety level 3 (BSL3) conditions. A SARS-CoV-2  replicon system rather than an in vitro infection system is suitable for  antiviral screening since it can be handled under BSL2 conditions and does not  produce infectious particles. However, the reported replicon systems are  cumbersome because of the need for transient transfection in each assay. In this  study, we constructed a bacterial artificial chromosome vector (the replicon-BAC  vector) including the SARS-CoV-2 replicon and a fusion gene encoding Renilla  luciferase and neomycin phosphotransferase II, examined the antiviral effects of  several known compounds, and then established a cell line stably harboring the  replicon-BAC vector. Several cell lines transiently transfected with the  replicon-BAC vector produced subgenomic replicon RNAs (sgRNAs) and viral  proteins, and exhibited luciferase activity. In the transient replicon system,  treatment with remdesivir or interferon-β but not with camostat or favipiravir  suppressed the production of viral agents and luciferase, indicating that  luciferase activity corresponds to viral replication. VeroE6/Rep3, a stable  replicon cell line based on VeroE6 cells, was successfully established and  continuously produced viral proteins, sgRNAs and luciferase, and their production  was suppressed by treatment with remdesivir or interferon-β. Molnupiravir, a  novel coronavirus RdRp inhibitor, inhibited viral replication more potently in  VeroE6/Rep3 cells than in VeroE6-based transient replicon cells. In summary, our  stable replicon system will be a powerful tool for the identification of  SARS-CoV-2 antivirals through high-throughput screening.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The current article reviews the latest information on the epidemiology, clinical features, diagnostics, clinical management and prevention  of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). RECENT FINDINGS: Atypical pneumonia due  to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 emerged in December 2019 in a  market in Wuhan, China and rapidly evolved into a pandemic in March 2020. Viral  loads of patients with COVID-19 peak in the first week of illness around day 2-4  and hence there is very high-transmission potential causing community outbreaks.  Asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission is a hallmark of COVID-19. Several  variants of concern (VOC) have emerged over the last 2 years and Omicron is the  predominant variant in many countries. PCR is the standard diagnostic test while  rapid antigen test is a useful supplementary test. Serology tests provide  indirect evidence of infection 1 -2 weeks after the onset of symptoms.  Molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir are oral antiviral agents that may reduce the risk  of hospitalization and deaths if administered early to high-risk subjects.  Remdesivir, baricitinib, anti-IL-6 tocilizumab and dexamethasone are frequently  used for treatment of patients with respiratory failure. SUMMARY: COVID-19  pandemic progresses relentlessly with substantial morbidity and mortality  especially in unvaccinated subjects. Mass COVID-19 vaccinations are the most  important measure for control of the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - The Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Defense (JPEO-CBRND) began development of a broad-spectrum antiviral  countermeasure against deliberate use of high-consequence viral hemorrhagic  fevers (VHFs) in 2016. The effort featured comprehensive preclinical research,  including laboratory testing and rapid advancement of lead molecules into  nonhuman primate (NHP) models of Ebola virus disease (EVD). Remdesivir (GS-5734,  Veklury, Gilead Sciences) was the first small molecule therapeutic to  successfully emerge from this effort. Remdesivir is an inhibitor of RNA-dependent  RNA polymerase, a viral enzyme that is essential for viral replication. Its  robust potency and broad-spectrum antiviral activity against certain RNA viruses  including Ebola virus and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2  (SARS-CoV-2) led to its clinical evaluation in randomized, controlled trials  (RCTs) in human patients during the 2018 EVD outbreak in the Democratic Republic  of the Congo (DRC) and the ongoing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic  today. Remdesivir was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration  (FDA) for the treatment of COVID-19 requiring hospitalization. Substantial gaps  remain in improving the outcomes of acute viral infections for patients afflicted  with both EVD and COVID-19, including how to increase therapeutic breadth and  strategies for the prevention and treatment of severe disease. Combination  therapy that joins therapeutics with complimentary mechanisms of action appear  promising, both preclinically and in RCTs. Importantly, significant programmatic  challenges endure pertaining to a clear drug and biological product development  pathway for therapeutics targeting biodefense and emerging pathogens when human  efficacy studies are not ethical or feasible. For example, remdesivir's clinical  development was facilitated by outbreaks of Ebola and SARS-CoV-2; as such, the  development pathway employed for remdesivir is likely to be the exception rather  than the rule. The current regulatory licensure pathway for therapeutics  targeting rare, weaponizable VHF agents is likely to require use of FDA's  established Animal Rule (21 CFR 314.600-650 for drugs; 21 CFR 601.90-95 for  biologics). The FDA may grant marketing approval based on adequate and  well-controlled animal efficacy studies when the results of those studies  establish that the drug is safe and likely to produce clinical benefit in humans.  In practical terms, this is anticipated to include a series of rigorous,  well-documented, animal challenge studies, to include aerosol challenge, combined  with human safety data. While small clinical studies against naturally occurring,  high-consequence pathogens are typically performed where possible, approval for  the therapeutics currently under development against biodefense pathogens will  likely require the Animal Rule pathway utilizing studies in NHPs. We review the  development of remdesivir as illustrative of the effort that will be needed to  field future therapeutics against highly lethal, infectious agents.

AB  - Being highly transmissible, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has affected millions of people causing devastating global impact  and has also not slowed down even after vaccination. The emerges of new strains  has made more concerns than the original one. We need a new therapeutic approach  against the disease. Our comprehensive in silico study investigates dual herbal  combinatorial methanolic extracts of W. somnifera (W) alone and with P. emblica  (P) (W:P/1:4) , T. sinensis (T) (W:T/1:4), B. monnieri (B) (W:B/1:1), O.  basilicum (O) (W:O/1:4), A. racemosus (A) (W:A/4:1) for potential four  phytochemicals as ligands docked with eight COVID-19 Nonstructural proteins  (nsp)-main protease (PDB ID:6LU7), papain-like protease (6WUU), helicase ADP  (2XZL), N7-methyltransferase (5C8S), endoribonuclease (6WLC),  2'O-methyltransferase (6WVN), RNA dependent RNA polymerase (6M71), and 3Cprotease  (6YNQ) along with Remdesivir and Hydroxychloroquine. Ligands from W:P/1:4 showed  remarkable docking score (-9.01 kcal/mol)  6M71-(8E,11E,14E)-eicosa-8,11,14-trienoicacidmethylester (EIS) and  (-9.99 kcal/mol)  6YNQ-N-[(E)-[4-[(2-methoxydibenzofuran-3-yl)amino]-4-oxobutan-2-ylidene]amino]  4nitrobenzamide (MET). Further, MD simulations were studied for 100 ns and showed  the complexes were flexible, stable in the binding pockets of the receptors, and  MM-PBSA analysis determined high binding energy of -129.673 ± 15.284 and  -134.594 ± 7.085 for 6M71-EIS (Asn(496), Lys(577), Arg(569)) and 6YNQ-MET  (Cys(145), His(41)). Finally, in vitro JURKAT E6.1 cell lines treated with  W:P/1:4 and W:O/1:4 methanolic extracts yielded 44.06 and 31.53 ng/mL levels for  interferon alpha to counteract an external stimulus by establishing an antiviral  state. Thus, nsp is targeted to design effective antiviral drugs for developing  an effective therapeutic approach to combat viral RNA synthesis, processing, and  suppression of host immunity.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

AB  - Novel SARS coronavirus or SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus that was identified and spread from Wuhan in 2019. On January 30th, the World Health Organization  declared the coronavirus outbreak as a Global Public Health Emergency. Although  Remdesivir and Molnupiravir are FDA-approved drugs for COVID-19, finding new  efficient and low-cost antiviral drugs against COVID-19 for applying in more  countries can still be helpful. One of the potential sources for finding new and  low-cost drugs is the herbal compounds in addition to repurposing FDA-approved  drugs. So, in this study, we focused on finding effective drug candidates against  COVID-19 based on the computational approaches. As ACE2 serves as a critical  receptor for cell entry of this virus. Inhibiting the binding site of SARS-CoV-2  on human ACE2 provides a promising therapeutic approach for developing drugs  against SARS-CoV-2. Herein, we applied a bioinformatics approach to identify  possible potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2. A library of FDA-approved compounds  and five natural compounds was screened using Smina docking. Top-docking  compounds are then applied in Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation to assess the  stability of ACE2-inhibitor complexes. Results indicate that Luteolin and Chrysin  represent high conformation stability with ACE2 during 120 ns of Molecular  Dynamics simulation. The binding free energies of Luteolin and Chrysin were  calculated by the Molecular Mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area method  (MM/PBSA) which confirmed the relative binding free energy of these drugs to ACE2  in favor of the effective binding. So, Luteolin and Chrysin could sufficiently  interact with ACE2 and block the Spike binding pocket of ACE2 and can be a  potential inhibitor against the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 receptor which is  an early stage of infection. Luteolin and Chrysin could be suggestive as  beneficial compounds for preventing or reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and  infection which need experimental work to prove.

AB  - Corona Virus Disease-19 (COVID-19) is a pandemic disease mainly caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It had spread from Wuhan,  China, in late 2019 and spread over 222 countries and territories all over the  world. Earlier, at the very beginning of COVID-19 infection, there were no  approved medicines or vaccines for combating this disease, which adversely  affected a lot of individuals worldwide. Although frequent mutation leads to the  generation of more deadly variants of SARS-CoV-2, researchers have developed  several highly effective vaccines that were approved for emergency use by the  World Health Organization (WHO), such as mRNA-1273 by Moderna, BNT162b2 by  Pfizer/BioNTech, Ad26.COV2.S by Janssen, AZD1222 by Oxford/AstraZeneca,  Covishield by the Serum Institute of India, BBIBP-CorV by Sinopharm, coronaVac by  Sinovac, and Covaxin by Bharat Biotech, and the first US Food and Drug  Administration-approved antiviral drug Veklury (remdesivir) for the treatment of  COVID-19. Several waves of COVID-19 have already occurred worldwide, and  good-quality vaccines and medicines should be available for ongoing as well as  upcoming waves of the pandemic. Therefore, in silico studies have become an  excellent tool for identifying possible ligands that could lead to the  development of safer medicines or vaccines. Various phytoconstituents from plants  and herbs with antiviral properties are studied further to obtain inhibitors of  SARS-CoV-2. In silico screening of various molecular databases like PubChem,  ZINC, Asinex Biol-Design Library, and so on has been performed extensively for  finding effective ligands against targets. Herein, in silico studies carried out  by various researchers are summarized so that one can easily find the best  molecule for further in vitro and in vivo studies.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Early in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the M Health Fairview Hospital System established dedicated hospitals for establishing cohorts and caring for  patients with COVID-19, yet the association between treatment at  COVID-19-dedicated hospitals and mortality and complications is not known.  OBJECTIVE: To analyze the mortality rate and complications associated with  treatment at the COVID-19-dedicated hospitals. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS:  This retrospective cohort study evaluated data prospectively collected from March  1, 2020, through June 30, 2021, from 11 hospitals in Minnesota, including 2  hospitals created solely to care for patients with COVID-19. Data obtained  included demographic characteristics, treatments, and outcomes of interest for  all patients with a confirmed COVID-19 infection admitted to this hospital system  during the study period. EXPOSURES: Patients were grouped based on whether they  received treatment from 1 of the 2 COVID-19-dedicated hospitals compared with the  remainder of the hospitals within the hospital system. MAIN OUTCOMES AND  MEASURES: Multivariate analyses, including risk-adjusted logistic regression and  propensity score matching, were performed to evaluate the primary outcome of  in-hospital mortality and secondary outcomes, including complications and use of  COVID-specific therapeutics. RESULTS: There were 5504 patients with COVID-19  admitted during the study period (median age, 62.5 [IQR, 45.0-75.6] years; 2854  women [51.9%]). Of these, 2077 patients (37.7%) (median age, 63.4 [IQR,  50.7-76.1] years; 1080 men [52.0%]) were treated at 1 of the 2 COVID-19-dedicated  hospitals compared with 3427 (62.3%; median age, 62.0 [40.0-75.1] years; 1857  women (54.2%) treated at other hospitals. The mortality rate was 11.6% (n = 241)  at the dedicated hospitals compared with 8.0% (n = 274) at the other hospitals  (P < .001). However, risk-adjusted in-hospital mortality was significantly lower  for patients in the COVID-19-dedicated hospitals in both the unmatched group  (n = 2077; odds ratio [OR], 0.75; 95% CI, 0.59-0.95) and the propensity  score-matched group (n = 1317; OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.58-0.99). The rate of overall  complications in the propensity score-matched group was significantly lower (OR,  0.81; 95% CI, 0.66-0.99) and the use of COVID-19-specific therapeutics including  deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis (83.9% vs 56.9%; P < .001), high-dose  corticosteroids (56.1% vs 22.2%; P < .001), remdesivir (61.5% vs 44.5%;  P < .001), and tocilizumab (7.9% vs 2.0; P < .001) was significantly higher.  CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, COVID-19-dedicated hospitals had  multiple benefits, including providing high-volume repetitive treatment and  isolating patients with the infection. This experience suggests improved  in-hospital mortality for patients treated at dedicated hospitals owing to  improved processes of care and supports the use of establishing cohorts for  future pandemics.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To summarise specific adverse effects of remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We  searched 32 databases through 27 October 2020. We included randomised trials  comparing any of the drugs of interest to placebo or standard care, or against  each other. We conducted fixed-effects pairwise meta-analysis and assessed the  certainty of evidence using the grading of recommendations assessment,  development and evaluation approach. RESULTS: We included 16 randomised trials  which enrolled 8152 patients. For most interventions and outcomes the certainty  of the evidence was very low to low except for gastrointestinal adverse effects  from hydroxychloroquine, which was moderate certainty. Compared with standard  care or placebo, low certainty evidence suggests that remdesivir may not have an  important effect on acute kidney injury (risk difference (RD) 8 fewer per 1000,  95% CI 27 fewer to 21 more) or cognitive dysfunction/delirium (RD 3 more per  1000, 95% CI 12 fewer to 19 more). Low certainty evidence suggests that  hydroxychloroquine may increase the risk of cardiac toxicity (RD 10 more per  1000, 95% CI 0 more to 30 more) and cognitive dysfunction/delirium (RD 33 more  per 1000, 95% CI 18 fewer to 84 more), whereas moderate certainty evidence  suggests hydroxychloroquine probably increases the risk of diarrhoea (RD 106 more  per 1000, 95% CI 48 more to 175 more) and nausea and/or vomiting (RD 62 more per  1000, 95% CI 23 more to 110 more) compared with standard care or placebo. Low  certainty evidence suggests lopinavir/ritonavir may increase the risk of  diarrhoea (RD 168 more per 1000, 95% CI 58 more to 330 more) and nausea and/or  vomiting (RD 160 more per 1000, 95% CI 100 more to 210 more) compared with  standard care or placebo. DISCUSSION: Hydroxychloroquine probably increases the  risk of diarrhoea and nausea and/or vomiting and may increase the risk of cardiac  toxicity and cognitive dysfunction/delirium. Lopinavir/ritonavir may increase the  risk of diarrhoea and nausea and/or vomiting. Remdesivir may have no important  effect on risk of acute kidney injury or cognitive dysfunction/delirium. These  findings provide important information to support the development of  evidence-based management strategies for patients with COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The antiviral efficacy of remdesivir in COVID-19 hospitalized patients remains controversial. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the effect of remdesivir  in blocking viral replication. METHODS: We analysed nasopharyngeal normalized  viral loads from 665 hospitalized patients included in the DisCoVeRy trial  (NCT04315948; EudraCT 2020-000936-23), randomized to either standard of care  (SoC) or SoC + remdesivir. We used a mathematical model to reconstruct viral  kinetic profiles and estimate the antiviral efficacy of remdesivir in blocking  viral replication. Additional analyses were conducted stratified on time of  treatment initiation (≤7 or >7 days since symptom onset) or viral load at  randomization (< or ≥3.5 log10 copies/104 cells). RESULTS: In our model,  remdesivir reduced viral production by infected cells by 2-fold on average (95%  CI: 1.5-3.2-fold). Model-based simulations predict that remdesivir reduced time  to viral clearance by 0.7 days compared with SoC, with large inter-individual  variabilities (IQR: 0.0-1.3 days). Remdesivir had a larger impact in patients  with high viral load at randomization, reducing viral production by 5-fold on  average (95% CI: 2.8-25-fold) and the median time to viral clearance by 2.4 days  (IQR: 0.9-4.5 days). CONCLUSIONS: Remdesivir halved viral production, leading to  a median reduction of 0.7 days in the time to viral clearance compared with SoC.  The efficacy was larger in patients with high viral load at randomization.

AB  - Combinations of direct-acting antivirals are needed to minimize drug resistance mutations and stably suppress replication of RNA viruses. Currently, there are  limited therapeutic options against the severe acute respiratory syndrome  coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and testing of a number of drug regimens has led to  conflicting results. Here, we show that cobicistat, which is an FDA-approved drug  booster that blocks the activity of the drug-metabolizing proteins cytochrome  P450-3As (CYP3As) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp), inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication. Two  independent cell-to-cell membrane fusion assays showed that the antiviral effect  of cobicistat is exerted through inhibition of spike protein-mediated membrane  fusion. In line with this, incubation with low-micromolar concentrations of  cobicistat decreased viral replication in three different cell lines including  cells of lung and gut origin. When cobicistat was used in combination with  remdesivir, a synergistic effect on the inhibition of viral replication was  observed in cell lines and in a primary human colon organoid. This was consistent  with the effects of cobicistat on two of its known targets, CYP3A4 and P-gp, the  silencing of which boosted the in vitro antiviral activity of remdesivir in a  cobicistat-like manner. When administered in vivo to Syrian hamsters at a high  dose, cobicistat decreased viral load and mitigated clinical progression. These  data highlight cobicistat as a therapeutic candidate for treating SARS-CoV-2  infection and as a potential building block of combination therapies for  COVID-19. IMPORTANCE The lack of effective antiviral treatments against  SARS-CoV-2 is a significant limitation in the fight against the COVID-19  pandemic. Single-drug regimens have so far yielded limited results, indicating  that combinations of antivirals might be required, as previously seen for other  RNA viruses. Our work introduces the drug booster cobicistat, which is approved  by the FDA and typically used to potentiate the effect of anti-HIV protease  inhibitors, as a candidate inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 replication. Beyond its direct  activity as an antiviral, we show that cobicistat can enhance the effect of  remdesivir, which was one of the first drugs proposed for treatment of  SARS-CoV-2. Overall, the dual action of cobicistat as a direct antiviral and a  drug booster can provide a new approach to design combination therapies and  rescue the activity of compounds that are only partially effective in  monotherapy.

AB  - Although vaccines are currently used to control the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, treatment options are urgently needed for those who cannot  be vaccinated and for future outbreaks involving new severe acute respiratory  syndrome coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) strains or coronaviruses not covered by  current vaccines. Thus far, few existing antivirals are known to be effective  against SARS-CoV-2 and clinically successful against COVID-19. As part of an  immediate response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a high-throughput, high content  imaging-based SARS-CoV-2 infection assay was developed in VeroE6 African green  monkey kidney epithelial cells expressing a stable enhanced green fluorescent  protein (VeroE6-eGFP cells) and was used to screen a library of 5676 compounds  that passed Phase 1 clinical trials. Eight drugs (nelfinavir, RG-12915,  itraconazole, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, sematilide, remdesivir, and  doxorubicin) were identified as inhibitors of in vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity  in VeroE6-eGFP and/or Caco-2 cell lines. However, apart from remdesivir, toxicity  and pharmacokinetic data did not support further clinical development of these  compounds for COVID-19 treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Research suggests the protection offered by COVID-19 vaccines might wane over time, prompting consideration of booster vaccinations. Data on which  vaccines offer the most robust protection over time, and which patients are most  vulnerable to attenuating protection, could help inform potential booster  programmes. In this study, we used comprehensive hospitalisation data to estimate  vaccine effectiveness over time. METHODS: In this case-control study, we used  data from a large US health-care system to estimate vaccine effectiveness against  severe SARS-CoV-2 infection and examined variation based on time since  vaccination, vaccine type, and patients' demographic and clinical  characteristics. We compared trends in attenuation of protection across vaccines  and used a multivariable model to identify key factors associated with risk for  severe breakthrough infection. Patients were considered to have severe COVID-19  if they were admitted to the hospital, had a final coded diagnosis of COVID-19  (according to International Classification of Diseases Tenth Revision code U07.1)  or a positive nucleic acid amplification test for symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 during  their hospitalisation, and were treated with remdesivir or dexamethasone during  hospitalisation. FINDINGS: Between April 1, 2021, and Oct 26, 2021, we observed  9667 admissions for severe COVID-19 (ie, cases). Overall, 1293 (13·4%) of 9667  cases were fully vaccinated at the time of admission, compared with 22 308  (57·7%) of 38 668 controls, who were admitted to hospital for other reasons. The  median time between vaccination and hospital admission among cases was 162 days  (IQR 118-198). Overall vaccine effectiveness declined mostly over the course of  the summer, from 94·5% (95% CI 91·4-96·5) in April, 2021 (pre-delta), to 84·0%  (81·6-86·1) by October, 2021. Notably, vaccine effectiveness declined over time,  from 94·0% (95% CI 92·8-95·0) at days 50-100 after vaccination to 80·4%  (77·8-82·7) by days 200-250 after vaccination. After 250 days, vaccine  effectiveness declines were even more notable. Among those who received the  BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine, vaccine effectiveness fell from an initial  peak of 94·9% (93·2-96·2) to 74·1% (69·6-77·9) by days 200-250 after vaccination.  Protection from the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) and Ad26.COV2 (Janssen) vaccines declined  less over time, although the latter offered lower overall protection. Holding  other factors constant, the risk of severe breakthrough infection was most  strongly associated with age older than 80 years (adjusted odds ratio 1·76, 95%  CI 1·43-2·15), vaccine type (Pfizer 1·39, 0·98-1·97; Janssen 14·53, 8·43-25·03;  both relative to Moderna), time since vaccination (1·05, 1·03-1·07; per week  after week 8 when protection peaks, technically), and comorbidities including  organ transplantation (3·44, 95% CI 2·12-5·57), cancer (1·93, 1·60-2·33), and  immunodeficiency (1·49, 1·13-1·96). INTERPRETATION: Vaccination remains highly  effective against hospitalisation, but vaccine effectiveness declined after 200  days, particularly for older patients or those with specific comorbidities.  Additional protection (eg, a booster vaccination) might be warranted for  everyone, but especially for these populations. In addition to promoting general  vaccine uptake, clinicians and policy makers should consider prioritising booster  vaccinations in those most at risk of severe COVID-19. FUNDING: None.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Remdesivir is approved for the treatment of adults hospitalized with COVID-19. PURPOSE: To update a living review of remdesivir for adults with  COVID-19. DATA SOURCES: Several electronic U.S. Food and Drug Administration,  company, and journal websites from 1 January 2020 through 19 October 2021. STUDY  SELECTION: English-language, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of remdesivir  for COVID-19. DATA EXTRACTION: One reviewer abstracted, and a second reviewer  verified data. The Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and GRADE (Grading of  Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) method were used. DATA  SYNTHESIS: Since the last update (search date 9 August 2021), 1 new RCT and 1 new  subtrial comparing a 10-day course of remdesivir with control (placebo or  standard care) were identified. This review summarizes and updates the evidence  on the cumulative 5 RCTs and 2 subtrials for this comparison. Our updated results  confirm a 10-day course of remdesivir, compared with control, probably results in  little to no mortality reduction (5 RCTs). Updated results also confirm that  remdesivir probably results in a moderate increase in the proportion of patients  recovered by day 29 (4 RCTs) and may reduce time to clinical improvement (2 RCTs)  and hospital length of stay (4 RCTs). New RCTs, by increasing the strength of  evidence, lead to an updated conclusion that remdesivir probably results in a  small reduction in the proportion of patients receiving ventilation or  extracorporeal membrane oxygenation at specific follow-up times (4 RCTs). New  RCTs also alter the conclusions for harms-remdesivir, compared with control, may  lead to a small reduction in serious adverse events but may lead to a small  increase in any adverse event. LIMITATION: The RCTs differed in definitions of  COVID-19 severity and outcomes reported. CONCLUSION: In hospitalized adults with  COVID-19, the findings confirm that remdesivir probably results in little to no  difference in mortality and increases the proportion of patients recovered.  Remdesivir may reduce time to clinical improvement and may lead to small  reductions in serious adverse events but may result in a small increase in any  adverse event.

AB  - Despite the development of specific therapies against severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the continuous investigation of the mechanism of  action of clinically approved drugs could provide new information on the  druggable steps of virus-host interaction. For example, chloroquine  (CQ)/hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) lacks in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 in  TMPRSS2-expressing cells, such as human pneumocyte cell line Calu-3, and  likewise, failed to show clinical benefit in the Solidarity and Recovery clinical  trials. Another antimalarial drug, mefloquine, which is not a 4-aminoquinoline  like CQ/HCQ, has emerged as a potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 antiviral in vitro and  has also been previously repurposed for respiratory diseases. Here, we  investigated the anti-SARS-CoV-2 mechanism of action of mefloquine in cells  relevant for the physiopathology of COVID-19, such as Calu-3 cells (that  recapitulate type II pneumocytes) and monocytes. Molecular pathways modulated by  mefloquine were assessed by differential expression analysis, and confirmed by  biological assays. A PBPK model was developed to assess mefloquine's optimal  doses for achieving therapeutic concentrations. Mefloquine inhibited SARS-CoV-2  replication in Calu-3, with an EC(50) of 1.2 µM and EC(90) of 5.3 µM. It reduced  SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels in monocytes and prevented virus-induced enhancement of  IL-6 and TNF-α. Mefloquine reduced SARS-CoV-2 entry and synergized with  Remdesivir. Mefloquine's pharmacological parameters are consistent with its  plasma exposure in humans and its tissue-to-plasma predicted coefficient points  suggesting that mefloquine may accumulate in the lungs. Altogether, our data  indicate that mefloquine's chemical structure could represent an orally available  host-acting agent to inhibit virus entry.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, has wreaked havoc across the globe for the last two years. More than 300 million cases and over 5  million deaths later, we continue battling the first real pandemic of the 21st  century. SARS-CoV-2 spread quickly, reaching most countries within the first half  of 2020, and New Zealand was not an exception. Here, we describe the first  isolation and characterization of SARS-CoV-2 variants during the initial virus  outbreak in New Zealand. Patient-derived nasopharyngeal samples were used to  inoculate Vero cells and, three to four days later, a cytopathic effect was  observed in seven viral cultures. Viral growth kinetics was characterized using  Vero and VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells. The identity of the viruses was verified by  RT-qPCR, Western blot, indirect immunofluorescence assays, and electron  microscopy. Whole-genome sequences were analyzed using two different yet  complementary deep sequencing platforms (MiSeq/Illumina and Ion PGM™/Ion  Torrent™), classifying the viruses as SARS-CoV-2 B.55, B.31, B.1, or B.1.369  based on the Pango Lineage nomenclature. All seven SARS-CoV-2 isolates were  susceptible to remdesivir (EC(50) values from 0.83 to 2.42 µM) and  β-D-N(4)-hydroxycytidine (molnupiravir, EC(50) values from 0.96 to 1.15 µM) but  not to favipiravir (>10 µM). Interestingly, four SARS-CoV-2 isolates, carrying  the D614G substitution originally associated with increased transmissibility,  were more susceptible (2.4-fold) to a commercial monoclonal antibody targeting  the spike glycoprotein than the wild-type viruses. Altogether, this seminal work  allowed for early access to SARS-CoV-2 isolates in New Zealand, paving the way  for numerous clinical and scientific research projects in the country, including  the development and validation of diagnostic assays, antiviral strategies, and a  national COVID-19 vaccine development program.

AB  - An escalating pandemic caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has severely impacted global health. There is a severe  lack of specific treatment options for diseases caused by SARS-CoV-2. In this  study, we used a pseudotype virus (pv) containing the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein  to screen a botanical drug library containing 1037 botanical drugs to identify  agents that prevent SARS-CoV-2 entry into the cell. Our study identified four  hits, including angeloylgomisin O, schisandrin B, procyanidin, and oleanonic  acid, as effective SARS-CoV-2 S pv entry inhibitors in the micromolar range. A  mechanistic study revealed that these four agents inhibited SARS-CoV-2 S pv entry  by blocking spike (S) protein-mediated membrane fusion. Furthermore,  angeloylgomisin O and schisandrin B inhibited authentic SARS-CoV-2 with a high  selective index (SI; 50% cytotoxic concentration/50% inhibition concentration).  Our drug combination studies performed in cellular antiviral assays revealed that  angeloylgomisin O has synergistic effects in combination with remdesivir, a drug  widely used to treat SARS-CoV-2-mediated infections. We also showed that two hits  could inhibit the newly emerged alpha (B.1.1.7) and beta (B.1.351) variants. Our  findings collectively indicate that angeloylgomisin O and schisandrin B could  inhibit SARS-CoV-2 efficiently, thereby making them potential therapeutic agents  to treat the coronavirus disease of 2019.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic continues to threaten healthcare systems worldwide due to the limited access to vaccines, suboptimal treatment options, and the continuous  emergence of new and more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants. Reverse-genetics  studies of viral genes and mutations have proven highly valuable in advancing  basic virus research, leading to the development of therapeutics. We developed a  functional and highly versatile full-length SARS-CoV-2 infectious system by  cloning the sequence of a COVID-19 associated virus isolate (DK-AHH1) into a  bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC). Viruses recovered after RNA-transfection  of in vitro transcripts into Vero E6 cells showed growth kinetics and remdesivir  susceptibility similar to the DK-AHH1 virus isolate. Insertion of reporter genes,  green fluorescent protein, and nanoluciferase into the ORF7 genomic region led to  high levels of reporter activity, which facilitated high throughput treatment  experiments. We found that putative coronavirus remdesivir resistance-associated  substitutions F480L and V570L-and naturally found polymorphisms A97V, P323L, and  N491S, all in nsp12-did not decrease SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility to remdesivir. A  nanoluciferase reporter clone with deletion of spike (S), envelope (E), and  membrane (M) proteins exhibited high levels of transient replication, was  inhibited by remdesivir, and therefore could function as an efficient  non-infectious subgenomic replicon system. The developed SARS-CoV-2  reverse-genetics systems, including recombinants to modify infectious viruses and  non-infectious subgenomic replicons with autonomous genomic RNA replication, will  permit high-throughput cell culture studies-providing fundamental understanding  of basic biology of this coronavirus. We have proven the utility of the systems  in rapidly introducing mutations in nsp12 and studying their effect on the  efficacy of remdesivir, which is used worldwide for the treatment of COVID-19.  Our system provides a platform to effectively test the antiviral activity of  drugs and the phenotype of SARS-CoV-2 mutants.

AB  - IMPORTANCE AND OBJECTIVE: The aim of this pragmatic, embedded, adaptive trial was to measure the effectiveness of the subcutaneous anti-IL-6R antibody sarilumab,  when added to an evolving standard of care (SOC), for clinical management of  inpatients with moderate to severe COVID-19 disease. DESIGN: Two-arm, randomized,  open-label controlled trial comparing SOC alone to SOC plus sarilumab. The trial  used a randomized play-the-winner design and was fully embedded within the  electronic health record (EHR) system. SETTING: 5 VA Medical Centers.  PARTICIPANTS: Hospitalized patients with clinical criteria for moderate to severe  COVID-19 but not requiring mechanical ventilation, and a diagnostic test positive  for SARS-CoV-2. INTERVENTIONS: Sarilumab, 200 or 400 mg subcutaneous injection.  SOC was not pre-specified and could vary over time, e.g., to include antiviral or  other anti-inflammatory drugs. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome  was intubation or death within 14 days of randomization. All data were extracted  remotely from the EHR. RESULTS: Among 162 eligible patients, 53 consented, and 50  were evaluated for the primary endpoint of intubation or death. This occurred in  5/20 and 1/30 of participants in the sarilumab and SOC arms respectively, with  the majority occurring in the initial 9 participants (3/4 in the sarilumab and  1/5 in the SOC) before the sarilumab dose was increased to 400 mg and before  remdesivir and dexamethasone were widely adopted. After interim review, the  unblinded Data Monitoring Committee recommended that the study be stopped due to  concern for safety: a high probability that rates of intubation or death were  higher with addition of sarilumab to SOC (92.6%), and a very low probability  (3.4%) that sarilumab would be found to be superior. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE:  This randomized trial of patients hospitalized due to respiratory compromise from  COVID-19 but not mechanical ventilation found no benefit from subcutaneous  sarilumab when added to an evolving SOC. The numbers of patients and events were  too low to allow definitive conclusions to be drawn, but this study contributes  valuable information about the role of subcutaneous IL-6R inhibition in the  treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Methods developed and piloted during  this trial will be useful in conducting future studies more efficiently.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mucormycosis can lead to fatal rhinocerebral infection. CASE: A 53-year-old male with diabetes presented with altered mental status. He had been  recently discharged from an admission for COVID-19 pneumonia treated with  remdesivir and methylprednisolone. Imaging demonstrated a large left frontal mass  with midline shift suspicious for a primary brain neoplasm. His neurologic exam  rapidly declined and the patient was taken to the operating room for  decompressive hemicraniectomy. Post-operatively, the patient remained comatose  and failed to improve. Autopsy revealed a cerebral mucormycosis infection.  DISCUSSION: Despite concern for a primary brain neoplasm the patient was  diagnosed postmortem with a mucormycosis infection. Other features supporting  this diagnosis included nasal sinusitis on initial scans, his fulminant clinical  decline, rapidly progressive imaging findings, and persistent hyperglycemia  throughout his clinical course. CONCLUSION: In an era of high steroid usage to  treat COVID-19, mucormycosis infection must be considered in high-risk patients  demonstrating disproportionate clinical decline.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: COVID-19 is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This study aims to synthesize evidence to assess the cost-effectiveness of remdesivir  (RDV) for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in England and  Wales. METHODS: A probabilistic cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted  informed by 2 large trials and uses a partitioned survival approach to assess  short- and long-term clinical consequences and costs associated with COVID-19 in  a hypothetical cohort of hospitalized patients requiring supplemental oxygen at  the start of treatment. Given that it is uncertain whether RDV reduces death, 2  analyses are presented, assuming RDV either reduces death or does not. Published  sources were used for long-term clinical, quality of life, and cost parameters.  RESULTS: Under the assumption that RDV reduces death, the incremental  cost-effectiveness ratio for RDV is estimated at £11 881 per quality-adjusted  life-year gained compared with standard of care (SoC) (probabilistic incremental  cost-effectiveness ratio £12 400). The probability for RDV to be cost-effective  is 74% at a willingness-to-pay threshold of £20 000 per quality-adjusted  life-year gained. RDV was no longer cost-effective when the hazard ratio for  overall survival compared with SoC was >0·915. CONCLUSIONS: Results from this  study suggest that using RDV for the treatment of hospitalized patients with  COVID-19 is likely to represent a cost-effective use of National Health Service  resources at current willingness-to-pay threshold in England and Wales, only if  it prevents death. Results needs to be interpreted caution as vaccination was  introduced and the SoC and evidence available have also evolved considerably  since the analysis is conducted.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an unprecedented event requiring frequent adaptation to  changing clinical circumstances. Convalescent immune plasma (CIP) is a promising  treatment that can be mobilized rapidly in a pandemic setting. We tested whether  administration of SARS-CoV-2 CIP at hospital admission could reduce the rate of  ICU transfer or 28-day mortality or alter levels of specific antibody responses  before and after CIP infusion. In a single-arm phase II study, patients  >18 years-old with respiratory symptoms with confirmed COVID-19 infection who  were admitted to a non-ICU bed were administered two units of CIP within 72 h of  admission. Levels of SARS-CoV-2 detected by PCR in the respiratory tract and  circulating anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers were sequentially measured before and  after CIP transfusion. Twenty-nine patients were transfused high titer CIP and 48  contemporaneous comparable controls were identified. All classes of antibodies to  the three SARS-CoV-2 target proteins were significantly increased at days 7 and  14 post-transfusion compared with baseline (P < 0.01). Anti-nucleocapsid IgA  levels were reduced at day 28, suggesting that the initial rise may have been due  to the contribution of CIP. The groups were well-balanced, without statistically  significant differences in demographics or co-morbidities or use of remdesivir or  dexamethasone. In participants transfused with CIP, the rate of ICU transfer was  13.8% compared to 27.1% for controls with a hazard ratio 0.506 (95% CI  0.165-1.554), and 28-day mortality was 6.9% compared to 10.4% for controls,  hazard ratio 0.640 (95% CI 0.124-3.298). IMPORTANCE Transfusion of high-titer CIP  to non-critically ill patients early after admission with COVID-19 respiratory  disease was associated with significantly increased anti-SARS-CoV-2 specific  antibodies (compared to baseline) and a non-significant reduction in ICU transfer  and death (compared to controls). This prospective phase II trial provides a  suggestion that the antiviral effects of CIP from early in the COVID-19 pandemic  may delay progression to critical illness and death in specific patient  populations. This study informs the optimal timing and potential population of  use for CIP in COVID-19, particularly in settings without access to other  interventions, or in planning for future coronavirus pandemics.

AB  - Remdesivir (RDV) reduces time to clinical improvement in hospitalized COVID -19 patients requiring supplemental oxygen. Dexamethasone improves survival in those  requiring oxygen support. Data is lacking on the efficacy of combination therapy  in patients on mechanical ventilation. We analyzed for comparative outcomes  between Corticosteroid (CS) therapy with combined Corticosteroid and Remdesivir  (CS-RDV) therapy. We conducted an observational cohort study of patients aged 18  to 90 with COVID-19 requiring ventilatory support using TriNetX (COVID-19  Research Network) between January 20, 2020, and February 9, 2021. We compared  patients who received at least 48 hours of CS-RDV combination therapy to CS  monotherapy. The primary outcome was 28-day all-cause mortality rates in  propensity-matched (PSM) cohorts. Secondary outcomes were Length of Stay (LOS),  Secondary Bacterial Infections (SBI), and MRSA (Methicillin-Resistant  Staphylococcus aureus), and Pseudomonas infections. We used univariate and  multivariate Cox proportional hazards models and stratified log-rank tests. Of  388 patients included, 91 (23.5%) received CS-RDV therapy, and 297 (76.5%)  received CS monotherapy. After propensity score matching, with 74 patients in  each cohort, all-cause mortality was 36.4% and 29.7% in the CS-RDV and CS  therapy, respectively (P = 0.38). We used a Kaplan-Meier with a log-rank test on  follow up period (P = 0.23), and a Hazards Ratio model (P = 0.26). SBI incidence  was higher in the CS group (13.5% vs. 35.1%, P = 0.02) with a similar LOS (13.4  days vs. 13.4 days, P = 1.00) and similar incidence of MRSA/Pseudomonas  infections (13.5% vs. 13.5%, P = 1.00) in both the groups. Therefore, CS-RDV  therapy is non-inferior to CS therapy in reducing 28-day all-cause in-hospital  mortality but associated with a significant decrease in the incidence of SBI in  critically ill COVID-19 patients.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 has an exonuclease-based proofreader, which removes nucleotide inhibitors such as Remdesivir that are incorporated into the viral RNA during  replication, reducing the efficacy of these drugs for treating COVID-19.  Combinations of inhibitors of both the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and the  exonuclease could overcome this deficiency. Here we report the identification of  hepatitis C virus NS5A inhibitors Pibrentasvir and Ombitasvir as SARS-CoV-2  exonuclease inhibitors. In the presence of Pibrentasvir, RNAs terminated with the  active forms of the prodrugs Sofosbuvir, Remdesivir, Favipiravir, Molnupiravir  and AT-527 were largely protected from excision by the exonuclease, while in the  absence of Pibrentasvir, there was rapid excision. Due to its unique structure,  Tenofovir-terminated RNA was highly resistant to exonuclease excision even in the  absence of Pibrentasvir. Viral cell culture studies also demonstrate significant  synergy using this combination strategy. This study supports the use of  combination drugs that inhibit both the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase and exonuclease for  effective COVID-19 treatment.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Many antiviral agents, such as hydroxychloroquine, have been used to treat COVID-19, without being broadly accepted. QTc prolongation is a  worrisome adverse effect, scarcely studied in pediatrics. PATIENTS AND METHODS:  Paediatric patients affected from COVID-19 who received antivirals were matched  (1:2) with controls not infected nor exposed. Electrocardiograms were  prospectively analyzed at baseline, during the first 72 h of treatment and after  72 h. RESULTS: Eleven (22.9%) out of 48 patients admitted due to COVID-19  (March-July 2020) received antiviral therapy. All had underlying diseases:  congenital heart disease (4/11; 36.4%) and immunosuppression (3/11; 27.3%) stand  out. 5/11 (45.5%) received treatment at baseline with a potential effect on QTc.  There where no differences observed in the baseline QTc between cases and  controls: 414.8 ms (49.2) vs 416.5 ms (29.4), (P = .716). Baseline long QT was  observed in 2/11 cases and 2/22. Among cases, 10/11 (90.9%) received  hydroxychloroquine, mainly associated with azithromycin (8/11; 72.7%), 3 received  lopinavir/ritonavir and one remdesivir. The median increase in QTc after 72 h  under treatment was 28.9 ms [IQR 48.7] (P = .062). 4/11 (36.4%) patients had a  long QTc at 72 h, resulting in 3 patients ≥500 ms; treatment was stopped in one  (QTc 510 ms) but ventricular arrhythmias were not documented. CONCLUSIONS: The  use of antivirals caused an increase on the QTc interval after 72 h of treatment,  being the QTc long in 36.3% of the patients, although no arrhythmic events were  observed. The use of hydroxychloroquine and antivirals requires active QTc  monitoring and it is recommended to discontinue treatment if QTc > 500 ms.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of remdesivir in the early stage of nonsevere COVID-19. Although several randomized controlled trials have compared  the effectiveness of remdesivir with that of a placebo, there is limited evidence  regarding its effect in the early stage of nonsevere COVID-19 cases. METHODS: We  evaluated the effectiveness of remdesivir in the early stage of nonsevere  COVID-19 using the COVID-19 Registry Japan, a nationwide registry of hospitalized  patients with COVID-19 in Japan. Two regimens ("start remdesivir" therapy within  4 days from admission versus no remdesivir during hospitalization) among patients  without the need for supplementary oxygen therapy were compared by a 3-step  processing (cloning, censoring, and weighting) method. The primary outcome was a  supplementary oxygen requirement during hospitalization. Secondary outcomes were  30-day in-hospital mortality and the risk of invasive mechanical ventilation or  extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (IMV/ECMO). The data of 12,487 cases met our  inclusion criteria. The "start remdesivir" regimen showed a lower risk of  supplementary oxygen requirement (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.850, 95% confidence  interval [CI]: 0.798-0.906, p value < 0.001). Both 30-day in-hospital mortality  and risk of IMV/ECMO introduction were not significantly different between the 2  regimens (HRs: 1.04 and 0.983, 95% CI: 0.980-1.09 and 0.906-1.07, p values: 0.210  and 0.678, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Remdesivir might reduce the risk of oxygen  requirement during hospitalization in the early stage of COVID-19; however, it  had no positive effect on the clinical outcome and reduction in IMV/ECMO  requirement.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the completeness and currency of published systematic reviews of remdesivir for COVID-19 and to compare this with a living guidelines  approach. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: In this cross-sectional study, we searched  Europe PMC on May 20, 2021 for systematic reviews of remdesivir (including  preprints, living review updates). Completeness and currency were based on the  inclusion of four major randomized trials of remdesivir available at the time of  publication of the review (including as preliminary results and preprints).  RESULTS: We included 38 reviews (45 reports), equivalent to a new publication  every 9 days. 23 (51%) reports were out of date at the time of publication.  Eleven reviews that were current on publication had a median survival time of 10  days (range 4-57). A third of reviews cited other systematic reviews, but only  four provided justifications for why another review was necessary. Eight (21%) of  the reviews were registered in PROSPERO. The Australian COVID-19 Clinical  Evidence Taskforce living guidelines were updated within 14 days for three of the  remdesivir trials, and within 28 days for the fourth. CONCLUSION: There was  considerable duplication of systematic reviews of remdesivir, and half were  already out of date at the time of publication.

AB  - The purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of using potential drugs: remdesivir and glucocorticoid in treating children and  adolescents with COVID-19 and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in treating  MIS-C. We searched seven databases, three preprint platform, ClinicalTrials.gov,  and Google from December 1, 2019, to August 5, 2021, to collect evidence of  remdesivir, glucocorticoid, and IVIG which were used in children and adolescents  with COVID-19 or MIS-C. A total of nine cohort studies and one case series study  were included in this systematic review. In terms of remdesivir, the  meta-analysis of single-arm cohort studies have shown that after the treatment,  54.7% (95%CI, 10.3 to 99.1%) experienced adverse events, 5.6% (95%CI, 1.2 to  10.1%) died, and 27.0% (95%CI, 0 to 73.0%) needed extracorporeal membrane  oxygenation or invasive mechanical ventilation. As for glucocorticoids, the  results of the meta-analysis showed that the fixed-effect summary odds ratio for  the association with mortality was 2.79 (95%CI, 0.13 to 60.87), and the  mechanical ventilation rate was 3.12 (95%CI, 0.80 to 12.08) for glucocorticoids  compared with the control group. In terms of IVIG, most of the included cohort  studies showed that for MIS-C patients with more severe clinical symptoms, IVIG  combined with methylprednisolone could achieve better clinical efficacy than IVIG  alone. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the current evidence in the included studies is  insignificant and of low quality. It is recommended to conduct high-quality  randomized controlled trials of remdesivir, glucocorticoids, and IVIG in children  and adolescents with COVID-19 or MIS-C to provide substantial evidence for the  development of guidelines. WHAT IS KNOWN: • The efficacy and safety of using  potential drugs such as remdesivir, glucocorticoid, and intravenous  immunoglobulin (IVIG) in treating children and adolescents with COVID-19/MIS-C  are unclear. WHAT IS NEW: • Overall, the current evidence cannot adequately  demonstrate the effectiveness and safety of using remdesivir, glucocorticoids,  and IVIG in treating children and adolescents with COVID-19 or MIS-C. • We are  calling for the publication of high-quality clinical trials and provide  substantial evidence for the development of guidelines.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of remdesivir, the first novel therapeutic to receive Emergency Use Authorization for the  treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and identify key drivers of  value to guide future pricing and reimbursement efforts. METHODS: A Markov model  evaluated the cost-effectiveness of remdesivir in patients hospitalized with  COVID-19 from a US healthcare sector perspective. A lifetime time horizon  captured potential long-term costs and outcomes. Model outcomes included  discounted total costs, life-years, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).  Remdesivir was modeled as an addition to standard of care and compared with  standard of care alone, including dexamethasone for patients requiring  respiratory support. COVID-19 hospitalizations were assumed to be reimbursed  through a single payment based on the respiratory support received alongside a  remdesivir carveout payment in the base case. Sensitivity and scenario analyses  identified key drivers. RESULTS: At a unit price of $520 per vial and assuming no  survival benefit with remdesivir, the incremental cost-effectiveness was  $298 200/QALY for patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 and $1 847 000/QALY  for patients with mild COVID-19. Although current data do not support a survival  benefit, if one was assumed, the cost-effectiveness estimate was $50 100/QALY for  the moderate to severe population and $103 400/QALY for the mild population.  Another key driver included the hospitalization payment structure (per diem vs  bundled payment). CONCLUSIONS: With the current evidence available, remdesivir's  price is too high to align with its expected health gains for hospitalized  patients with COVID-19. Results from this study provide a rationale for iterative  health technology assessment.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Remdesivir was originally developed to treat Ebola hemorrhagic fever, and its efficacy in treating coronavirus disease 2019 was detected during  a preliminary analysis of a randomized controlled trial. It is known that Severe  Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 is not transmitted through human milk,  but data about the presence of remdesivir in human milk have been lacking. MAIN  ISSUE: In this case study, we determined the human milk-to-serum drug  concentration ratio and the relative dose of Remdesivir in one participant.  MANAGEMENT: The participant, a 28-year-old primipara, was found to have  Coronavirus 2 infection in 2019, 2 days after delivery. She was given Remdesivir.  The Remdesivir concentration in maternal serum and human milk was measured, and  the milk-to-serum drug concentration ratio was found to be low (0.089), as was  the relative infant dose (0.0070). The participant could not breastfeed her  infant during her Coronavirus 2 infection treatment because in Japan anyone with  COVID-19 was completely quarantined. However, she was able to resume  breastfeeding after discharge and breastfed her infant for 6 months with  supplements. CONCLUSION: Given the low amount of Remdesivir in the participant's  milk, the inclusion of antibodies to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome  Coronavirus 2, which can be expected to protect the infant from infection, and  various other benefits of human milk, suggests that breastfeeding is safe during  treatment with Remdesivir.

AB  - Corticosteroids are widely used to treat severe COVID-19, but in immunocompromised individuals, who are susceptible to persistent infection, long  term corticosteroid use may delay viral clearance. We present a case of prolonged  SARS-CoV-2 infection in a man with significantly impaired B-cell immunity due to  non-Hodgkin lymphoma which had been treated with rituximab. SARS-CoV-2 shedding  persisted, despite treatment with remdesivir. Viral sequencing confirmed the  persistence of the same viral strain, ruling out the possibility of reinfection.  Although SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgA and IgM remained negative throughout the treatment  period, after reduction of the corticosteroid dose, PCR became negative.  Long-term corticosteroid treatment, especially in immunocompromised individuals,  may result in suppression of cell-mediated immunity and prolonged SARS-CoV-2  infection.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: As healthcare systems continue to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, cost-effectiveness evidence will be needed to identify which tests and treatments  for COVID-19 offer value for money. We sought to review economic evaluations of  diagnostic tests and treatments for COVID-19, critically appraising the  methodological approaches used and reporting cost-effectiveness estimates, using  a "living" systematic review approach. METHODS: Key databases (including MEDLINE,  EconLit, Embase) were last searched on July 12, 2021. Gray literature and model  repositories were also searched. Only full economic evaluations published in  English were included. Studies were quality assessed and data were extracted into  standard tables. Results were narratively summarized. The review was completed by  2 reviewers independently, with disagreements resolved through discussion with a  senior reviewer. RESULTS: Overall, 3540 records were identified, with 13 meeting  the inclusion criteria. After quality assessment, 6 were excluded because of very  severe limitations. Of the 7 studies included, 5 were cost-utility analyses and 2  were cost-effectiveness analyses. All were model-based analyses. A total of 5  evaluated treatments (dexamethasone, remdesivir, hypothetical) and 2 evaluated  hypothetical testing strategies. Cost-effectiveness estimates were sensitive to  the treatment effect on survival and hospitalization, testing speed and accuracy,  disease severity, and price. CONCLUSIONS: Presently, there are few economic  evaluations for COVID-19 tests and treatments. They suggest treatments that  confer a survival benefit and fast diagnostic tests may be cost effective.  Nevertheless, studies are subject to major evidence gaps and take inconsistent  analytical approaches. The evidence may improve for planned updates of this  "living" review.

AB  - SBECD (Captisol®) with an average degree of substitution of 6.5 sulfobutylether functional groups (SBE = 6.5), is a solubility enhancer for remdesivir (RDV) and  a major component in Veklury, which was approved by FDA for the treatment of  patients with COVID-19 over 12 years old and weighing over 40 kg who require  hospitalization. SBECD is cleared mainly by renal filtration, thus, potential  accumulation of SBECD in the human body is a concern for patients dosed with  Veklury with compromised renal function. An LC-MS/MS method was developed and  validated for specific, accurate, and precise determination of SBECD  concentrations in human plasma. In this method, the hexa-substituted species,  SBE6, was selected for SBECD quantification, and the mass transition from its  dicharged molecular ion [(M-2H)/2](2-), Molecular (parent) Ion (Q1)/Molecular  (parent) Ion (Q3) of m/z 974.7/974.7, was selected for quantitative analysis of  SBECD. Captisol-G (SBE-γ-CD, SBE = 3) was chosen as the internal standard. With  25 µL of formic-acid-treated sample and with a calibration range of  10.0-1000 µg/mL, the method was validated with respect to pre-established  criteria based on regulatory guidelines and was applied to determine SBECD levels  in plasma samples collected from pediatric patients during RDV clinical studies.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to describe the changes in the intensive care burden of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during the first year of outbreak  in Japan. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included COVID-19 patients who  received mechanical ventilation (MV) support in two designated hospitals for  critical patients in Kawasaki City. We compared the lengths of MV and stay in the  intensive care unit (ICU) or high care unit (HCU) according to the three epidemic  waves. We calculated in-hospital mortality rates in patients with or without MV.  RESULTS: The median age of the sample was 65.0 years, and 22.7% were women. There  were 37, 29, and 62 patients in the first (W1), second (W2), and third waves  (W3), respectively. Systemic steroids, remdesivir, and prone positioning were  more frequent in W2 and W3. The median length of MV decreased from 18.0 days in  W1 to 13.0 days in W3 (P = 0.019), and that of ICU/HCU stay decreased from 22.0  days in W1 to 15.5 days in W3 (P = 0.027). The peak daily number of patients  receiving MV support was higher at 18 patients in W1, compared to 8 and 15  patients in W2 and W3, respectively. The mortality rate was 23.4%, which did not  significantly change (P = 0.467). CONCLUSIONS: The lengths of MV and ICU/HCU stay  per patient decreased over time. Despite an increase in the number of COVID-19  patients who received MV in W3, this study may indicate that the intensive care  burden during the study period did not substantially increase.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dexamethasone is standard of care for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 requiring oxygen. The objective is to assess the clinical benefit of  adding remdesivir to dexamethasone. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort  study of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia requesting low-flow oxygen  who received dexamethasone. Patients admitted to infectious diseases wards also  received remdesivir. Primary outcome was duration of hospitalization after oxygen  initiation. Secondary outcomes were in-hospital death, and death and/or transfer  to the intensive care unit. To handle potential confounding by indication bias,  outcome comparison was performed on propensity score-matched populations.  Propensity score was estimated by a multivariable logistic model including  prognostic covariates; then 1:1 matching was performed without replacement, using  the nearest neighbor algorithm with a caliper of 0.10 fold the standard deviation  of the propensity score as the maximal distance. Balance after matching was  checked on standardized mean differences. RESULTS: From August 15th 2020, to  February 28th, 2021, 325 patients were included, 101 of whom received remdesivir.  At admission median time from symptoms onset was 7 days, median age: 68 years,  male sex; 61%, >1 comorbidity: 58.5%. Overall 180 patients matched on propensity  score were analyzed, 90 each received remdesivir plus dexamethasone or  dexamethasone alone. Median duration of hospitalization was 9 (IQR: 7-13) and 9  (IQR: 5-18) days with and without remdesivir, respectively (p = 0.37).  In-hospital death rates and rates of transfer to the intensive care unit or death  were 8.9 and 17.8% (HR: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.21-1.02, p = 0.06) and 20.0 and 35.6%  with and without remdesivir, respectively (HR: 0.45, 95% CI: 0.23-0.89, p =  0.015). CONCLUSION: In hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia receiving  low-flow oxygen and dexamethasone, the addition of remdesivir was not associated  with shorter hospitalization or lower in-hospital mortality but may have reduced  the combined outcome of death and transfer to the intensive care unit.

AB  - COVID-19 pandemic is the biggest epidemiologic problem of the 21st century. A severe course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is rare. Sometimes, especially  in patients with chronic disease, COVID-19 may be insidious and life-threatening.  This article presents the course of COVID-19 in a 17-year-old boy with  Friedreich's ataxia-induced hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Although, the main  symptoms of COVID-19 (i.e., fever, cough) were moderate at the beginning of the  illness, the patient's condition deteriorated rapidly due to cardiac problems,  atrial fibrillation, and heart failure. The patient required antiarrhythmic  treatment and pharmacological and electrical cardioversion. Moreover, because of  pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen, remdesivir and convalescent plasma  therapy was given to the patient., The administration of the antiviral treatment  was crucial to the patient's recovery.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 first struck New York City in the spring of 2020, resulting in an unprecedented strain on our healthcare system and triggering  multiple changes in public health policy governing hospital operations as well as  therapeutic approaches to COVID-19. We examined inpatient mortality at our centre  throughout the course of the pandemic. METHODS: This is a retrospective chart  review of clinical characteristics, treatments and outcome data of all patients  admitted with COVID-19 from 1 March 2020 to 28 February 2021. Patients were  grouped into 3-month quartiles. Hospital strain was assessed as per cent of  occupied beds based on a normal bed capacity of 1491. RESULTS: Inpatient  mortality decreased from 25.0% in spring to 10.8% over the course of the year.  During this time, use of remdesivir, steroids and anticoagulants increased; use  of hydroxychloroquine and other antibiotics decreased. Daily bed occupancy ranged  from 62% to 118%. In a multivariate model with all year's data controlling for  demographics, comorbidities and acuity of illness, percentage of bed occupancy  was associated with increased 30-day in-hospital mortality of patients with  COVID-19 (0.7% mortality increase for each 1% increase in bed occupancy; HR  1.007, CI 1.001 to 1.013, p=0.004) CONCLUSION: Inpatient mortality from COVID-19  was associated with bed occupancy. Early reduction in epicentre hospital bed  occupancy to accommodate acutely ill and resource-intensive patients should be a  critical component in the strategic planning for future pandemics.

AB  - Although COVID-19 has impacted many children, severe disease is rare and most recover with supportive care. Manifestations are diverse and often  nonrespiratory. Adolescents/children with medical comorbidities are at risk for  severe respiratory compromise. The most serious manifestation in previously  healthy children is a delayed multisystem inflammatory syndrome with cardiac  compromise in severe cases. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies are available  for adolescents at risk of progression and not hospitalized. Therapeutic options  for severe respiratory disease with hypoxia include remdesivir and  glucocorticoids. Therapies for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children  include intravenous immunoglobulin and glucocorticoids. Refractory cases may  benefit from additional immunomodulators.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To ascertain the composite maternal and neonatal outcomes in pregnant individuals with moderate, severe, or critical coronavirus disease 2019  (COVID-19) treated with remdesivir. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a secondary  analysis of the COVID in Pregnancy Registry in Houston, Texas. Women were  included if they met the criteria of moderate, severe or critical COVID-19  illness. Composite adverse maternal outcome was defined as any of the following  outcomes: placental abruption, pregnancy-related hypertension, chorioamnionitis,  stroke, delivery with estimated blood loss >1000 mL, diagnosis of pulmonary  embolism or deep venous thromboembolism, or maternal death. Composite adverse  neonatal outcome was defined as any of the following: Apgar score ≤3 at 5 min,  arterial cord pH <7.0, positive SAR-CoV-2 test, intraventricular hemorrhage,  periventricular leukomalacia, stillbirth, or neonatal death. Comparative analyses  between participants receiving remdesivir versus those not exposed were  performed. RESULTS: A total of 994 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19  infection. Of these, 95 (9.6%) met criteria for moderate, severe, or critical  disease. Forty-one percent of these patients (n = 39) received remdesivir.  Baseline demographic characteristics were not different between groups. No  patients reported an allergic reaction with the administration of remdesivir;  however, 16.7% of the patients had the medication discontinued due to  transaminitis. Patients receiving the drug were more likely to have a longer  illness duration on admission, more likely to require oxygen support on arrival  and have a longer hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS: Remdesivir appears to be safe, well  tolerated within our cohort with no cases of recorded adverse reaction.

AB  - The human population is still facing appalling conditions due to several outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus.  The absence of specific drugs, appropriate vaccines for mutants, and knowledge of  potential therapeutic agents makes this situation more difficult. Several 1, 2,  4-triazolo [1, 5-a] pyrimidine (TP)-derivative compounds were comprehensively  studied for antiviral activities against RNA polymerase of HIV, HCV, and  influenza viruses, and showed immense pharmacological interest. Therefore,  TP-derivative compounds can be repurposed against the RNA-dependent RNA  polymerase (RdRp) protein of SARS-CoV-2. In this study, a meta-analysis was  performed to ensure the genomic variability and stability of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp  protein. The molecular docking of natural and synthetic TP compounds to RdRp and  molecular dynamic (MD) simulations were performed to analyse the dynamic  behaviour of TP compounds at the active site of the RdRp protein. TP compounds  were also docked against other non-structural proteins (NSP1, NSP2, NSP3, NSP5,  NSP8, NSP13, and NSP15) of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the inhibition potential of  TP compounds was compared with Remdesivir and Favipiravir drugs as a positive  control. Additionally, TP compounds were analysed for inhibitory activity against  SARS-CoV RdRp protein. This study demonstrates that TP analogues (monomethylated  triazolopyrimidine and essramycin) represent potential lead molecules for  designing an effective inhibitor to control viral replication. Furthermore, in  vitro and in vivo studies will strengthen the use of these inhibitors as suitable  drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - COVID-19 has spread around the world and caused serious public health and social problems. Although several vaccines have been authorized for emergency use, new  effective antiviral drugs are still needed. Some repurposed drugs including  Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine and Remdesivir were immediately used to treat  COVID-19 after the pandemic. However, the therapeutic effects of these drugs have  not been fully demonstrated in clinical studies. In this paper, we found an  antimalarial drug, Naphthoquine, showed good broad-spectrum anti-coronavirus  activity. Naphthoquineinhibited HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV-2 replication  in vitro, with IC(50) = 2.05 ± 1.44 μM, 5.83 ± 0.74 μM, and 2.01 ± 0.38 µM,  respectively. Time-of-addition assay was also performed to explore at which stage  Naphthoquine functions during SARS-CoV-2 replication. The results suggested that  Naphthoquine may influence virus entry and post-entry replication. Considering  the safety of Naphthoquine was even better than that of Chloroquine, we think  Naphthoquine has the potential to be used as a broad-spectrum drug for  coronavirus infection.

AB  - BACKGROUND Physicians worldwide have been reporting many cases of COVID-19-induced pulmonary fibrosis. We report the case of a 51-year-old Filipino  asthmatic woman who developed post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis subsequently  treated with Nintedanib. CASE REPORT The patient presented with a 4-day history  of flu-like symptoms in September 2020 and was eventually diagnosed with severe  COVID-19 pneumonia. Despite receiving Dexamethasone, Tocilizumab, Remdesivir, and  multiple antibiotics, there was increasing oxygen requirement, necessitating ICU  admission and high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC). An additional course of  hydrocortisone was given due to asthma exacerbation, gradually liberating her  from the HFNC. A chest CT scan showed extensive parenchymal changes, for which  she received methylprednisolone and physical rehabilitation with persistence of  respiratory symptoms. After 40 days of hospitalization, she was sent home on  oxygen support and Nintedanib. The patient initially had severe dyspnea (Borg  Scale 7) with 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) of 295 meters. Pulmonary function  showed moderately severe restrictive lung defect at 52% predicted total lung  capacity (TLC) and severely reduced DLCO (28% predicted). Chest CT scoring  indicated severe lung involvement. One month after Nintedanib treatment, her Borg  Scale improved to 4. Her 6MWD, TLC, and DLCO increased to 434 meters, 64%  predicted, and 36% predicted, respectively. A chest CT scan showed regressing  fibrosis. After 6 months of treatment, her pulmonary function normalized. DLCO  remained moderately reduced (59% predicted) but her 6MWD (457 meters) and CT scan  results continued to improve. CONCLUSIONS Nintedanib, along with other  interventions, may have potentially improved pulmonary function and CT scan  findings in a COVID-19 survivor with pulmonary fibrosis 6 months after treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Since the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a widespread use of remdesivir in adults and children. There is little known information about  remdesivir's role in reducing 30-day readmissions after hospitalization with  COVID-19. This study aimed to determine whether treatment with remdesivir was  associated with reduced risk of 30-day readmission after index hospitalization  with COVID-19. METHODS: The study was a multi-center cohort study in Rhode  Island, USA. Patients included all adults that were discharged after hospital  treatment for COVID-19 between April 1(st) and December 31(st), 2020. The main  study outcomes were length of hospital stay, 30-day readmission, and  post-discharge 30 days mortality. RESULTS: A total of 2,062 patients (2,279  hospitalizations) were included in the analytic sample. Patients were less likely  to be readmitted within 30 days if they received remdesivir relative to not  receiving remdesivir; associations were strongest for those with mild disease  (RR: 0.31; 95% CI: 0.13,0.75). Remdesivir treatment was associated with reduction  in all-cause mortality (HR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.49,0.85) and an increase in length of  stay (estimated average increase of 3.27 days; 95% CI: 2.11,4.44). LIMITATION:  Unmeasured factors such as time-to-treatment and severity of disease prior to  initiation of remdesivir. CONCLUSIONS: Remdesivir may be an effective strategy  for reducing progression to severe COVID-19 disease and limiting morbidity  associated with readmission to hospital. Larger prospective studies are justified  to study the role of remdesivir in mild or early COVID-19 with high risk of  disease progression and readmission to hospital within 30 days.

AB  - Coronaviruses have caused enough devastation in the last two decades. These viruses have some rare features while sharing some common features. Novel  coronavirus disease (nCoV-19) caused an outbreak with a fatality rate of 5%. It  emerged from China and spread into many countries. The present research focused  on genome analysis of Indian nCoV-19 Isolate and its translational product  subjected to homology modeling and its subsequent molecular simulations to find  out potent FDA approved drug for treating COVID-19. Phylogenetic analysis of  SARS-CoV-2 Indian isolate shows close resemblance with 17 countries SARS-CoV-2  isolates. Homology modeling of four non-structural proteins translational product  of Indian SARS-CoV-2 genome shows high similarity and allowed regions with the  existing PDB deposited SARS-CoV-2 target proteins. Finally, these four generated  proteins show more affinity with cobicistat, remdesivir and indinavir out of 14  screened FDA approved drugs in molecular docking which is further proven by  molecular dynamics simulation and MMGBSA analysis of target ligand complex with  best simulation trajectories. Overall our present research findings is that three  proposed drugs namely cobicistat, remdesivir and indinavir showed higher  interaction with the model SARS-CoV-2 viral target proteins from the Indian  nCoV-19 isolate. These compounds could be used as a starting point for the  creation of active antiviral drugs to combat the deadly COVID-19 virus during  global pandemic and its subsequent viral infection waves across the  globe.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical characteristics, laboratory parameters, treatment, and predictors of an unfavorable outcome of critically ill children  with SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHOD: This was a prospective observational study  performed in a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of a tertiary care COVID  referral hospital among critically ill children in the age group 1 month - 12  years admitted due to SARS-CoV-2 infection from June to December 2020.  Demographic, clinical profile, pSOFA and PRISM III scores, laboratory parameters,  treatment, and outcomes of the patients were recorded. Children who had a  prolonged PICU stay (>14 days) or died were compared with those who were  discharged from PICU within 14 days to assess predictors of unfavorable outcomes.  RESULTS: PICU admission rate among hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 infected children was  22.1% (92/416). Infants comprised the majority of the ICU population. Invasive  mechanical ventilation and inotropic support were required for 28.3% and 37% of  patients, respectively. Remdesivir, IVIg, and steroids were administered to  15.2%, 26.1%, and 54.3% of the subjects, respectively. The mortality rate was 7.6  %. MIS-C patients were older, less comorbid, and required less ventilator support  but more inotrope support than acute severe COVID-19 patients. Predictors of  unfavorable outcomes were age < 1 year, fever duration > 5 days, respiratory  distress, shock, comorbidity, elevated CRP (> 50 mg/L), procalcitonin (> 6 ng/L),  D-dimer (> 6 µg/L) and arterial lactate (> 2 mmol/L). CONCLUSION: Critically ill  children with unfavorable outcomes were predominantly infants, comorbid,  prolonged fever, respiratory distress, shock and elevated inflammatory markers,  D-dimer and lactate. These factors may be useful for watchful monitoring and  early intervention.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Studies in the literature regarding the use of remdesivir to treat COVID-19 patients have shown conflicting results. This study sought to answer  questions related to the use of remdesivir for the treatment of patients  hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID-19. METHODS: This was a systematic  review and meta-analysis including phase 3 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and  observational cohort studies selected from various databases, comparing patients  hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID-19 receiving remdesivir and controls.  RESULTS: A total of 207 studies were retrieved, 9 of which met the eligibility  criteria and were included in the study. The meta-analysis using RCTs alone  showed no statistically significant differences regarding mortality or use of  mechanical ventilation/extracorporeal membrane oxygenation between remdesivir and  control groups, and the quality of evidence was moderate and low, respectively.  The use of remdesivir increased the recovery rate by 6% (95% CI, 3-9); p = 0.004)  and the clinical improvement rate by 7% (95% CI, 1-14); p = 0.02). Additionally,  no significant differences in mortality were found between remdesivir and control  groups when the meta-analysis used observational cohort studies alone (risk  difference = -0.01 (95% CI, -0.02 to 0.01; p = 0.32), the quality of evidence  being moderate, and the risk of adverse events was 4% ([95% CI, -0.08 to 0.01]; p  = 0.09). CONCLUSIONS: The use of remdesivir for the treatment of patients with  moderate to severe COVID-19 had no significant impact on clinically important  outcomes.

AB  - Remdesivir has been shown to shorten the time to recovery in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Data on its use in pregnancy  are limited. In this single-center retrospective cohort study, our objective was  to determine whether early remdesivir use in pregnant individuals is associated  with decreased risk of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Forty-one  pregnant patients were included in this study, and outcomes were compared between  those who received remdesivir less than 7 days (early group) and 7 or more days  (late group) from onset of patient-reported symptoms. Early remdesivir  administration was associated with improved clinical outcomes, including lower  rates of ICU admission, decreased length of hospitalization, and decreased  progression to critical disease in pregnant individuals hospitalized with  COVID-19.

AB  - Type I interferons (IFN-I) exert pleiotropic biological effects during viral infections, balancing virus control versus immune-mediated pathologies, and have  been successfully employed for the treatment of viral diseases. Humans express 12  IFN-alpha (α) subtypes, which activate downstream signaling cascades and result  in distinct patterns of immune responses and differential antiviral responses.  Inborn errors in IFN-I immunity and the presence of anti-IFN autoantibodies  account for very severe courses of COVID-19; therefore, early administration of  IFN-I may be protective against life-threatening disease. Here we comprehensively  analyzed the antiviral activity of all IFNα subtypes against severe acute  respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to identify the underlying immune  signatures and explore their therapeutic potential. Prophylaxis of primary human  airway epithelial cells (hAEC) with different IFNα subtypes during SARS-CoV-2  infection uncovered distinct functional classes with high, intermediate, and low  antiviral IFNs. In particular, IFNα5 showed superior antiviral activity against  SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro and in SARS-CoV-2-infected mice in vivo. Dose  dependency studies further displayed additive effects upon coadministration with  the broad antiviral drug remdesivir in cell culture. Transcriptomic analysis of  IFN-treated hAEC revealed different transcriptional signatures, uncovering  distinct, intersecting, and prototypical genes of individual IFNα subtypes.  Global proteomic analyses systematically assessed the abundance of specific  antiviral key effector molecules which are involved in IFN-I signaling pathways,  negative regulation of viral processes, and immune effector processes for the  potent antiviral IFNα5. Taken together, our data provide a systemic, multimodular  definition of antiviral host responses mediated by defined IFN-I. This knowledge  will support the development of novel therapeutic approaches against SARS-CoV-2.

TI  - Remdesivir and three other drugs for hospitalised patients with COVID-19: final results of the WHO Solidarity randomised trial and updated meta-analyses.
T2  - Lancet (London, England)
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Solidarity trial among COVID-19 inpatients has previously reported interim mortality analyses for four repurposed antiviral drugs.  Lopinavir, hydroxychloroquine, and interferon (IFN)-β1a were discontinued for  futility but randomisation to remdesivir continued. Here, we report the final  results of Solidarity and meta-analyses of mortality in all relevant trials to  date. METHODS: Solidarity enrolled consenting adults (aged ≥18 years) recently  hospitalised with, in the view of their doctor, definite COVID-19 and no  contraindication to any of the study drugs, regardless of any other patient  characteristics. Participants were randomly allocated, in equal proportions  between the locally available options, to receive whichever of the four study  drugs (lopinavir, hydroxychloroquine, IFN-β1a, or remdesivir) were locally  available at that time or no study drug (controls). All patients also received  the local standard of care. No placebos were given. The protocol-specified  primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality, subdivided by disease severity.  Secondary endpoints were progression to ventilation if not already ventilated,  and time-to-discharge from hospital. Final log-rank and Kaplan-Meier analyses are  presented for remdesivir, and are appended for all four study drugs.  Meta-analyses give weighted averages of the mortality findings in this and all  other randomised trials of these drugs among hospital inpatients. Solidarity is  registered with ISRCTN, ISRCTN83971151, and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04315948.  FINDINGS: Between March 22, 2020, and Jan 29, 2021, 14 304 potentially eligible  patients were recruited from 454 hospitals in 35 countries in all six WHO  regions. After the exclusion of 83 (0·6%) patients with a refuted COVID-19  diagnosis or encrypted consent not entered into the database, Solidarity enrolled  14 221 patients, including 8275 randomly allocated (1:1) either to remdesivir  (ten daily infusions, unless discharged earlier) or to its control (allocated no  study drug although remdesivir was locally available). Compliance was high in  both groups. Overall, 602 (14·5%) of 4146 patients assigned to remdesivir died  versus 643 (15·6%) of 4129 assigned to control (mortality rate ratio [RR] 0·91  [95% CI 0·82-1·02], p=0·12). Of those already ventilated, 151 (42·1%) of 359  assigned to remdesivir died versus 134 (38·6%) of 347 assigned to control (RR  1·13 [0·89-1·42], p=0·32). Of those not ventilated but on oxygen, 14·6% assigned  to remdesivir died versus 16·3% assigned to control (RR 0·87 [0·76-0·99],  p=0·03). Of 1730 not on oxygen initially, 2·9% assigned to remdesivir died versus  3·8% assigned to control (RR 0·76 [0·46-1·28], p=0·30). Combining all those not  ventilated initially, 11·9% assigned to remdesivir died versus 13·5% assigned to  control (RR 0·86 [0·76-0·98], p=0·02) and 14·1% versus 15·7% progressed to  ventilation (RR 0·88 [0·77-1·00], p=0·04). The non-prespecified composite outcome  of death or progression to ventilation occurred in 19·6% assigned to remdesivir  versus 22·5% assigned to control (RR 0·84 [0·75-0·93], p=0·001). Allocation to  daily remdesivir infusions (vs open-label control) delayed discharge by about 1  day during the 10-day treatment period. A meta-analysis of mortality in all  randomised trials of remdesivir versus no remdesivir yielded similar findings.  INTERPRETATION: Remdesivir has no significant effect on patients with COVID-19  who are already being ventilated. Among other hospitalised patients, it has a  small effect against death or progression to ventilation (or both). FUNDING: WHO.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) represents an unmet clinical need, due to a high mortality rate, rapid mutation rate in the virus, increased chances of  reinfection, lack of effectiveness of repurposed drugs and economic damage.  COVID-19 pandemic has created an urgent need for effective molecules. Clinically  proven efficacy and safety profiles have made favipiravir (FVP) and remdesivir  (RDV) promising therapeutic options for use against severe acute respiratory  syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Even though both are prodrug  molecules with an antiviral role based on a similar mechanism of action,  differences in pharmacological, pharmacokinetic and pharmacotoxicological  mechanisms have been identified. The present study aims to provide a  comprehensive comparative assessment of FVP and RDV against SARS-CoV-2  infections, by centralizing medical data provided by significant literature and  authorized clinical trials, focusing on the importance of a better understanding  of the interactions between drug molecules and infectious agents in order to  improve the global management of COVID-19 patients and to reduce the risk of  antiviral resistance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Remdesivir improves clinical outcomes in patients hospitalized with moderate-to-severe coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). Whether the use of  remdesivir in symptomatic, nonhospitalized patients with Covid-19 who are at high  risk for disease progression prevents hospitalization is uncertain. METHODS: We  conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving  nonhospitalized patients with Covid-19 who had symptom onset within the previous  7 days and who had at least one risk factor for disease progression (age ≥60  years, obesity, or certain coexisting medical conditions). Patients were randomly  assigned to receive intravenous remdesivir (200 mg on day 1 and 100 mg on days 2  and 3) or placebo. The primary efficacy end point was a composite of  Covid-19-related hospitalization or death from any cause by day 28. The primary  safety end point was any adverse event. A secondary end point was a composite of  a Covid-19-related medically attended visit or death from any cause by day 28.  RESULTS: A total of 562 patients who underwent randomization and received at  least one dose of remdesivir or placebo were included in the analyses: 279  patients in the remdesivir group and 283 in the placebo group. The mean age was  50 years, 47.9% of the patients were women, and 41.8% were Hispanic or Latinx.  The most common coexisting conditions were diabetes mellitus (61.6%), obesity  (55.2%), and hypertension (47.7%). Covid-19-related hospitalization or death from  any cause occurred in 2 patients (0.7%) in the remdesivir group and in 15 (5.3%)  in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.03 to  0.59; P = 0.008). A total of 4 of 246 patients (1.6%) in the remdesivir group and  21 of 252 (8.3%) in the placebo group had a Covid-19-related medically attended  visit by day 28 (hazard ratio, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.56). No patients had died  by day 28. Adverse events occurred in 42.3% of the patients in the remdesivir  group and in 46.3% of those in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: Among  nonhospitalized patients who were at high risk for Covid-19 progression, a 3-day  course of remdesivir had an acceptable safety profile and resulted in an 87%  lower risk of hospitalization or death than placebo.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 virus has infected more than 261 million people and has led to more than 5 million deaths in the past year and a half(1) ( https://www.who.org/  ). Individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection typically develop mild-to-severe  flu-like symptoms, whereas infection of a subset of individuals leads to  severe-to-fatal clinical outcomes(2). Although vaccines have been rapidly  developed to combat SARS-CoV-2, there has been a dearth of antiviral  therapeutics. There is an urgent need for therapeutics, which has been amplified  by the emerging threats of variants that may evade vaccines. Large-scale efforts  are underway to identify antiviral drugs. Here we screened approximately 18,000  drugs for antiviral activity using live virus infection in human respiratory  cells and validated 122 drugs with antiviral activity and selectivity against  SARS-CoV-2. Among these candidates are 16 nucleoside analogues, the largest  category of clinically used antivirals. This included the antivirals remdesivir  and molnupiravir, which have been approved for use in COVID-19. RNA viruses rely  on a high supply of nucleoside triphosphates from the host to efficiently  replicate, and we identified a panel of host nucleoside biosynthesis inhibitors  as antiviral. Moreover, we found that combining pyrimidine biosynthesis  inhibitors with antiviral nucleoside analogues synergistically inhibits  SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro and in vivo against emerging strains of SARS-CoV-2,  suggesting a clinical path forward.

AB  - BACKGROUND: New treatment modalities are urgently needed for patients with COVID-19. The World Health Organization (WHO) Solidarity trial showed no effect  of remdesivir or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) on mortality, but the antiviral effects  of these drugs are not known. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of remdesivir  and HCQ on all-cause, in-hospital mortality; the degree of respiratory failure  and inflammation; and viral clearance in the oropharynx. DESIGN: NOR-Solidarity  is an independent, add-on, randomized controlled trial to the WHO Solidarity  trial that included biobanking and 3 months of clinical follow-up  (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04321616). SETTING: 23 hospitals in Norway. PATIENTS:  Eligible patients were adults hospitalized with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.  INTERVENTION: Between 28 March and 4 October 2020, a total of 185 patients were  randomly assigned and 181 were included in the full analysis set. Patients  received remdesivir (n = 42), HCQ (n = 52), or standard of care (SoC) (n = 87).  MEASUREMENTS: In addition to the primary end point of WHO Solidarity,  study-specific outcomes were viral clearance in oropharyngeal specimens, the  degree of respiratory failure, and inflammatory variables. RESULTS: No  significant differences were seen between treatment groups in mortality during  hospitalization. There was a marked decrease in SARS-CoV-2 load in the oropharynx  during the first week overall, with similar decreases and 10-day viral loads  among the remdesivir, HCQ, and SoC groups. Remdesivir and HCQ did not affect the  degree of respiratory failure or inflammatory variables in plasma or serum. The  lack of antiviral effect was not associated with symptom duration, level of viral  load, degree of inflammation, or presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 at  hospital admittance. LIMITATION: The trial had no placebo group. CONCLUSION:  Neither remdesivir nor HCQ affected viral clearance in hospitalized patients with  COVID-19.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the third human coronavirus within 20 years that gave rise to a life-threatening disease  and the first to reach pandemic spread. To make therapeutic headway against  current and future coronaviruses, the biology of coronavirus RNA during infection  must be precisely understood. Here, we present a robust and generalizable  framework combining high-throughput confocal and super-resolution microscopy  imaging to study coronavirus infection at the nanoscale. Using the model human  coronavirus HCoV-229E, we specifically labeled coronavirus genomic RNA (gRNA) and  double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) via multi-color RNA immunoFISH and visualized their  localization patterns within the cell. The 10-nm resolution achieved by our  approach uncovers a striking spatial organization of gRNA and dsRNA into three  distinct structures and enables quantitative characterization of the status of  the infection after antiviral drug treatment. Our approach provides a  comprehensive imaging framework that will enable future investigations of  coronavirus fundamental biology and therapeutic effects.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: When the world was frantically searching for a drug effective against the coronavirus disease (COVID)-19, remdesivir, a  broad-spectrum anti-viral medication, became a part of the COVID treatment. We  planned a study to evaluate improvement in clinical outcomes with remdesivir  treatment for five days. METHODS: Participants more than 40-years old and with  moderate to severe COVID-19 but not on mechanical ventilation were randomly  assigned into two groups-remdesivir group (34 cases) to receive the study drug  intravenous (IV) remdesivir for five days plus the standard care (SC) and  non-remdesivir group (36 cases) to receive the SC but not to receive the study  drug. Follow-up was continued for 12 days after the beginning of treatment or  until discharge/death. Patient's clinical status was assessed by laboratory  investigations and physical examination (from day 1 to day 12 on a 4-point  ordinal scale and from day 12 to 24 on a 6-point ordinal scale). Oxygen support  requirements and adverse events were recorded. The data were entered and analysed  using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22.0. RESULTS:  High-flow oxygen support and non-invasive ventilation was required at baseline by  lesser patients in the remdesivir group. In the end, both groups had similar  outcomes after adjustment for baseline clinical status. There was no statistical  difference in mortality between the two groups (p = 0.749). Patients in both  groups had an equal time to recovery. There was no difference in the occurrence  of adverse effects of remdesivir between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Remdesivir  therapy for five days did not produce improvement in clinical outcomes in  moderate to severe COVID-19 cases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is causing a grave global health and economic crisis and the fight against the pandemic has led to unprecedented scientific activity.  Bibliometrics could be a useful tool for guiding future researches lines and  promoting international collaboration for an effective treatment. For this  purpose, we have conducted a bibliometric analysis of scientific publications on  drugs and therapies used to treat COVID-19 during 2020. METHODS: Data source: Web  of Science. We gathered data on scientific production relating to drugs used to  treat COVID-19. We calculated impact factors and analyzed production by  institution, country, and journal, visualizing our results in bibliometric  networks. RESULTS: In 1 year, production relating to COVID-19 exceeded 100 000  publications, with over 6,500 on Drugs and COVID-19. Research into  hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, remdesivir, lopinavir and ritonavir,  tocilizumab and convalescent plasma is particularly noteworthy. Mean  citations/study range from 11.9 to 15.4. Producer institutions fall into three  groups: one in the US and centered on Harvard Medical School; another in Europe  led by INSERS; and another in China led by Huazhong University of Science and  Technology. Production by journal is widespread but the Journal of Medical  Virology, International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents, and American Journal of  Transplantation are noteworthy. CONCLUSIONS: The volume of research that is  currently under way is comparable to the magnitude of the pandemic itself. Such a  high volume of studies is infrequent and the impact they have achieved has no  known precedent. The producing countries are those with highest incidence of the  pandemic and greatest scientific potential; moreover, inter-agency and  international collaboration has reached extraordinarily high levels.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Remdesivir demonstrated clinical benefit in a placebo-controlled trial in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but its effect  in patients with moderate disease is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine the  efficacy of 5 or 10 days of remdesivir treatment compared with standard care on  clinical status on day 11 after initiation of treatment. DESIGN, SETTING, AND  PARTICIPANTS: Randomized, open-label trial of hospitalized patients with  confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection  and moderate COVID-19 pneumonia (pulmonary infiltrates and room-air oxygen  saturation >94%) enrolled from March 15 through April 18, 2020, at 105 hospitals  in the United States, Europe, and Asia. The date of final follow-up was May 20,  2020. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a  10-day course of remdesivir (n = 197), a 5-day course of remdesivir (n = 199), or  standard care (n = 200). Remdesivir was dosed intravenously at 200 mg on day 1  followed by 100 mg/d. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was  clinical status on day 11 on a 7-point ordinal scale ranging from death (category  1) to discharged (category 7). Differences between remdesivir treatment groups  and standard care were calculated using proportional odds models and expressed as  odds ratios. An odds ratio greater than 1 indicates difference in clinical status  distribution toward category 7 for the remdesivir group vs the standard care  group. RESULTS: Among 596 patients who were randomized, 584 began the study and  received remdesivir or continued standard care (median age, 57 [interquartile  range, 46-66] years; 227 [39%] women; 56% had cardiovascular disease, 42%  hypertension, and 40% diabetes), and 533 (91%) completed the trial. Median length  of treatment was 5 days for patients in the 5-day remdesivir group and 6 days for  patients in the 10-day remdesivir group. On day 11, patients in the 5-day  remdesivir group had statistically significantly higher odds of a better clinical  status distribution than those receiving standard care (odds ratio, 1.65; 95% CI,  1.09-2.48; P = .02). The clinical status distribution on day 11 between the  10-day remdesivir and standard care groups was not significantly different  (P = .18 by Wilcoxon rank sum test). By day 28, 9 patients had died: 2 (1%) in  the 5-day remdesivir group, 3 (2%) in the 10-day remdesivir group, and 4 (2%) in  the standard care group. Nausea (10% vs 3%), hypokalemia (6% vs 2%), and headache  (5% vs 3%) were more frequent among remdesivir-treated patients compared with  standard care. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with moderate COVID-19,  those randomized to a 10-day course of remdesivir did not have a statistically  significant difference in clinical status compared with standard care at 11 days  after initiation of treatment. Patients randomized to a 5-day course of  remdesivir had a statistically significant difference in clinical status compared  with standard care, but the difference was of uncertain clinical importance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 causes a wide range of symptoms, with particularly high risk of severe respiratory failure and death in patients with predisposing risk  factors such as advanced age or obesity. Recipients of solid organ transplants,  and in particular lung transplantation, are more susceptible to viral infection  owing to immune suppressive medication. As little is known about the SARS-CoV-2  infection in these patients, this study was undertaken to describe outcomes and  potential management strategies in early COVID-19 infection early after lung  transplantation. METHODS: We describe the incidence and outcome of COVID-19 in a  cohort of recent lung transplant recipients in Munich. Six of 186 patients who  underwent lung transplantation in the period between March 2019 and March 2021  developed COVID-19 within the first year after transplantation. We documented the  clinical course and laboratory changes for all patients showing differences in  the severity of the infection with COVID-19 and their outcomes. RESULTS: Three of  6 SARS-CoV-2 infections were hospital-acquired and the patients were still in  inpatient treatment after lung transplantation. All patients suffered from  symptoms. One patient did not receive antiviral therapy. Remdesivir was  prescribed in 4 patients and the remaining patient received remdesivir,  bamlanivimab and convalescent plasma. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 does not appear to  cause milder disease in lung transplant recipients compared with the general  population. Immunosuppression is potentially responsible for the delayed  formation of antibodies and their premature loss. Several comorbidities and a  general poor preoperative condition showed an extended hospital stay.

AB  - BACKGROUND: No specific antiviral drug has been proven effective for treatment of patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Remdesivir (GS-5734), a  nucleoside analogue prodrug, has inhibitory effects on pathogenic animal and  human coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  (SARS-CoV-2) in vitro, and inhibits Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus,  SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2 replication in animal models. METHODS: We did a  randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial at ten hospitals  in Hubei, China. Eligible patients were adults (aged ≥18 years) admitted to  hospital with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, with an interval from  symptom onset to enrolment of 12 days or less, oxygen saturation of 94% or less  on room air or a ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired  oxygen of 300 mm Hg or less, and radiologically confirmed pneumonia. Patients  were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to intravenous remdesivir (200 mg on day 1  followed by 100 mg on days 2-10 in single daily infusions) or the same volume of  placebo infusions for 10 days. Patients were permitted concomitant use of  lopinavir-ritonavir, interferons, and corticosteroids. The primary endpoint was  time to clinical improvement up to day 28, defined as the time (in days) from  randomisation to the point of a decline of two levels on a six-point ordinal  scale of clinical status (from 1=discharged to 6=death) or discharged alive from  hospital, whichever came first. Primary analysis was done in the  intention-to-treat (ITT) population and safety analysis was done in all patients  who started their assigned treatment. This trial is registered with  ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04257656. FINDINGS: Between Feb 6, 2020, and March 12,  2020, 237 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to a treatment group (158  to remdesivir and 79 to placebo); one patient in the placebo group who withdrew  after randomisation was not included in the ITT population. Remdesivir use was  not associated with a difference in time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio  1·23 [95% CI 0·87-1·75]). Although not statistically significant, patients  receiving remdesivir had a numerically faster time to clinical improvement than  those receiving placebo among patients with symptom duration of 10 days or less  (hazard ratio 1·52 [0·95-2·43]). Adverse events were reported in 102 (66%) of 155  remdesivir recipients versus 50 (64%) of 78 placebo recipients. Remdesivir was  stopped early because of adverse events in 18 (12%) patients versus four (5%)  patients who stopped placebo early. INTERPRETATION: In this study of adult  patients admitted to hospital for severe COVID-19, remdesivir was not associated  with statistically significant clinical benefits. However, the numerical  reduction in time to clinical improvement in those treated earlier requires  confirmation in larger studies.

AB  - PURPOSE: Preliminary data suggest that remdesivir may influence the course of COVID-19 according to the duration of pre-admission symptoms. We aim to evaluate  whether early use of remdesivir is associated with a reduced COVID-19 progression  in a homogeneous cohort of patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. METHODS: This  prospective, observational study included patients with COVID-19 pneumonia  treated with remdesivir at the University Hospital of Pisa (Italy) from September  2020 to January 2021. According to national recommendations, remdesivir was  prescribed in patients with pneumonia who required oxygen supplementation by  nasal cannula or mask but without the need for high-flow nasal cannula,  non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation and had symptoms from no more  than 10 days. Patients who received early (≤5 days from onset of symptoms) versus  late (>5 days from onset of symptoms) remdesivir were compared. The primary  outcome was a composite of high-flow nasal cannula, non-invasive or invasive  mechanical ventilation, or death. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was  performed to identify factors independently associated with the composite  endpoint. FINDINGS: Among 312 consecutive patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who  received remdesivir, 90 (28.8%) received early remdesivir, whereas 222 (71.2%)  received late remdesivir. Twenty-nine patients (32.2%) in the early-remdesivir  group versus 104 patients (46.8%) in the late-remdesivir group met the primary  end point (P = 0.018). On multivariate analysis, a history of dyspnea at home  (odds ratio = 2.53; 95% CI, 1.55-4.12; P < 0.001) was the strongest factor  independently associated with the progression to severe COVID-19, whereas  early-remdesivir use was a protective factor (odds ratio = 0.49; 95% CI,  0.27-0.87; P = 0.015). The delayed admission to the hospital was associated with  a delayed administration of remdesivir. IMPLICATIONS: The early use of remdesivir  (<5 days from symptoms onset) may reduce COVID-19 progression. The identification  of patients who need early hospitalization and early remdesivir may provide  clinical benefit in patients with COVID-19.

AB  - COVID-19 significantly impairs survival rates among hematological patients when compared to the general population. Our prospective multicentre project analyzed  early administration of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein neutralizing monoclonal  antibodies (NmAbs) - bamlanivimab (72%) and casirivimab/imdevimab (28%) -  efficacy among hematological patients with early-stage COVID-19. Mortality rate  was compared to a control cohort of 575 SARS-CoV-2 positive hematological  patients untreated with any specific anti-COVID-19 therapy. 88 hematological  patients with lymphomas, acute leukemias, and myeloma as their most frequent  underlying diagnoses (72%) were evaluated with a 97 days median follow-up after  NmAb administration. One third of patients (32%) were treated with an anti-CD20  monoclonal antibody before COVID-19 diagnosis. Median time between first COVID-19  symptom and NmAb administration was 2 days. When administering NmAb, 29%, 57%,  11%, 2%, and 1% of our patients had asymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe, and  critical degrees of COVID-19, respectively. 80% of baseline asymptomatic patients  remained asymptomatic following NmAb administration. Median duration of COVID-19  symptoms after NmAb administration was 2.5 days. Progression to severe/critical  COVID-19 occurred among a total of 17% (15/88) of our cases and numerically  higher with bamlanivimab versus casirivimab/imdevimab (21% vs. 8%; p = 0.215),  and myelomas (29%), lymphomas (17%) and acute leukemias (18%), respectively.  During final follow-up, nine deaths (10%) were recorded - all after bamlanivimab  (p = 0.056) with 8% attributed to COVID-19. Regarding "remdesivir/convalescent  plasma naïve" patients, COVID-19 mortality rates were significantly lower in our  NmAbs treated cohort compared to the control cohort of untreated SARS-CoV-2  positive hematological patients (6% vs. 16%, p = 0.020), respectively. Our study  validated the safety and efficacy of NmAbs early use among hematological patients  with newly diagnosed early-stage COVID-19 in terms of alleviating infection  course and decreasing mortality. Results confirmed a more positive effect of a  casirivimab/imdevimab combination versus bamlanivimab monotherapy.

AB  - The recent outbreak of COVID-19 infection started in Wuhan, China, and spread across China and beyond. Since the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic (March 11,  2020), three vaccines and only one antiviral drug (remdesivir) have been approved  (Oct 22, 2020) by the FDA. The coronavirus enters human epithelial cells by the  binding of the densely glycosylated fusion spike protein (S protein) to a  receptor (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, ACE2) on the host cell surface.  Therefore, inhibiting the viral entry is a promising treatment pathway for  preventing or ameliorating the effects of COVID-19 infection. In the current  work, we have used all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate  the influence of the MLN-4760 inhibitor on the conformational properties of ACE2  and its interaction with the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. We have  found that the presence of an inhibitor tends to completely/partially open the  ACE2 receptor where the two subdomains (I and II) move away from each other,  while the absence results in partial or complete closure. The current study  increases our understanding of ACE inhibition by MLN-4760 and how it modulates  the conformational properties of ACE2.

AB  - AIMS: This retrospective analysis of the Optum Clinformatics Data Mart database evaluated US patient characteristics, healthcare resource utilization (HCRU),  costs, and treatment patterns among unvaccinated adults with outpatient-diagnosed  COVID-19 to quantify US economic burden. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The index event  was the earliest outpatient diagnosis of confirmed COVID-19 from May 1 to  December 10, 2020. Patients had 12 months' continuous enrollment before and were  followed for ≥60 days after index date until insurance dis-enrollment or study  end. RESULTS: 236,589 patients had outpatient-diagnosed COVID-19 (7,692 with and  228,897 without subsequent COVID-19-related inpatient admission >48 h  post-diagnosis). The median age was 51 years (≥65 years, 30.0%); 72.4% had ≥1  risk factor. Patients with versus without subsequent inpatient admission were  more often male, older, Black/Hispanic, and had comorbidities/risk factors. With  a median follow-up of 162 days, patients had a median of 1 COVID-19-related  outpatient visit (with inpatient admission, 5 outpatient visits). Those with  inpatient admission had a median of 1 COVID-19-related inpatient visit (median  length of stay [LOS], 6 days), 33.3% were admitted to intensive care (median LOS,  8 days), 8.4%, 7.1%, and 13.3% received invasive mechanical ventilation,  noninvasive mechanical ventilation, and supplemental oxygen, respectively; 13.5%  experienced readmission. Inpatient mortality was 6.0% (0.3% for nonhospitalized  patients). Antithrombotic therapy, antibiotics, corticosteroids, and remdesivir  use increased among patients with inpatient admission versus without. Median  total COVID-19-related non-zero medical costs were $208 for patients without  inpatient admission (with inpatient admission, $39,187). LIMITATIONS: Results  reflect the circulating SARS-CoV-2 and treatment landscape during the study  period. Requirements for continuous enrollment could have biased the population.  Cost measurements may have included allowed (typically higher) and charge  amounts. CONCLUSIONS: Given the numbers of the US population who are still not  fully vaccinated and the evolving epidemiology of the pandemic, this study  provides relevant insights on real-world treatment patterns, HCRU, and the cost  burden of outpatient-diagnosed COVID-19.

AB  - Recently, a novel coronavirus, known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has raised global concerns, being the etiological  agent of the current pandemic infectious coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).  Specific prophylactic treatments like vaccines, have been authorized for use by  regulatory bodies in multiple countries, however there is an urgent need to  identify new, safe, and targeted therapeutics as post-exposure therapy for  COVID-19. Among a plethora of potential pharmacological targets, the  angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) membrane receptor, which plays a crucial  role in viral entry, is representing an attractive intervention opportunity for  SARS-CoV-2 antiviral discovery process. In this scenario, we envisioned that  binding to ACE2 by multivalent attachment of ligands to nanocarriers  incorporating antiviral therapeutics, it would increase receptor avidity and  impart specificity to these nanovectors for host cells, particularly in the  pulmonary tract, which is the primary entry route for SARS-CoV-2. Herein, we  report the design and development of novel polymeric nanoparticles (NP), densely  grafted with various ligands to selectively bind to ACE2, as innovative  nanovectors for targeted drug delivery. We first evaluated the impact of these  biocompatible targeted NP (TNP) on ligand binding toward ACE2 and measured their  competition ability vs a model of spike protein (Lipo-S1). Next, we tested the  effectiveness of the most performing nanoprotopype, TNP-1, loaded with a model  anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug such as remdesivir (RDV), on antiviral activity against  SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero E6 cells. The RDV-TNP-1 exhibited a significantly  improved antiviral effect compared to RDV at the same concentration.  Interestingly, unloaded TNP (TNP-1E) also exhibited a basal antiviral activity,  potentially due to a direct competitive mechanism with viral particles for the  ACE2 binding site. We also measured the anti-exopeptidase activity of TNP-1E  against ACE2 protein. Collectively, these insights warrant in-depth preclinical  development for our nanoprototypes, for example as potential inhalable drug  carriers, with the perspective of a clinical translation.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1 variant emerged in 2021(1) and has multiple mutations in its spike protein(2). Here we show that the spike protein of Omicron has a  higher affinity for ACE2 compared with Delta, and a marked change in its  antigenicity increases Omicron's evasion of therapeutic monoclonal and  vaccine-elicited polyclonal neutralizing antibodies after two doses. mRNA  vaccination as a third vaccine dose rescues and broadens neutralization.  Importantly, the antiviral drugs remdesivir and molnupiravir retain efficacy  against Omicron BA.1. Replication was similar for Omicron and Delta virus  isolates in human nasal epithelial cultures. However, in lung cells and gut  cells, Omicron demonstrated lower replication. Omicron spike protein was less  efficiently cleaved compared with Delta. The differences in replication were  mapped to the entry efficiency of the virus on the basis of  spike-pseudotyped virus assays. The defect in entry of Omicron pseudotyped virus  to specific cell types effectively correlated with higher cellular RNA expression  of TMPRSS2, and deletion of TMPRSS2 affected Delta entry to a greater extent than  Omicron. Furthermore, drug inhibitors targeting specific entry pathways(3)  demonstrated that the Omicron spike inefficiently uses the cellular protease  TMPRSS2, which promotes cell entry through plasma membrane fusion, with greater  dependency on cell entry through the endocytic pathway. Consistent with  suboptimal S1/S2 cleavage and inability to use TMPRSS2, syncytium formation by  the Omicron spike was substantially impaired compared with the Delta spike. The  less efficient spike cleavage of Omicron at S1/S2 is associated with a shift in  cellular tropism away from TMPRSS2-expressing cells, with implications for  altered pathogenesis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to pose a significant threat to public health worldwide. The purpose of this study was to review  current evidence obtained from randomized clinical trials on the efficacy of  antivirals for COVID-19 treatment. METHODS: A systematic literature search was  performed using PubMed to identify randomized controlled trials published up to  September 4, 2021 that examined the efficacy of antivirals for COVID-19  treatment. Studies that were not randomized controlled trials or that did not  include treatment of COVID-19 with approved antivirals were excluded. Risk of  bias was assessed using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN)  method. Due to study heterogeneity, inferential statistics were not performed and  data were expressed as descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Of the 2,284 articles  retrieved, 31 (12,440 patients) articles were included. Overall, antivirals were  more effective when administered early in the disease course. No antiviral  treatment demonstrated efficacy at reducing COVID-19 mortality.  Sofosbuvir/daclatasvir results suggested clinical improvement, although  statistical power was low. Remdesivir exhibited efficacy in reducing time to  recovery, but results were inconsistent across trials. CONCLUSIONS: Although  select antivirals have exhibited efficacy to improve clinical outcomes in  COVID-19 patients, none demonstrated efficacy in reducing mortality. Larger RCTs  are needed to conclusively establish efficacy.

AB  - A key element for the prevention and management of coronavirus disease 2019 is the development of effective therapeutics. Drug combination strategies offer  several advantages over monotherapies. They have the potential to achieve greater  efficacy, to increase the therapeutic index of drugs and to reduce the emergence  of drug resistance. We assessed the in vitro synergistic interaction between  remdesivir and ivermectin, both approved by the US Food and Drug Administration,  and demonstrated enhanced antiviral activity against severe acute respiratory  syndrome coronavirus-2. Whilst the in vitro synergistic activity reported here  does not support the clinical application of this combination treatment strategy  due to insufficient exposure of ivermectin in vivo, the data do warrant further  investigation. Efforts to define the mechanisms underpinning the observed  synergistic action could lead to the development of novel treatment strategies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Prevalence and clinical impact of increased liver function tests in patients affected by Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is controversial. AIMS:  This observational study evaluates the prevalence of transaminases elevation in  hospitalized patients affected by COVID-19 and investigates the presence of  factors associated with hepatocellular injury and with mortality. METHODS: Data  of 292 adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to the Ente Ospedaliero  Cantonale (Switzerland) were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Transaminases  were increased in about one-third of patients on hospital admission and  two-thirds of patients during the hospital stay. On hospital admission,  transaminases were more commonly elevated in younger patients, who also reported  elevated C reactive protein and a higher degree of respiratory failure.  Independent factors associated with abnormal transaminases during hospitalization  were drugs, in particular paracetamol (OR=2.67; 95% CI=1.38-5.18; p = 0.004) and  remdesivir (OR=5.16; 95% CI=1.10-24.26; p = 0.04). Mortality was independently  associated to age (OR = 1.09; 95% CI=1.05-1.13; p<0.001), admission to intensive  care unit (OR=5.22; 95% CI=2.28-11.90; p<0.001) and alkaline phosphatase peak  (OR=1.01; 95% CI=1.00- 1.01; p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: On hospital admission,  factors associated with liver damage were linked to demographic and clinical  characteristics (age, inflammation and hypoxia) while, during hospitalization,  drug treatment was related to development and progression of hepatocellular  damage. Mortality was associated with alkaline phosphate peak value.

TI  - Hyperimmune immunoglobulin for hospitalised patients with COVID-19 (ITAC): a double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3, randomised trial.
T2  - Lancet (London, England)
AB  - BACKGROUND: Passive immunotherapy using hyperimmune intravenous immunoglobulin (hIVIG) to SARS-CoV-2, derived from recovered donors, is a potential rapidly  available, specific therapy for an outbreak infection such as SARS-CoV-2.  Findings from randomised clinical trials of hIVIG for the treatment of COVID-19  are limited. METHODS: In this international randomised, double-blind,  placebo-controlled trial, hospitalised patients with COVID-19 who had been  symptomatic for up to 12 days and did not have acute end-organ failure were  randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either hIVIG or an equivalent volume of saline  as placebo, in addition to remdesivir, when not contraindicated, and other  standard clinical care. Randomisation was stratified by site pharmacy; schedules  were prepared using a mass-weighted urn design. Infusions were prepared and  masked by trial pharmacists; all other investigators, research staff, and trial  participants were masked to group allocation. Follow-up was for 28 days. The  primary outcome was measured at day 7 by a seven-category ordinal endpoint that  considered pulmonary status and extrapulmonary complications and ranged from no  limiting symptoms to death. Deaths and adverse events, including organ failure  and serious infections, were used to define composite safety outcomes at days 7  and 28. Prespecified subgroup analyses were carried out for efficacy and safety  outcomes by duration of symptoms, the presence of anti-spike neutralising  antibodies, and other baseline factors. Analyses were done on a modified  intention-to-treat (mITT) population, which included all randomly assigned  participants who met eligibility criteria and received all or part of the  assigned study product infusion. This study is registered with  ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04546581. FINDINGS: From Oct 8, 2020, to Feb 10, 2021, 593  participants (n=301 hIVIG, n=292 placebo) were enrolled at 63 sites in 11  countries; 579 patients were included in the mITT analysis. Compared with  placebo, the hIVIG group did not have significantly greater odds of a more  favourable outcome at day 7; the adjusted OR was 1·06 (95% CI 0·77-1·45; p=0·72).  Infusions were well tolerated, although infusion reactions were more common in  the hIVIG group (18·6% vs 9·5% for placebo; p=0·002). The percentage with the  composite safety outcome at day 7 was similar for the hIVIG (24%) and placebo  groups (25%; OR 0·98, 95% CI 0·66-1·46; p=0·91). The ORs for the day 7 ordinal  outcome did not vary for subgroups considered, but there was evidence of  heterogeneity of the treatment effect for the day 7 composite safety outcome:  risk was greater for hIVIG compared with placebo for patients who were antibody  positive (OR 2·21, 95% CI 1·14-4·29); for patients who were antibody negative,  the OR was 0·51 (0·29-0·90; p(interaction)=0·001). INTERPRETATION: When  administered with standard of care including remdesivir, SARS-CoV-2 hIVIG did not  demonstrate efficacy among patients hospitalised with COVID-19 without end-organ  failure. The safety of hIVIG might vary by the presence of endogenous  neutralising antibodies at entry. FUNDING: US National Institutes of Health.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We reported a case of multiple sclerosis (MS) with persistent symptomatic COVID-19, which was complicated by new-appearing severe pneumonia 40  days after disease onset. CASE PRESENTATION: A 38-year-old man with a history of  multiple sclerosis referred to our hospital with fever, shaking chills, cough,  and dyspnea. In his history, the patient had developed mild COVID-19 from 40 days  ago. After 7 days of disease onset, the COVID symptoms had been subsided  partially, but fatigue, myalgia, intermittent fever, and loss of taste and smell  had been continued. In physical examinations, his oral temperature was 39.4 °C.  He had respiratory distress, and his blood oxygen saturation on the room air was  90%. The spiral chest CT scan was performed, which revealed bilateral  ground-glass and alveolar opacities in favor of COVID-19 pneumonia. The result of  the RT-PCR test for SARS-COV-2 was reported positive subsequently. His current MS  medication was rituximab and he had received the last dose of rituximab two  months before developing COVID-19. The patient was admitted to the COVID ward and  put on Remdesivir, subcutaneous interferon-beta1b, and dexamethasone. He improved  gradually and was discharged from the hospital with the favorable condition after  10 days. This patient had a rare protracted disease course. We presumed that  prolonged high degree fever (above 38 °C) in our patient is beyond the diagnosis  of the post-COVID-19 syndrome and is more compatible with persistent infection.  CONCLUSION: Although most immunocompromised patients effectively clear SARS-CoV-2  infection, this case report highlights the risk of persistent infection  associated with recurrence of the disease.

T2  - European journal of clinical pharmacology
AB  - PURPOSE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus has affected millions all  over the world and has been declared pandemic, as of 11 March 2020. In addition  to the ongoing research and development of vaccines, there is still a dire need  for safe and effective drugs for the control and treatment against the SARS-CoV-2  virus infection. Numerous repurposed drugs are under clinical investigations  whose reported adverse events can raise worries about their safety. The aim of  this review is to illuminate the associated adverse events related to the drugs  used in a real COVID-19 setting along with their relevant mechanism(s). METHOD:  Through a literature search conducted on PubMed and Google Scholar database,  various adverse events suspected to be induced by eight drugs, including  dexamethasone, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, remdesivir, favipiravir,  lopinavir/ritonavir, ivermectin, and tocilizumab, administered in COVID-19  patients in clinical practice and studies were identified in 30 case reports, 3  case series, and 10 randomized clinical trials. RESULTS: Mild, moderate, or  severe adverse events of numerous repurposed and investigational drugs caused by  various factors and mechanisms were observed. Gastrointestinal side effects such  as nausea, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, and vomiting were the most frequently  followed by cardiovascular, cutaneous, and hepatic adverse events. Few other rare  adverse drug reactions were also observed. CONCLUSION: In light of their  ineffectiveness against COVID-19 as evident in large clinical studies, drugs  including hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ivermectin should neither  be used routinely nor in clinical studies. While lack of sufficient data, it  creates doubt regarding the reliability of chloroquine and favipiravir use in  COVID-19 patients. Hence, these two drugs can only be used in clinical studies.  In contrast, ample well-conducted studies have approved the use of remdesivir,  tocilizumab, and dexamethasone under certain conditions in COVID-19 patients.  Consequently, it is significant to establish a strong surveillance system in  order to monitor the proper safety and toxicity profile of the potential  anti-COVID-19 drugs with good clinical outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with haematological malignancies have an increased susceptibility for COVID-19 and higher mortality. They may also have prolonged  symptoms and viral shedding. Clinical trials have not specifically addressed the  management of this patient group. We present a lymphoma patient with COVID-19 who  was treated with remdesivir, and a literature review of similar cases. METHODS:  SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, virus culture and whole-genome sequencing were performed from  nasopharyngeal swabs and antibody testing from serum. In addition, SARS-CoV-2  nucleocapsid antigen was tested from serum. Medline was searched for reported  cases of lymphoma and COVID-19 treated with remdesivir. RESULTS: The patient was  undergoing lymphoma treatment including chemotherapy, rituximab and prednisolone.  After diagnosis of COVID-19, broad-spectrum antibiotics were administered due to  neutropenia and fever. After 20 d of fever with no signs of co-infection,  remdesivir was initiated with rapid response. The treatment was continued for  4 d. Serum SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests were negative 20, 30 and 66 d from symptom  onset. Before starting remdesivir, the SARS-CoV-2 PCR and virus culture from the  nasopharynx and serum antigen test were positive. From earlier reports, we  identified a total of eleven cases of lymphoma and COVID-19 treated with  remdesivir accompanied by other antivirals and anti-inflammatory agents.  CONCLUSIONS: As shown in this and earlier reports on lymphoma patients, the  clinical course of COVID-19 may be protracted and a humoral immune response may  remain absent. In addition, optimal management remains undecided. The presented  patient responded well to a short course of remdesivir.

VeroE6-GFP cells were pre-treated  overnight with serial dilutions of the compounds before infection. The GFP signal  was determined by high-content imaging on day 4 post-infection. All molecules  have equipotent antiviral activity against the ancestral virus and the VOCs  Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron. These findings are in line with the  observation that the target proteins of these antivirals (respectively the viral  RNA dependent RNA polymerase and the viral main protease Mpro) are highly  conserved.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a respiratory virus that gains entry via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) within airway  epithelium. Patients exhibit a spectrum of respiratory symptoms from asymptomatic  to respiratory failure. Patient factors including obesity, tobacco use, and black  race are all associated with increased ACE2 expression and may contribute to  increased complications. Consolidation and ground-glass opacities on chest  imaging are typical but not specific for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).  Venous thromboembolism occurs infrequently when prophylactic anticoagulation is  provided. However, capillary microthrombosis is nearly ubiquitous, suggesting  that it contributes to hypoxemia. Remdesivir and glucocorticoids may benefit some  hospitalized patients. Many of those afflicted remain symptomatic two weeks  following diagnosis and continue to require health care. Total lung capacity,  diffusion capacity, and maximal oxygen consumption may be reduced for months in  some survivors. Lung transplant offers chronically critically ill patients new  hope, and this option may have increasing potential for outpatients with  COVID-19-associated fibrosis.

AB  - Since the start of the pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 has already infected more than 250 million people globally, with more than five million fatal cases and huge  socio-economic losses. In addition to corticosteroids, and antiviral drugs like  remdesivir, various immunotherapies including monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to S  protein of SARS-CoV-2 have been investigated to treat COVID-19 patients. These  mAbs were initially developed against the wild-type SARS-CoV-2; however,  emergence of variant forms of SARS-CoV-2 having mutations in the spike protein in  several countries including India raised serious questions on the potential use  of these mAbs against SARS-CoV-2 variants. In this study, using an in silico  approach, we have examined the binding abilities of eight mAbs against several  SARS-CoV-2 variants of Alpha (B.1.1.7) and Delta (B.1.617.2) lineages. The  structure of the Fab region of each mAb was designed in silico and subjected to  molecular docking against each mutant protein. mAbs were subjected to two levels  of selection based on their binding energy, stability, and conformational  flexibility. Our data reveal that tixagevimab, regdanvimab, and cilgavimab can  efficiently neutralize most of the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha strains while tixagevimab,  bamlanivimab, and sotrovimab can form a stable complex with the Delta variants.  Based on these data, we have designed, by in silico, a chimeric antibody by  conjugating the CDRH3 of regdanivimab with a sotrovimab framework to combat the  variants that could potentially escape from the mAb-mediated neutralization. Our  finding suggests that though currently available mAbs could be used to treat  COVID-19 caused by the variants of SARS-CoV-2, better results could be expected  with the chimeric antibodies.

AB  - Brilacidin, a mimetic of host defense peptides (HDPs), is currently in Phase 2 clinical trial as an antibiotic drug candidate. A recent study reported that  brilacidin has antiviral activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome  coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by inactivating the virus. In this study, we  discovered an additional mechanism of action of brilacidin by targeting heparan  sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) on the host cell surface. Brilacidin, but not  acetyl brilacidin, inhibits the entry of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus into multiple  cell lines, and heparin, an HSPG mimetic, abolishes the inhibitory activity of  brilacidin on SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus cell entry. In addition, we found that  brilacidin has broad-spectrum antiviral activity against multiple human  coronaviruses (HCoVs) including HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-NL63. Mechanistic  studies revealed that brilacidin has a dual antiviral mechanism of action  including virucidal activity and binding to coronavirus attachment factor HSPGs  on the host cell surface. Brilacidin partially loses its antiviral activity when  heparin was included in the cell cultures, supporting the host-targeting  mechanism. Drug combination therapy showed that brilacidin has a strong  synergistic effect with remdesivir against HCoV-OC43 in cell culture. Taken  together, this study provides appealing findings for the translational potential  of brilacidin as a broad-spectrum antiviral for coronaviruses including  SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To clarify the work done by using AI for identifying the genomic sequences, development of drugs and vaccines for COVID-19 and to recognize the  advantages and challenges of using such technology. METHODS: A non-systematic  review was done. All articles published on Pub-Med, Medline, Google, and Google  Scholar on AI or digital health regarding genomic sequencing, drug development,  and vaccines of COVID-19 were scrutinized and summarized. RESULTS: The sequence  of SARS- CoV-2 was identified with the help of AI. It can help also in the prompt  identification of variants of concern (VOC) as delta strains and Omicron.  Furthermore, there are many drugs applied with the help of AI. These drugs  included Atazanavir, Remdesivir, Efavirenz, Ritonavir, and Dolutegravir, PARP1  inhibitors (Olaparib and CVL218 which is Mefuparib hydrochloride), Abacavir,  Roflumilast, Almitrine, and Mesylate. Many vaccines were developed utilizing the  new technology of bioinformatics, databases, immune-informatics, machine  learning, and reverse vaccinology to the whole SARS-CoV-2 proteomes or the  structural proteins. Examples of these vaccines are the messenger RNA and viral  vector vaccines. AI provides cost-saving and agility. However, the challenges of  its usage are the difficulty of collecting data, the internal and external  validation, ethical consideration, therapeutic effect, and the time needed for  clinical trials after drug approval. Moreover, there is a common problem in the  deep learning (DL) model which is the shortage of interpretability. CONCLUSION:  The growth of AI techniques in health care opened a broad gate for discovering  the genomic sequences of the COVID-19 virus and the VOC. AI helps also in the  development of vaccines and drugs (including drug repurposing) to obtain  potential preventive and therapeutic agents for controlling the COVID-19  pandemic.

TI  - 4'-Modified Nucleosides for Antiviral Drug Discovery: Achievements and Perspectives.
AU  - Chang, Junbiao
T2  - Accounts of chemical research
AB  - Modified nucleosides show therapeutic promise for antiviral therapies. However, issues including the emergence of drug resistance, toxicity, and coinfections  have posed new challenges for nucleoside-based antiviral drug discovery,  particularly in the era of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.  Chemical manipulation could impact the antiviral potency, safety, and drug  resistance of nucleosides. Generally, modified nucleosides are difficult to  recognize by intracellular important enzymes as substrates and thus exhibit low  toxicity. 4'-Modified nucleosides represent an important subclass of modified  nucleosides for antiviral therapies. To prevent the occurrence of drug  resistance, 4'-modified nucleosides should have 3'-OH, which should also be  chemically unreactive for proviral DNA biosynthesis. The absence of 3'-OH may  explain the occurrence of drug resistance for censavudine. The introduction of  4'-substituents improves enzymatic and acidic stability and makes the nucleosides  more lipophilic, thus improving cell permeability and bioavailability. Steric  hindrance between the 4'-substituent and 3'-OH changes the furanose conformation  to the 3'-endo type, in which the oxygen lone pair on the furanose ring could not  form an oxocarbonium ion for glycolysis. Currently, seven 4'-modified nucleoside  drug candidates such as azvudine (also known as FNC), islatravir, censavudine,  balapiravir, lumicitabine, AL-335, and 4-azidothymidine have progressed into  clinical stages for treating viral infections. Of note, FNC was officially  approved by NMPA in July 2021 for use in adult patients with high HIV-1 virus  loads (nos. H20210035 and H20210036), providing an alternative therapeutic for  patients with HIV-1. The long-term cellular retention of FNC suggests its  potential as a long-lasting pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) agent for preventing  HIV-1 infection. Mechanistically, FNC not only inhibited HIV-1 reverse  transcription and replication but also restored A3G expression in peripheral  blood CD4(+) T cells in HIV-1 patients receiving FNC. The 4'-azido group in  azvudine stabilizes the 3'-C-endo (north) conformation by steric effects and the  formation of an intramolecular hydrogen bond with the 3'-OH group, thus  decreasing the nucleophilicity of 3'-OH. The north conformation may also enhance  the phosphorylation efficiency of FNC by cellular kinases. Encouragingly, FNC,  islatravir, and balapiravir show promise for the treatment of coronaviruses, of  which FNC has advanced to phase 3 clinical trials in different countries to treat  patients with COVID-19 (clinical trial numbers: NCT04668235 and NCT04425772). FNC  cured the COVID-19 disease in almost all patients and showed better therapeutic  efficacy than remdesivir. In this Account, we provide an overview of 4'-modified  nucleoside analogs in clinical stages for antiviral therapies, highlighting the  drug discovery strategies, structure-activity relationship studies, and  preclinical/clinical studies and also give our perspectives on nucleoside-based  antiviral drug discovery.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a worldwide pandemic and is a threat to global health. Patients who experienced cytokine  storms tend to have a high mortality rate. However, to date, no study has  investigated the impact of cytokine storms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This  retrospective cohort study included only COVID-19 positive patients hospitalized  in a Private Hospital in West Jakarta between March and September 2020. All  patients were not vaccinated during this period and treatment was based on the  guidelines by the Ministry of Health Indonesia. A convenience sampling method was  used and all patients who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled. RESULTS: The  clinical outcome of COVID-19 patients following medical therapy was either cured  (85.7%) or died (14.3%), with 14.3% patients reported to have cytokine storm,  from which 23.1% led to fatalities. A plasma immunoglobulin (Gammaraas®) and/or  tocilizumab (interleukin-6 receptor antagonist; Actemra®) injection was utilised  to treat the cytokine storm while remdesivir and oseltamivir were administered to  ameliorate COVID-19. Most (61.5%) patients who experienced the cytokine storm  were male; mean age 60 years. Interestingly, all patients who experienced the  cytokine storm had hypertension or/ and diabetes complication (100%). Fever,  cough and shortness of breath were also the common symptoms (100.0%). Almost all  (92.3%) patients with cytokine storm had to be treated in the intensive care unit  (ICU). Most (76.9%) patients who had cytokine storm received hydroxychloroquine  and all had antibiotics [1) azithromycin + levofloxacin or 2) meropenam for  critically ill patients] and vitamins such as vitamins C and B-complex as well as  mineral. Unfortunately, from this group, 23.1% patients died while the remaining  70% of patients recovered. A significant (p<0.05) correlation was established  between cytokine storms and age, the presence of comorbidity, diabetes,  hypertension, fever, shortness of breath, having oxygen saturation (SPO2) less  than 93%, cold, fatigue, ward of admission, the severity of COVID-19 disease,  duration of treatment as well as the use of remdesivir, Actemra® and Gammaraas®.  Most patients recovered after receiving a combination treatment (oseltamivir +  remdesivir + Antibiotics + Vitamin/Mineral) for approximately 11 days with a 90%  survival rate. On the contrary, patients who received oseltamivir +  hydroxychloroquine + Gammaraas® + antibiotics +Vitamin/Mineral, had a 83%  survival rate after being admitted to the hospital for about ten days.  CONCLUSION: Factors influencing the development of a cytokine storm include age,  duration of treatment, comorbidity, symptoms, type of admission ward and severity  of infection. Most patients (76.92%) with cytokine storm who received  Gammaraas®/Actemra®, survived although they were in the severe and critical  levels (87.17%). Overall, based on the treatment duration and survival rate, the  most effective therapy was a combination of oseltamivir + favipiravir +  hydroxychloroquine + antibiotics + vitamins/minerals.

T2  - Advances in clinical and experimental medicine : official organ Wroclaw Medical University
AB  - Acute kidney injury occurs in about 30% of patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and is one of the most common extrapulmonary  complications of this disease. The highest risk of acute kidney injury is found  in hospitalized patients who require mechanical ventilation. The pathogenesis of  acute kidney injury in COVID-19 is multifactorial and seems to not be fully  understood. Both direct and indirect mechanisms of kidney injury caused by severe  acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) should be considered. The  histological picture of kidney specimens obtained from patients with acute kidney  injury in the course of COVID-19 is dominated by acute tubular necrosis. Some  patients also have acute interstitial nephritis, blood clots in the kidney  vessels and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (the variant with collapsing  vascular loops). Acute kidney injury in COVID-19 is primarily caused not by  direct viral effect, but by indirect pathophysiological mechanisms. The  histopathological findings in these patients does not differ from the majority of  the other patients with acute kidney injury. The main pathophysiological  mechanisms underlying acute kidney injury in COVID-19 are: hemodynamic  abnormalities, hypoxia and cytokine storm. The methods of treating the underlying  disease, i.e., COVID-19 in patients with acute kidney injury and those without  acute kidney injury are similar. However, it should be stressed that in the  treatment of COVID-19 accompanied by acute kidney injury, the contraindication to  remdesivir is estimated using glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <30 mL/min/1.73  m2. The general principles of management in patients with both, COVID-19 and  acute kidney injury do not differ from the principles of management in patients  with acute kidney injury due to the other causes.

AB  - Vaccines and antivirals are the classical weapons deployed to contain, prevent, and treat life-threatening viral illnesses. Specifically, for SARS-CoV-2  infection, vaccines protect against severe COVID-19 disease manifestations and  complications. However, waning immunity and emergence of vaccine escape mutants  remains a growing threat. This is highlighted by the current surge of the omicron  COVID-19 variant. Thus, there is a race to find treatment alternatives. We  contend that oral small molecule antivirals that halt SARSCoV- 2 infection are  essential. Compared to currently available monoclonal antibodies and remdesivir,  where parenteral administration is required, oral antivirals offer treatments in  an outpatient setting with dissemination available on a larger scale. In response  to this need at 2021's end, regulatory agencies provided emergency use  authorization for both molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir. These medicines act on the  viral polymerase and protease, respectively. Each is given for 5 days and can  reduce disease progression by 30% and 89%, respectively. The advent of additional  oral antivirals, the assessment of combination therapies, the formulation of  extended-release medications, and their benefit for both early treatment and  prophylaxis will likely transform the landscape of the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - COVID-19 has affected more or less every nation across the world and affected the economy very badly. Infection of this virus in human took the life of millions.  We have already faced the first and the second waves of COVID-19 and recently,  the nations or humanity is afraid of new strain, that is, OMICRON. Considered to  highly infectious than the previous strains. Therefore, the researchers are  working to find a promising molecule with no or permissible toxicity. In the  present work, authors have chosen 10 molecules including the molecules used in  curing the infection from nCoV. All the molecules were docked against Mpro of  nCoV using iGemdock, a reliable computational tool. Based on the binding energy  obtained, it can be seen that only latermovir; remdesivir; zanamivir showed  better binding affinity than the gamma oryzanol, the molecule of interest in this  work. These three molecules are already in use to cure the patients siffering  from the infection of nCoV. But, we need a cost effective and easily available  molecule to fight against this viral infection. The binding energy obtained for  the formation of complex of gamma oryzanol with Mpro of nCoV through molecular  docking is -118.787 kcal/mol. It forms conventional hydrogen bonds with the  CYS145 (2.51 Å), LEU141 (3.01 Å) and SER144 (3.09 Å); forms C-H bonds with PHE140  (3.37 Å) and HIS163 (2.91 Å), forms alkyl interactions with ALA191 (3.59 and 4.74  Å), CYS145 (4.90 Å). One interesting information is obtained that the value of  log Kp of gamma oryzanol is least means more permeable to skin in comparison of  other molecules used in the work. Gamma oryzanol in known for to its biological  potency like it can modulate the oxidative stress as well as inflammation. DFT  calculations of gamma oryzanol (GO) was made at different temperature and no  change in the delocalization of electron density as well no change in free energy  is observed. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of gamma oryzanol with the Mpro  of nCoV at different temperatures was performed. The formation of the complex  between GO and Mpro of CoV at 290 K, 300 K, 310 K and 320 K for 100 ns was  investigated. It has been observed that the effective binding is observed at  290 K, therefore, it can be said that the inhibition of the Mpro of nCoV with GO  is maximum at 290 K.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

AB  - The course of COVID-19 is unpredictable, ranging from asymptomatic to respiratory failure and death. Prognostic biomarkers are urgently needed. We hypothesized  that long pentraxin PTX3 could be a valuable plasma biomarker due to its  essential role in inflammatory processes. In a prospective hospitalized COVID-19  derivation cohort (n = 126) during the spring of 2020, we measured PTX3 within 4  days of admission. The predictive value of mechanical ventilation (MV) and 30-day  mortality compared with clinical parameters and other markers of inflammation  were assessed by logistic regression analysis and expressed as odds ratio (OR)  with 95% confidence interval (CI). Analyses were repeated in a prospective  validation cohort (n = 112) of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 treated with  remdesivir and dexamethasone. Thirty-day mortality in the derivation cohort was  26.2%. In patients who died, the median PTX3 concentration upon admission was  19.5 ng/mL (IQR: 12.5-33.3) versus 6.6 ng/mL (IQR 2.9-12.3) (p < 0.0001) for  survivors. After adjustment for covariates, the odds of 30-day mortality  increased two-fold for each doubling of PTX3 (OR 2.03 [95% CI: 1.23-3.34], p =  0.006), which was also observed in the validation cohort (OR 1.70 [95% CI:  1.09-2.67], p = 0.02). Similarly, PTX3 levels were associated with MV. After  adjustment for covariates, OR of MV was 2.34 (95% CI: 1.33-4.12, p = 0.003) in  the derivation cohort and 1.64 (95% CI: 1.03-2.62, p = 0.04) in the validation  cohort. PTX3 appears to be a useful clinical biomarker to predict 30-day  respiratory failure and mortality risk in COVID-19 patients treated with and  without remdesivir and dexamethasone.

TI  - Minimization of the Drug and Gene Interactions in Polypharmacy Therapies Augmented with COVID-19 Medications.
AU  - Lagumdzija-Kulenovic, Azra
AU  - Kulenovic, Adnan
T2  - Studies in health technology and informatics
AB  - Medications Dexamethasone, Remdesivir or Colchicine, used to treat COVID-19 patients, have significant interactions with other medications and the human  genome. The study presented in this paper investigates how to use the  Personalized Medicine Therapy Optimization Method (PM-TOM) to minimize these  interactions in polypharmacy therapies of COVID-19 patients. We applied PM-TOM on  the EMR database of Harvard Personal Genome Project (PGP), drug database DrugBank  and Comprehensive Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) to analyze polypharmacy therapies  augmented with these medications. The main finding is that these COVID-19  medications significantly increase the drug and gene interactions in partially  optimized (or unoptimized) therapies, which is not the case in the fully  optimized ones. For example, the test results show that in polypharmacy  treatments for patients having between 3 and 8 conditions, the average number of  drug and gene interactions in partially optimized therapies ranges from 3 to 18  after adding Remdesivir, 4.3 to 20 Colchicine, and 4.7 to 23 Dexamethasone. On  the other hand, these interactions in fully optimized therapies range only 0.6 to  5.2, 1.2 to 7, and 2.7 to 11, respectively. These results suggest that  polypharmacy therapies should be carefully examined before adding these  medications. This recommendation applies to all other situations when  polypharmacy patients may conduct new serious conditions, such as COVID-19,  requiring additional medications with a high number of drug and gene  interactions.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Renal transplant recipients with severe COVID-19 may have sequelae that can affect their quality of life and can have poor patient and graft  outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective, observational study  between April 1, 2020, and December 31, 2020, to assess patient and graft  outcomes and quality of life using the EQ-5D quality of life survey score at  baseline and at follow-up of at least 12 weeks. RESULTS: Of the 3100 renal  transplant recipients with follow-up, 104 patients had COVID-19. Of these  patients, 75 (72.1%) had mild-moderate disease and 29 (27.9%) had severe disease.  In addition, 78 patients (75.0%) were hospitalized, with 43 patients (41.3%) in  the intensive care unit. Remdesivir was used in 46 of the 78 hospitalized  patients (58.9%) without any mortality benefitin the severe group. Sixteen  patients (17.5%) were rehospitalized with opportunistic infection (n = 7),  persistent graft dysfunction (n = 6), pulmonary sequelae (n = 2), and angina (n =  1). Thirteen patients (12.5%) died. On follow-up, the overall EQ-5D score was  significantly lower, particularly the pain and anxiety/depression scores in  patients with mild-moderate disease, whereas all components of the EQ-5D score  were significantly affected in patients with severe COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Renal  transplant recipients with severe COVID-19 are at high risk of mortality, acute  graft dysfunction, and residual disability, severely affecting their quality of  life score and requiring rehabilitation.

AB  - Background and Objectives: The incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has increased in Wakayama, Japan, due to the spread of the highly infectious  B.1.1.7 variant. Before this event, the medical systems were almost unaffected.  We aimed to assess the clinical characteristics of patients hospitalized with  COVID-19 and the risk factors for therapeutic intervention of remdesivir during  the fourth pandemic period in Wakayama, Japan. Materials and Methods: This  single-center retrospective study enrolled 185 patients with mild to moderate  COVID-19 hospitalized in our hospital without intensive care between 14 March and  31 May 2021. Results: In this period, 125 (67.6%) of the 185 patients had the  B.1.1.7 variant. Sixty-three patients (34.1%) required remdesivir treatment. Age  upon admission and length of hospitalization were significantly different between  remdesivir treatment and careful observation groups (mean (standard deviation);  59.6 (14.7) versus 45.3 (20.6) years; p < 0.001 and median (interquartile range);  10 (9-12) versus 9 (8-10) years; p < 0.001). One patient was transferred to  another hospital because of disease progression. At hospital admission, age ≥60  years (odds ratio (OR) 6.90, p < 0.001), a previous history of diabetes mellitus  (OR 20.9, p = 0.002), B.1.1.7 variant (OR 5.30; p = 0.005), lower respiratory  symptoms (OR 3.13, p = 0.011), headache (OR 3.82, p = 0.011), and fever ≥37.5 °C  (OR 4.55, p = 0.001) were independent risk factors to require remdesivir  treatment during the admission. Conclusions: Many patients with mild to moderate  COVID-19 required the therapeutic intervention of remdesivir during the fourth  pandemic period in Wakayama, Japan. From the clinical data obtained at admission,  these risk factors could contribute to a prediction regarding the requirement of  remdesivir treatment in cases of mild to moderate COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Molnupiravir is a newer oral antiviral drug that has recently received emergency use authorization (EUA) in USA, UK and India. We aim  to conduct an update on our previous systematic review to provide practical  clinical guideline for using molnupiravir in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We  systematically searched the electronic database of PubMed, MedRxiv and Google  Scholar until January 5, 2022, using key MeSH keywords. RESULTS: Final result of  phase 3 study in 1433 non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients showed a significant  reduction in composite risk of hospital admission or death (absolute risk  difference, -3.0% [95% confidence interval {CI}, -5.9 to -0.1%]; 1-sided  P = 0.02) although with a non-significant 31% relative risk reduction (RRR). RRR  for death alone was 89% (95% CI, 14 to 99; P-value not reported). Number needed  to treat to prevent 1 death or 1 hospitalization or death composite appears to be  closely competitive to other agents having EUA in people with COVID-19. However,  cost-wise molnupiravir is comparatively cheaper compared to all other agents.  CONCLUSION: Molnupiravir could be a useful agent in non-pregnant unvaccinated  adults with COVID-19 who are at increased risk of severity including  hospitalization. However, it is effective only when used within 5-days of onset  of symptoms. A 5-days course seems to be safe without any obvious short-term side  effects.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has magnified longstanding health care and social inequities, resulting in disproportionately high COVID-19-associated illness and  death among members of racial and ethnic minority groups (1). Equitable use of  effective medications (2) could reduce disparities in these severe outcomes (3).  Monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapies against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes  COVID-19, initially received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the Food and  Drug Administration (FDA) in November 2020. mAbs are typically administered in an  outpatient setting via intravenous infusion or subcutaneous injection and can  prevent progression of COVID-19 if given after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result  or for postexposure prophylaxis in patients at high risk for severe illness.(†)  Dexamethasone, a commonly used steroid, and remdesivir, an antiviral drug that  received EUA from FDA in May 2020, are used in inpatient settings and help  prevent COVID-19 progression(§) (2). No large-scale studies have yet examined the  use of mAb by race and ethnicity. Using COVID-19 patient electronic health record  data from 41 U.S. health care systems that participated in the PCORnet, the  National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network,(¶) this study assessed  receipt of medications for COVID-19 treatment by race (White, Black, Asian, and  Other races [including American Indian or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Other  Pacific Islander, and multiple or Other races]) and ethnicity (Hispanic or  non-Hispanic). Relative disparities in mAb** treatment among all patients(††)  (805,276) with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result and in dexamethasone and  remdesivir treatment among inpatients(§§) (120,204) with a positive SARS-CoV-2  test result were calculated. Among all patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 test  results, the overall use of mAb was infrequent, with mean monthly use at 4% or  less for all racial and ethnic groups. Hispanic patients received mAb 58% less  often than did non-Hispanic patients, and Black, Asian, or Other race patients  received mAb 22%, 48%, and 47% less often, respectively, than did White patients  during November 2020-August 2021. Among inpatients, disparities were different  and of lesser magnitude: Hispanic inpatients received dexamethasone 6% less often  than did non-Hispanic inpatients, and Black inpatients received remdesivir 9%  more often than did White inpatients. Vaccines and preventive measures are the  best defense against infection; use of COVID-19 medications postexposure or  postinfection can reduce morbidity and mortality and relieve strain on hospitals  but are not a substitute for COVID-19 vaccination. Public health policies and  programs centered around the specific needs of communities can promote health  equity (4). Equitable receipt of outpatient treatments, such as mAb and antiviral  medications, and implementation of prevention practices are essential to reducing  existing racial and ethnic inequities in severe COVID-19-associated illness and  death.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of remdesivir in the treatment of patients in hospital with COVID-19 remains ill defined in a global context. The World Health Organization  Solidarity randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluated remdesivir in patients  across many countries, with Canada enrolling patients using an expanded data  collection format in the Canadian Treatments for COVID-19 (CATCO) trial. We  report on the Canadian findings, with additional demographics, characteristics  and clinical outcomes, to explore the potential for differential effects across  different health care systems. METHODS: We performed an open-label, pragmatic RCT  in Canadian hospitals, in conjunction with the Solidarity trial. We randomized  patients to 10 days of remdesivir (200 mg intravenously [IV] on day 0, followed  by 100 mg IV daily), plus standard care, or standard care alone. The primary  outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included changes in  clinical severity, oxygen- and ventilator-free days (at 28 d), incidence of new  oxygen or mechanical ventilation use, duration of hospital stay, and adverse  event rates. We performed a priori subgroup analyses according to duration of  symptoms before enrolment, age, sex and severity of symptoms on presentation.  RESULTS: Across 52 Canadian hospitals, we randomized 1282 patients between Aug.  14, 2020, and Apr. 1, 2021, to remdesivir (n = 634) or standard of care (n =  648). Of these, 15 withdrew consent or were still in hospital, for a total sample  of 1267 patients. Among patients assigned to receive remdesivir, in-hospital  mortality was 18.7%, compared with 22.6% in the standard-of-care arm (relative  risk [RR] 0.83 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.67 to 1.03), and 60-day mortality  was 24.8% and 28.2%, respectively (95% CI 0.72 to 1.07). For patients not  mechanically ventilated at baseline, the need for mechanical ventilation was 8.0%  in those assigned remdesivir, and 15.0% in those receiving standard of care (RR  0.53, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.75). Mean oxygen-free and ventilator-free days at day 28  were 15.9 (± standard deviation [SD] 10.5) and 21.4 (± SD 11.3) in those  receiving remdesivir and 14.2 (± SD 11) and 19.5 (± SD 12.3) in those receiving  standard of care (p = 0.006 and 0.007, respectively). There was no difference in  safety events of new dialysis, change in creatinine, or new hepatic dysfunction  between the 2 groups. INTERPRETATION: Remdesivir, when compared with standard of  care, has a modest but significant effect on outcomes important to patients and  health systems, such as the need for mechanical ventilation. Trial registration:  ClinicalTrials.gov, no. NCT04330690.

AB  - Remdesivir is a broad-spectrum antiviral agent able to inhibit the RNA polymerase of SARS-CoV-2. At present, studies focusing on the effect of remdesivir on viral  load (VL) are few and with contrasting results. Aim of the present study was to  evaluate the effect of remdesivir on SARS-CoV-2 VL from nasopharyngeal swabs  (cycle threshold criterion) in a sample of patients treated with the drug,  compared with patients who did not receive the antiviral treatment. This  retrospective analysis evaluated patients with (1) real-time polymerase chain  reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis and (2) availability of at least  two positive nasopharyngeal swabs analysed with the same analytic platform (ORF  target gene, Ingenius ELITe, ELITechGroup, Puteaux, France). Upper respiratory  specimens from nasopharyngeal swabs were collected at admission (T0) and 7-14  days after treatment, upon clinical decision. A total of 27 patients treated with  remdesivir (Group A) met the inclusion criteria and were compared with 18  patients (Group B) treated with standard care, matched for baseline clinical  characteristics. At baseline, both remdesivir-treated and nontreated patients  showed comparable VLs (21.73 ± 6.81 vs. 19.27 ± 5.24, p = 0.348). At the second  swab, remdesivir-treated patients showed a steeper VL reduction with respect to  controls (34.28 ± 7.73 vs. 27.22 ± 3.92; p < 0.001). Longitudinal linear model  estimated a mean decrease in cycle threshold equal to 0.61 (SE: 0.09) per day in  remdesivir-treated versus 0.33 (SE: 0.10) per day in remdesivir nontreated  patients (p for heterogeneity = 0.045). The present study shows that the  administration of remdesivir in hospitalized COVID-19 patients significantly  reduces the VL on nasopharyngeal swabs.

AB  - Recently, remdesivir and molnupiravir were approved for treating COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, little is known about the impact of these drugs  on other viruses preexisted in COVID-19 patients. Here we report that remdesivir  but not molnupiravir induced lytic reactivation of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated  herpesvirus (KSHV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), two major oncogenic  herpesviruses. Remdesivir induced mature virion production from latently infected  cells. Mechanistic studies showed that remdesivir induced KSHV and EBV  reactivation by regulating several intracellular signaling pathways.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The process of drug discovery and development is expensive, complex, timeconsuming, and risky. There are different techniques involved in the process  of drug development, including random screening, computational approaches,  molecular manipulation, and serendipitous research. Among these methods, the  computational approach is considered an efficient strategy to accelerate and  economize the drug discovery process. OBJECTIVE: This approach is mainly applied  in various phases of the drug discovery process, including target identification,  target validation, lead identification, and lead optimization. Due to the  increase in the availability of information regarding various biological targets  of different disease states, computational approaches such as molecular docking,  de novo design, molecular similarity calculation, virtual screening,  pharmacophore-based modeling, and pharmacophore mapping have been applied  extensively. METHODS: Various drug molecules can be designed by applying  computational tools to explore the drug candidates for the treatment of  Coronavirus infection. The World Health Organization announced the coronavirus  disease as COVID-19 and declared it a global pandemic on 11 February 2020.  Therefore, it is thought of interest to the scientific community to apply  computational methods to design and optimize the pharmacological properties of  various clinically available and FDA-approved drugs such as remdesivir,  ribavirin, favipiravir, oseltamivir, ritonavir, arbidol, chloroquine,  hydroxychloroquine, carfilzomib, baraticinib, prulifloxacin, etc., for effective  treatment of COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: Further, various survey reports suggest  that extensive studies are carried out by various research communities to find  out the safety and efficacy profile of these drug candidates. CONCLUSION: This  review is focused on the study of various aspects of these drugs related to their  target sites on the virus, binding interactions, physicochemical properties, etc.

AB  - The outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic COVID-19 created by its severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) variant, known for producing a  very severe acute respiratory syndrome, has created an unprecedented situation by  its continual assault around the world. The crisis caused by the SARS-CoV-2  variant has been a global challenge, calling to mitigate this unprecedented  pandemic that has engulfed the whole world. Since the outbreak and spread of  COVID-19, many researchers globally have been grappling to find new clinically  trialed active drugs with anti-COVID-19 activity, from antimalarial drugs to JAK  inhibitors, antiviral drugs, immune suppressants, and so forth. This article  presents a brief discussion on the activity and synthesis of some active  molecules such as favipiravir, hydroxychloroquine, pirfenidone, remdesivir,  lopinavir, camostat, chloroquine, baricitinib, molnupiravir, and so forth, which  are under trial.

TI  - Metadichol®: A Novel Nanolipid Formulation That Inhibits SARS-CoV-2 and a Multitude of Pathological Viruses In Vitro.
AU  - Raghavan, Palayakotai R.
T2  - BioMed research international
AB  - Increasing outbreaks of new pathogenic viruses have promoted the exploration of novel alternatives to time-consuming vaccines. Thus, it is necessary to develop a  universal approach to halt the spread of new and unknown viruses as they are  discovered. One such promising approach is to target lipid membranes, which are  common to all viruses and bacteria. The ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome  coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has reaffirmed the importance of interactions  between the virus envelope and the host cell plasma membrane as a critical  mechanism of infection. Metadichol®, a nanolipid emulsion of long-chain alcohols,  has been demonstrated as a strong candidate that inhibits the proliferation of  SARS-CoV-2. Naturally derived substances, such as long-chain saturated lipid  alcohols, reduce viral infectivity, including that of coronaviruses (such as  SARS-CoV-2) by modifying their lipid-dependent attachment mechanism to human host  cells. The receptor ACE2 mediates the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the host cells,  whereas the serine protease TMPRSS2 primes the viral S protein. In this study,  Metadichol® was found to be 270 times more potent an inhibitor of TMPRSS2 (EC(50)  = 96 ng/mL) than camostat mesylate (EC(50) = 26000 ng/mL). Additionally, it  inhibits ACE with an EC(50) of 71 ng/mL, but it is a very weak inhibitor of ACE2  at an EC(50) of 31 μg/mL. Furthermore, the live viral assay performed in Caco-2  cells revealed that Metadichol® inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication at an EC(90) of  0.16 μg/mL. Moreover, Metadichol® had an EC(90) of 0.00037 μM, making it 2081 and  3371 times more potent than remdesivir (EC(50) = 0.77 μM) and chloroquine (EC(50)  = 1.14 μM), respectively.

AB  - The nsp3 macrodomain and nsp12 (RdRp) enzymes are strongly implicated in the virulent regulation of the host immune response and viral replication of  SARS-CoV-2, making them plausible therapeutic targets for mitigating infectivity.  Remdesivir remains the only FDA-approved small-molecule inhibitor of the nsp12 in  clinical conditions while none has been approved yet for the nsp3 macrodomain. In  this study, 69,067 natural compounds from the IBScreen database were screened for  efficacious potentials with mechanistic multitarget-directed inhibitory  pharmacology against the dual targets using in silico approaches. Standard and  extra precision (SP and XP) Maestro glide docking analyses were employed to  evaluate their inhibitory interactions against the enzymes. Four compounds,  STOCK1N-45901, 03804, 83408, 08377 consistently showed high XP scores against the  respective targets and interacted strongly with pharmacologically essential amino  acid and RNA residues, in better terms than the standard, co-crystallized  inhibitors, GS-441524 and remdesivir. Further assessments through the predictions  of ADMET and mutagenicity distinguished STOCK1N-45901, a natural derivative of  o-hydroxybenzoate as the most promising candidate. The ligand maintained a good  conformational and thermodynamic stability in complex with the enzymes throughout  the trajectories of 100 ns molecular dynamics, indicated by RMSD, RMSF and radius  of gyration plots. Its binding free energy, MM-GBSA was recorded as -54.24 and  -31.77 kcal/mol against the respective enzyme, while its structure-activity  relationships confer high probabilities as active antiviral, anti-inflammatory,  antiinfection, antitussive and peroxidase inhibitor. The IBScreen database  natural product, STOCK1N-45901 (2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexyl o-hydroxybenzoate) is  thus recommended as a potent inhibitor of dual nsp3 and nsp12 of SARS-CoV-2 for  further study.

AB  - AIMS: Estimate the clinical and economic benefits of lenzilumab plus standard of care (SOC) compared with SOC alone in the treatment of patients hospitalized with  COVID-19 pneumonia from the United States (US) hospital perspective. MATERIALS  AND METHODS: A per-patient cost calculator was developed to report the clinical  and economic benefits associated with adding lenzilumab to SOC in newly  hospitalized COVID-19 patients over 28 days. Clinical inputs were based on the  LIVE-AIR trial, including failure to achieve survival without ventilation (SWOV),  mortality, time to recovery, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and invasive  mechanical ventilation (IMV) use. Base case costs included the anticipated list  price of lenzilumab, drug administration, and hospital resource costs based on  the level of care required. A scenario analysis examined projected one-year  rehospitalization costs. RESULTS: In the base case and all scenarios, lenzilumab  plus SOC improved all specified clinical outcomes relative to SOC alone.  Lenzilumab plus SOC resulted in estimated cost savings of $3,190 per patient in a  population aged <85 years with C-reactive protein (CRP) levels <150 mg/L and  receiving remdesivir (base case). Per-patient cost savings were observed in the  following scenarios: (1) aged <85 years with CRP <150 mg/L, with or without  remdesivir ($1,858); (2) Black and African American patients with CRP <150 mg/L  ($13,154); and (3) Black and African American patients from the full population,  regardless of CRP level ($2,763). In the full modified intent-to-treat  population, an additional cost of $4,952 per patient was estimated. When adding  rehospitalization costs to the index hospitalization, a total per-patient cost  savings of $5,154 was estimated. CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight the clinical  benefits for SWOV, ventilator use, time to recovery, mortality, time in ICU, and  time on IMV, in addition to an economic benefit from the US hospital perspective  associated with adding lenzilumab to SOC for COVID-19 patients.

AB  - Massive usage of antiviral compounds during a pandemic creates an ideal ground for emergence of resistant strains. Remdesivir, a broad-spectrum inhibitor of the  viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), was extensively prescribed under  emergency use authorization during the first 18 months of the COVID19 pandemic,  before randomized controlled trials showed poor efficacy in hospitalized  patients. RdRp mutations conferring resistance to remdesivir are well known from  in vitro studies, and the huge SARS-CoV-2 sequencing effort during the ongoing  COVID19 pandemic represents an unprecedented opportunity to assess emergence and  fitness of antiviral resistance in vivo. We mined the GISAID database to  extrapolate the frequency of remdesivir escape mutations. Our analysis reveals  very low levels of remdesivir resistance worldwide despite massive usage.

AB  - Mefenamic acid is a non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drug exhibiting a wide range of anti‑inflammatory, antipyretic, analgesic and probable antiviral activities.  The present study evaluated the efficacy of treatment with mefenamic acid  combined with standard medical care vs. standard medical care plus a placebo in  ambulatory patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19; nasal/oropharyngeal  swabs reverse transcription‑PCR test results positive for severe acute  respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). The present study is a phase II prospective,  two‑arm, parallel‑group, randomized, double‑blind placebo‑controlled clinical  trial which analyzed 36 patients. Two aspects were evaluated during the 14‑day  follow‑up period: i) The time for reaching a patient acceptable symptom state  (PASS), and ii) the last day of each COVID‑19 symptom presentation. Adverse  effects were evaluated. The clinical severity for all the patients in the study  was mild (88.9%) and moderate (11.1%). The control (placebo) group achieved PASS  on day 8.0±1.3, compared with day 4.4±0.8 in the mefenamic acid group (P=0.020,  Kaplan‑Meier analyses using log‑rank tests). Patients that received mefenamic  acid plus standard medical care had a ~16‑fold higher probability of achieving  PASS on day 8 (adjusted RR, 15.57; 95% CI, 1.22‑198.71; P=0.035), compared with  the placebo plus standard medical care group. All symptoms lasted for fewer days  in the mefenamic acid group, compared with the placebo group; however, only the  symptoms of headache (P=0.008), retro‑orbital eye pain (P=0.049), and sore throat  (P=0.029) exhibited statistically significant differences. The experimental  treatment produced no severe adverse effects. On the whole, the present study  demonstrates that the administration of mefenamic acid markedly reduced the  symptomatology and time to reach PASS in ambulatory patients with COVID‑19. Due  to its probable antiviral effects and potent anti‑inflammatory mechanisms,  mefenamic acid may prove to be useful in the treatment of COVID‑19, in  combination with other drugs, including the new antivirals (remdesivir,  molnupiravir, or favipiravir). However, future studies are also required to  confirm these findings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Covid-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom has seen two waves; the first starting in March 2020 and the second in late October 2020. It is not known  whether outcomes for those admitted with severe Covid were different in the first  and second waves. METHODS: The study population comprised all patients admitted  to a 1,500-bed London Hospital Trust between March 2020 and March 2021, who  tested positive for Covid-19 by PCR within 3-days of admissions. Primary outcome  was death within 28-days of admission. Socio-demographics (age, sex, ethnicity),  hypertension, diabetes, obesity, baseline physiological observations, CRP,  neutrophil, chest x-ray abnormality, remdesivir and dexamethasone were  incorporated as co-variates. Proportional subhazards models compared mortality  risk between wave 1 and wave 2. Cox-proportional hazard model with propensity  score adjustment were used to compare mortality in patients prescribed remdesivir  and dexamethasone. RESULTS: There were 3,949 COVID-19 admissions, 3,195 hospital  discharges and 733 deaths. There were notable differences in age, ethnicity,  comorbidities, and admission disease severity between wave 1 and wave 2.  Twenty-eight-day mortality was higher during wave 1 (26.1% versus 13.1%).  Mortality risk adjusted for co-variates was significantly lower in wave 2  compared to wave 1 [adjSHR 0.49 (0.37, 0.65) p<0.001]. Analysis of treatment  impact did not show statistically different effects of remdesivir [HR 0.84 (95%CI  0.65, 1.08), p = 0.17] or dexamethasone [HR 0.97 (95%CI 0.70, 1.35) p = 0.87].  CONCLUSION: There has been substantial improvements in COVID-19 mortality in the  second wave, even accounting for demographics, comorbidity, and disease severity.  Neither dexamethasone nor remdesivir appeared to be key explanatory factors,  although there may be unmeasured confounding present.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It is unclear how acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-directed therapies are used in children with life-threatening COVID-19 in US hospitals. We  described characteristics of children hospitalized in the intensive care unit or  step-down unit (ICU/SDU) who received COVID-19-directed therapies and the  specific therapies administered. METHODS: Between March 15, 2020 and December 27,  2020, children <18 years of age in the ICU/SDU with acute COVID-19 at 48  pediatric hospitals in the United States were identified. Demographics,  laboratory values, and clinical course were compared in children who did and did  not receive COVID-19-directed therapies. Trends in COVID-19-directed therapies  over time were evaluated. RESULTS: Of 424 children in the ICU/SDU, 235 (55%)  received COVID-19-directed therapies. Children who received COVID-19-directed  therapies were older than those who did not receive COVID-19-directed therapies  (13.3 [5.6-16.2] vs 9.8 [0.65-15.9] years), more had underlying medical  conditions (188 [80%] vs 104 [55%]; difference = 25% [95% CI: 16% to 34%]), more  received respiratory support (206 [88%] vs 71 [38%]; difference = 50% [95% CI:  34% to 56%]), and more died (8 [3.4%] vs 0). Of the 235 children receiving  COVID-19-directed therapies, 172 (73%) received systemic steroids and 150 (64%)  received remdesivir, with rising remdesivir use over the study period (14% in  March/April to 57% November/December). CONCLUSION: Despite the lack of pediatric  data evaluating treatments for COVID-19 in critically ill children, more than  half of children requiring intensive or high acuity care received  COVID-19-directed therapies.

T2  - PloS one
AB  - Remdesivir and dexamethasone are the only drugs providing reductions in the lengths of hospital stays for COVID-19 patients. We assessed the impacts of  remdesivir on hospital-bed resources and budgets affected by the COVID-19  outbreak. A stochastic agent-based model was combined with epidemiological data  available on the COVID-19 outbreak in France and data from two randomized control  trials. Strategies involving treating with remdesivir only patients with low-flow  oxygen and patients with low-flow and high-flow oxygen were examined. Treating  all eligible low-flow oxygen patients during the entirety of the second wave  would have decreased hospital-bed occupancy in conventional wards by 4% [2%; 7%]  and intensive care unit (ICU)-bed occupancy by 9% [6%; 13%]. Extending remdesivir  use to high-flow-oxygen patients would have amplified reductions in ICU-bed  occupancy by up to 14% [18%; 11%]. A minimum remdesivir uptake of 20% was  required to observe decreases in bed occupancy. Dexamethasone had effects of  similar amplitude. Depending on the treatment strategy, using remdesivir would,  in most cases, generate savings (up to 722€) or at least be cost neutral (an  extra cost of 34€). Treating eligible patients could significantly limit the  saturation of hospital capacities, particularly in ICUs. The generated savings  would exceed the costs of medications.

AB  - There is an urgent need to understand how SARS-CoV-2 infects the airway epithelium and in a subset of individuals leads to severe illness or death.  Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provide a near limitless supply of human  cells that can be differentiated into cell types of interest, including airway  epithelium, for disease modeling. We present a human iPSC-derived airway  epithelial platform, composed of the major airway epithelial cell types, that is  permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Subsets of iPSC-airway cells express the  SARS-CoV-2 entry factors angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and  transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Multiciliated cells are the primary  initial target of SARS-CoV-2 infection. On infection with SARS-CoV-2, iPSC-airway  cells generate robust interferon and inflammatory responses, and treatment with  remdesivir or camostat mesylate causes a decrease in viral propagation and entry,  respectively. In conclusion, iPSC-derived airway cells provide a physiologically  relevant in vitro model system to interrogate the pathogenesis of, and develop  treatment strategies for, COVID-19 pneumonia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The antiviral drug GS-5734 remdesivir is a new phosphoramidate prodrug developed initially as a treatment for Ebola virus which then proved to  have antiviral properties against other viruses. After clinical trials, it was  the first antiviral to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in  2020 to treat severe coronavirus (COVID-19) cases. The widespread current  pandemic gave an urge to its fast production and marketing. Thus, new analytical  methods must be available for its analysis in a fast and easy manner with low  cost to be applicable in all laboratories. OBJECTIVE: In the current study, a  green and economic micellar electrokinetic chromatographic (MEKC) method is  proposed for remdesivir analysis. METHODS: A fused-silica capillary (58.5 cm ×  50 μm id, 50 cm effective length) with 20 mM borate buffer (pH 9) and 25 mM  sodium dodecyl sulfate was used under a positive potential of 30 kV at 25°C with  detection at 245 nm. RESULTS: Remdesivir analysis was achieved in approximately  5 min. The method proved to be linear in range of 1-50 μg/mL with correlation  coefficient, r > 0.999. CONCLUSION: The MEKC method proposed was applied to the  analysis of remdesivir in its commercial vials. The method was validated per  International Conference on Harmonization guidelines. HIGHLIGHTS: Green chemistry  has been the focus of the analytical community in the past few years. This method  is considered green due to its low energy and solvent consumption without  sacrificing the method's sensitivity or selectivity. The method's green profile  has been assessed by different greenness assessment scales to ensure the method  is eco-friendly and can be used in the pharmaceutical industry.

AB  - When developing drugs against SARS-CoV-2, it is important to consider the characteristics of patients with different co-morbidities. People infected with  HIV-1 are a particularly vulnerable group, as they may be at a higher risk than  the general population of contracting COVID-19 with clinical complications. For  such patients, drugs with a broad spectrum of antiviral activity are of paramount  importance. Glycyrrhizinic acid (Glyc) and its derivatives are promising  biologically active compounds for the development of such broad-spectrum  antiviral agents. In this work, derivatives of Glyc obtained by acylation with  nicotinic acid were investigated. The resulting preparation, Glycyvir, is a  multi-component mixture containing mainly mono-, di-, tri- and tetranicotinates.  The composition of Glycyvir was characterized by HPLC-MS/MS and its toxicity  assessed in cell culture. Antiviral activity against three strains of SARS-CoV-2  was tested in vitro on Vero E6 cells by MTT assay. Glycyvir was shown to inhibit  SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro (IC(50)2-8 μM) with an antiviral activity  comparable to the control drug Remdesivir. In addition, Glycyvir exhibited marked  inhibitory activity against HIV pseudoviruses of subtypes B, A6 and the  recombinant form CRF63_02A (IC(50) range 3.9-27.5 µM). The time-dependence of  Glycyvir inhibitory activity on HIV pseudovirus infection of TZM-bl cells  suggested that the compound interfered with virus entry into the target cell.  Glycyvir is a promising candidate as an agent with low toxicity and a broad  spectrum of antiviral action.

AB  - The manuscript reports the green-chemical synthesis of a new diindole-substituted benzimidazole compound, B1 through a straightforward route in coupling between  indolyl-3-carboxaldehyde and o-phenylenediamine in water medium under the aerobic  condition at 75 ºC. The single crystal X-ray structural analysis of B1 suggests  that the disubstituted benzimidazole compound crystallizes in a monoclinic system  and the indole groups exist in a perpendicular fashion with respect to  benzimidazole moiety. The SARS-CoV-2 screening activity has been studied against  1 × 10e4 VeroE6 cells in a dose-dependent manner following Hoechst 33342 and  nucleocapsid staining activity with respect to remdesivir. The compound exhibits  92.4% cell viability for 30 h and 35.1% inhibition against VeroE6 cells at  non-cytotoxic concentration. Molecular docking studies predict high binding  propensities of B1 with the main protease (M(pro)) and non-structural (nsp2 and  nsp7-nsp8) proteins of SARS-CoV-2 through a number of non-covalent interactions.  Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation analysis for 100 ns confirms the formation of  stable conformations of B1-docked proteins with significant changes of binding  energy, attributing the potential inhibition properties of the synthetic  benzimidazole scaffold against SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Controlling excessive cytokine secretion is a crucial therapeutic strategy for managing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Patients on dialysis are at a high  risk of severe disease, given abnormal immune responses that can lead to  prolonged inflammation. Moreover, patients undergoing dialysis have limited  treatment options, as neither remdesivir nor baricitinib is available. The novel  neutralizing monoclonal antibody cocktail REGEN-COV (formerly known as REGN-COV2;  casirivimab/imdevimab), recently approved in Japan, is a promising drug for  preventing severe diseases. However, there are few reports regarding its use in  patients undergoing dialysis in Japan. Herein, we report the safe use of antibody  cocktail therapy in patients with COVID-19 on hemodialysis receiving maintenance  dialysis in Japan. Infusion reactions were not observed during administration.  Due to the increasing number of patients with COVID-19 and the limited capacity  of the healthcare system, antibody cocktail therapy needs to be enhanced.  Antibody cocktail therapy for severe diseases can be safely administered to  patients undergoing dialysis who do not require supplemental oxygen.

AB  - The current COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus contains  a single linear RNA segment that serves as a template for transcription and  replication, leading to the synthesis of positive and negative-stranded viral RNA  (vRNA) in infected cells. Tools to visualize vRNA directly in infected cells are  critical to analyze the viral replication cycle, screen for therapeutic  molecules, or study infections in human tissue. Here, we report the design,  validation, and initial application of FISH probes to visualize positive or  negative RNA of SARS-CoV-2 (CoronaFISH). We demonstrate sensitive visualization  of vRNA in African green monkey and several human cell lines, in patient samples  and human tissue. We further demonstrate the adaptation of CoronaFISH probes to  electron microscopy. We provide all required oligonucleotide sequences, source  code to design the probes, and a detailed protocol. We hope that CoronaFISH will  complement existing techniques for research on SARS-CoV-2 biology and COVID-19  pathophysiology, drug screening, and diagnostics.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Real-world data on safety and clinical outcomes of remdesivir in COVID-19 management is scant. We present findings of data analysis conducted for  assessing the safety and clinical outcomes of remdesivir treatment for COVID-19  in India. METHODS: This retrospective analysis used data from an active  surveillance programme database of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 who were  receiving remdesivir. RESULTS: Of the 2329 patients included, 67.40% were men.  Diabetes (29.69%) and hypertension (20.33%) were the most common comorbidities.  At remdesivir initiation, 2272 (97.55%) patients were receiving oxygen therapy.  Remdesivir was administered for 5 days in 65.38% of patients. Antibiotics  (64.90%) and steroids (47.90%) were the most common concomitant medications.  Remdesivir was overall well tolerated, and total 119 adverse events were  reported; most common were nausea and vomiting in 45.40% and increased liver  enzymes in 14.28% patients. 84% of patients were cured/improved, 6.77% died and  9.16% showed no improvement in their clinical status at data collection. Subgroup  analyses showed that the mortality rate was significantly lower in  patients < 60 years old than in those > 60 years old. Amongst patients on oxygen  therapy, the cure/improvement rate was significantly higher in those receiving  standard low-flow oxygen than in those receiving mechanical ventilation,  non-invasive ventilation, or high-flow oxygen. Factors that were associated with  higher mortality were age > 60 years, cardiac disease, diabetes high flow oxygen,  non-invasive ventilation and mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSION: Our analysis  showed that remdesivir is well tolerated and has an acceptable safety profile.  The clinical outcome of cure/improvement was 84%, with a higher improvement in  patients < 60 years old and on standard low-flow oxygen.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is generally asymptomatic or mild in otherwise healthy children, however, severe cases may occur. In this study, we  report the clinical characteristics of children classified as critical COVID-19  in Korea to provide further insights into risk factors and management in  children. METHODS: This study was a retrospective case series of children < 18  years of age classified as critical COVID-19. Cases were identified by the Korea  Disease Control and Prevention Agency surveillance system and medical records  were reviewed. Critical COVID-19 was defined as cases with severe illness  requiring noninvasive (high flow nasal cannula, continuous positive airway  pressure, or bilevel positive airway pressure) or invasive mechanical  ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or continuous renal  replacement therapy (CRRT), between January 20, 2020 and October 7, 2021.  RESULTS: Among 39,146 cases diagnosed with COVID-19 in subjects < 18 years of  age, eight cases (0.02%) were identified as critical COVID-19. The median age was  13 years (range 10 month-17 years) and male-to-female ratio was 1:1. Three  children had underlying diseases; one child has asthma and major depressive  disorder, one child had Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and one child had mental  retardation and was newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus with the  diagnosis of COVID-19. Among the eight children, seven were obese (body mass  index range [BMI] median 29.3, range 25.9-38.2, weight-for-length > 97% for  infant) and one was overweight (BMI 21.3). All patients had fever, six patients  had dyspnea or cough and other accompanied symptoms included sore throat,  headache, lethargy and myalgia. Radiologic findings showed pneumonia within 1-8  days after symptom onset. Pneumonia progressed in these children for 2-6 days and  was improved within 5-32 days after diagnosis. Among the eight critical cases,  remdesivir was administered in six cases. Steroids were provided for all cases.  Inotropics were administered in one case. Six cases were treated with noninvasive  mechanical ventilator and three required mechanical ventilator. One case required  ECMO due to acute respiratory distress syndrome. All cases were admitted to the  intensive care unit and admission period ranged from 9-39 days. Among all  critical COVID-19 cases < 18 years of age, there were no fatal cases. CONCLUSION:  To develop appropriate policies for children in the COVID-19 pandemic, it is  important to monitor and assess the clinical burden in this population.

AU  - Parums, Dinah V.
T2  - Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research
AB  - On 4th November 2021, the first oral antiviral drug for COVID-19, molnupiravir (Lagevrio®), received full regulatory approval from the Medicines and Healthcare  Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the UK. Molnupiravir is an orally  bioavailable antiviral drug for use at home when a SARS-CoV-2 test is positive.  On 22nd December 2022, the FDA granted emergency use authorization (EUA) for the  oral antiviral drug, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid®) for adults and children  with mild and moderate COVID-19 at increased risk of progression to severe  COVID-19. These regulatory drug approvals come at a crucial time when new  variants of concern of the SARS-CoV-2 virus are spreading rapidly. Although the  FDA approved remdesivir (Veklury®) on 22nd October 2020 for use in adults and  children for the treatment of COVID-19 requiring hospitalization, its use has  been limited by the requirement for intravenous administration in a healthcare  facility. The four FDA-approved therapeutic neutralizing monoclonal antibodies,  imdevimab, bamlanivimab, etesevimab, and casirivimab are costly and also require  medically-supervised intravenous administration. The availability of effective,  low-cost oral antiviral drugs available in a community setting that can be used  at an early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection is now a priority in controlling  COVID-19. An increasing number of repurposed antiviral drugs are currently under  investigation or in the early stages of regulatory approval. This Editorial aims  to present an update on the current status of orally bioavailable antiviral drug  treatments for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - Remdesivir (RDV) is a nucleotide analog prodrug with demonstrated clinical benefit in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In October 2020,  the US FDA approved intravenous (IV) RDV as the first treatment for hospitalized  COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, RDV has been approved or authorized for emergency  use in more than 50 countries. To make RDV more convenient for non-hospitalized  patients earlier in disease, alternative routes of administration are being  evaluated. Here, we investigated the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of RDV  administered by head dome inhalation in African green monkeys (AGM). Relative to  an IV administration of RDV at 10 mg/kg, an approximately 20-fold lower dose  administered by inhalation produced comparable concentrations of the  pharmacologically active triphosphate in lower respiratory tract tissues.  Distribution of the active triphosphate into the upper respiratory tract was also  observed following inhaled RDV exposure. Inhalation RDV dosing resulted in lower  systemic exposures to RDV and its metabolites as compared with IV RDV dosing. An  efficacy study with repeated dosing of inhaled RDV in an AGM model of SARS-CoV-2  infection demonstrated reductions in viral replication in bronchoalveolar lavage  fluid and respiratory tract tissues compared with placebo. Efficacy was observed  with inhaled RDV administered once daily at a pulmonary deposited dose of 0.35  mg/kg beginning approximately 8 hours post-infection. Moreover, the efficacy of  inhaled RDV was similar to that of IV RDV administered once at 10 mg/kg followed  by 5 mg/kg daily in the same study. Together, these findings support further  clinical development of inhalation RDV.

AB  - PURPOSE: Safety of remdesivir in patients with renal impairment is unknown. Incidence of liver injury secondary to remdesivir is also unknown. The objective  of this study is to assess the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) and to  trend the liver enzymes during remdesivir treatment and change in eGFR from  baseline to end of treatment as well as 48 h post completion of remdesivir  therapy. METHODS: This is a retrospective chart review study including adult  patients admitted with COVID-19 receiving remdesivir with a baseline eGFR < 30  ml/min per 1.73 m^2 from December 2020 to May 2021. The primary outcome was to  assess the incidence of AKI and hepatic injury. The secondary outcome was to  assess the efficacy of remdesivir defined by change in oxygen requirement.  RESULTS: Seventy-one patients were included in the study. Patients experienced an  improvement in eGFR from baseline (T0) to end of remdesivir treatment (T1), as  well as 48 h after the end of the treatment (T2) ( + 30.3% and + 30.6%  respectively, P < .0001). Creatinine reduced from baseline (T0) to T1 and T2  (-20.9% and -20.5% respectively, P < .0001). Creatinine clearance improved from  baseline to T1 and T2 ( + 26.6% and + 26.2% respectively, p < .0001). Elevation  of aminotransferase (AST) was observed at T1 ( + 2.5%, P  =  .727), however, AST  reduction was seen at T2 (-15.8%, P  =  .021). Elevation in alanine transaminase  (ALT) was observed at T1 and T2 ( + 25% and + 12%, P  =  .004 and P  =  .137  respectively). Both direct and total bilirubin remained stable and were not  significantly changed from baseline. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that remdesivir  use in renally-impaired patients with eGFR < 30 ml/min is safe. Remdesivir may be  considered as a therapeutic option in this population with COVID-19 infection.

AB  - The epidemic of COVID-19 spread quickly through China and engulfed all of the countries across the globe. Several advances have been made in understanding the  novel coronavirus's pathophysiology and in the development of newer diagnostics  with pinpoint accuracy. Several newer therapeutic methods have either been  accepted or are awaiting acceptance. In many countries, vaccination programs have  been rolled out. Despite all these efforts, coronavirus still exists, though with  lesser propensity. Multiple new forms of the novel coronavirus unexpectedly  appeared in various areas of the world, undermining previously existing diagnosis  and care protocols. This article highlights our understanding of the novel  coronavirus's symptoms in brief, pathogenesis, diagnostics, and therapeutic  strategies to contain COVID-19. The clinical findings, including serological,  radiological, and other advanced diagnostic strategies, contributed much to  control the disease. To date, supportive interventions have been used in tandem  with potent antiviral therapies such as remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, or  corticosteroids with a level of trust in the care of COVID-19 patients. However,  in several areas of the world, vaccination initiatives took place; the vaccines'  safety and efficacy to control the outbreak is yet to be identified. This review  concludes that improvement in therapies and diagnostics for COVID-19 must  continually be explored as new variants constantly emerge.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Remdesivir (GS-5734) has emerged as a promising drug during the challenging times of COVID-19 pandemic. Being a prodrug, it undergoes several  metabolic reactions before converting to its active triphosphate metabolite. It  is important to establish the atomic level details and explore the energy profile  of the prodrug to drug conversion process. METHODS: In this work, Density  Functional Theory (DFT) calculations were performed to explore the entire  metabolic path. Further, the potential energy surface (PES) diagram for the  conversion of prodrug remdesivir to its active metabolite was established. The  role of catalytic triad of Hint1 phosphoramidase enzyme in P-N bond hydrolysis  was also studied on a model system using combined molecular docking and quantum  mechanics approach. RESULTS: The overall energy of reaction is 11.47 kcal/mol  exergonic and the reaction proceeds through many steps requiring high activation  energies. In the absence of a catalyst, the P-N bond breaking step requires 41.78  kcal/mol, which is reduced to 14.26 kcal/mol in a catalytic environment.  CONCLUSION: The metabolic pathways of model system of remdesivir (MSR) were  explored completely and potential energy surface diagrams at two levels of  theory, B3LYP/6-311++G(d, p) and B3LYP/6-31+G(d), were established and compared.  The results highlight the importance of an additional water molecule in the  metabolic reaction. The PN bond cleavage step of the metabolic process requires  the presence of an enzymatic environment.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a global crisis. Clinical  candidates with high efficacy, ready availability, and that do not develop  resistance are in urgent need. Despite that screening to repurpose clinically  approved drugs has provided a variety of hits shown to be effective against  SARS-CoV-2 infection in cell culture, there are few confirmed antiviral  candidates in vivo. In this study, 94 compounds showing high antiviral activity  against SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells were identified from 2,580 FDA-approved  small-molecule drugs. Among them, 24 compounds with low cytotoxicity were  selected, and of these, 17 compounds also effectively suppressed SARS-CoV-2  infection in HeLa cells transduced with human ACE2. Six compounds disturb  multiple processes of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. Their prophylactic efficacies  were determined in vivo using Syrian hamsters challenged with SARS-CoV-2  infection. Seven compounds reduced weight loss and promoted weight regain of  hamsters infected not only with the original strain but also the D614G variant.  Except for cisatracurium, six compounds reduced hamster pulmonary viral load, and  IL-6 and TNF-α mRNA when assayed at 4 d postinfection. In particular, sertraline,  salinomycin, and gilteritinib showed similar protective effects as remdesivir in  vivo and did not induce antiviral drug resistance after 10 serial passages of  SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, suggesting promising application for COVID-19 treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Remdesivir improves clinical outcomes in patients hospitalized with moderate-to-severe coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). Whether the use of  remdesivir in symptomatic, nonhospitalized patients with Covid-19 who are at high  risk for disease progression prevents hospitalization is uncertain. METHODS: We  conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving  nonhospitalized patients with Covid-19 who had symptom onset within the previous  7 days and who had at least one risk factor for disease progression (age ≥60  years, obesity, or certain coexisting medical conditions). Patients were randomly  assigned to receive intravenous remdesivir (200 mg on day 1 and 100 mg on days 2  and 3) or placebo. The primary efficacy end point was a composite of  Covid-19-related hospitalization or death from any cause by day 28. The primary  safety end point was any adverse event. A secondary end point was a composite of  a Covid-19-related medically attended visit or death from any cause by day 28.  RESULTS: A total of 562 patients who underwent randomization and received at  least one dose of remdesivir or placebo were included in the analyses: 279  patients in the remdesivir group and 283 in the placebo group. The mean age was  50 years, 47.9% of the patients were women, and 41.8% were Hispanic or Latinx.  The most common coexisting conditions were diabetes mellitus (61.6%), obesity  (55.2%), and hypertension (47.7%). Covid-19-related hospitalization or death from  any cause occurred in 2 patients (0.7%) in the remdesivir group and in 15 (5.3%)  in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.03 to  0.59; P = 0.008). A total of 4 of 246 patients (1.6%) in the remdesivir group and  21 of 252 (8.3%) in the placebo group had a Covid-19-related medically attended  visit by day 28 (hazard ratio, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.56). No patients had died  by day 28. Adverse events occurred in 42.3% of the patients in the remdesivir  group and in 46.3% of those in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: Among  nonhospitalized patients who were at high risk for Covid-19 progression, a 3-day  course of remdesivir had an acceptable safety profile and resulted in an 87%  lower risk of hospitalization or death than placebo.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In a randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trial, bamlanivimab, a SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing monoclonal antibody, given in combination with  remdesivir, did not improve outcomes among hospitalized patients with COVID-19  based on an early futility assessment. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the a priori  hypothesis that bamlanivimab has greater benefit in patients without detectable  levels of endogenous neutralizing antibody (nAb) at study entry than in those  with antibodies, especially if viral levels are high. DESIGN: Randomized,  placebo-controlled trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04501978). SETTING: Multicenter  trial. PATIENTS: Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 without end-organ failure.  INTERVENTION: Bamlanivimab (7000 mg) or placebo. MEASUREMENTS: Antibody, antigen,  and viral RNA levels were centrally measured on stored specimens collected at  baseline. Patients were followed for 90 days for sustained recovery (defined as  discharge to home and remaining home for 14 consecutive days) and a composite  safety outcome (death, serious adverse events, organ failure, or serious  infections). RESULTS: Among 314 participants (163 receiving bamlanivimab and 151  placebo), the median time to sustained recovery was 19 days and did not differ  between the bamlanivimab and placebo groups (subhazard ratio [sHR], 0.99 [95% CI,  0.79 to 1.22]; sHR > 1 favors bamlanivimab). At entry, 50% evidenced production  of anti-spike nAbs; 50% had SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid plasma antigen levels of at  least 1000 ng/L. Among those without and with nAbs at study entry, the sHRs were  1.24 (CI, 0.90 to 1.70) and 0.74 (CI, 0.54 to 1.00), respectively (nominal P for  interaction = 0.018). The sHR (bamlanivimab vs. placebo) was also more than 1 for  those with plasma antigen or nasal viral RNA levels above median level at entry  and was greatest for those without antibodies and with elevated levels of antigen  (sHR, 1.48 [CI, 0.99 to 2.23]) or viral RNA (sHR, 1.89 [CI, 1.23 to 2.91]).  Hazard ratios for the composite safety outcome (<1 favors bamlanivimab) also  differed by serostatus at entry: 0.67 (CI, 0.37 to 1.20) for those without and  1.79 (CI, 0.92 to 3.48) for those with nAbs. LIMITATION: Subgroup analysis of a  trial prematurely stopped because of futility; small sample size; multiple  subgroups analyzed. CONCLUSION: Efficacy and safety of bamlanivimab may differ  depending on whether an endogenous nAb response has been mounted. The limited  sample size of the study does not allow firm conclusions based on these findings,  and further independent trials are required that assess other types of passive  immune therapies in the same patient setting.

AB  - Several clinical trials started during the COVID-19 pandemic to discover effective therapeutics led to identify a few candidates from the major clinical  trials. However, in the past several months, quite a few SARS-CoV-2 variants have  emerged with significant mutations. Major mutations in the S-glycoprotein and  other parts of the genome have led to the antibody's escape to small  molecule-based therapeutic resistance. The mutations in S-glycoprotein trigger  the antibody escape/resistance, and mutations in RdRp might cause remdesivir  resistance. The article illustrates emerging mutations that have resulted in  antibody escape to therapeutics resistance. In this direction, the article  illustrates presently developed neutralizing antibodies (with their preclinical,  clinical stages) and antibody escapes and associated mutations. Finally, owing to  the RdRp mutations, the antiviral small molecules resistance is illustrated.

AB  - An unvaccinated adult male heart transplant recipient patient with recalcitrant COVID-19 due to SARS-CoV-2 delta variant with rising nasopharyngeal quantitative  viral load was successfully treated with ALVR109, an off-the-shelf  SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell therapy. Background immunosuppression included  0.1 mg/kg prednisone, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil 1 gm twice daily for  historical antibody-mediated rejection. Prior therapies included remdesivir,  corticosteroids, and tocilizumab, with requirement for high-flow nasal oxygen.  Lack of clinical improvement and acutely rising nasopharyngeal viral RNA more  than 3 weeks into illness prompted the request of ALVR109 through an emergency  IND. The day following the first ALVR109 infusion, the patient's nasopharyngeal  SARS-CoV-2 RNA declined from 7.43 to 5.02 log(10) RNA copies/ml. On post-infusion  day 4, the patient transitioned to low-flow oxygen. Two subsequent infusions of  ALVR109 were administered 10 and 26 days after the first; nasopharyngeal  SARS-CoV-2 RNA became undetectable on Day 11, and he was discharged the following  day on low-flow oxygen 5 weeks after the initial diagnosis of COVID-19. The  clinical and virologic improvements observed in this patient following  administration of ALVR109 suggest a potential benefit that warrants further  exploration in clinical trials.

AB  - During the pandemic, dexamethasone (DEX), remdesivir (RDV), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), thapsigargin (TG), camostat mesylate (CaM), and pralatrexate were  repurposed drugs for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the side  effects on the liver associated with the anti-COVID therapies are unknown.  Cellular stresses by these drugs at 0-30 μM were studied using HepG2, Huh7,  and/or primary human hepatocytes. DEX or RDV induced endoplasmic reticulum stress  with increased X-box binding protein 1 and autophagic response with increased  accumulation of microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3-II). DEX  and RDV had additive effects on the stress responses in the liver cells, which  further increased expression of activating transcription factor 4 and C/EBP  homology protein 1 (CHOP), and cell death. Alcohol pretreatment (50 mM) and DEX  induced greater cellular stress responses than DEX and RDV. Pralatrexate induced  Golgi fragmentation, cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase, activations of poly  (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP) and caspases, and cell death. Pralatrexate and  alcohol had synergistic effects on the cell death mediators of Bim, caspase3, and  PARP. The protease inhibitor CaM and TG induced autophagic response and  mitochondrial stress with altered mitochondrial membrane potential, B-cell  lymphoma 2, and cytochrome C. TG and HCQ induced autophagic response markers of  Unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase, LC3-II, Beclin1, and Atg5, and severe ER  stress marker CHOP. Conclusion: These results suggest that the anti-COVID-19  drugs, especially with drug-drug or alcohol-drug combinations, cause cellular  stress responses and injuries in the liver cells.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: There is clinical equipoise for COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) use in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To determine the safety  and efficacy of CCP compared with placebo in hospitalized patients with COVID-19  receiving noninvasive supplemental oxygen. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS:  CONTAIN COVID-19, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of CCP in  hospitalized adults with COVID-19, was conducted at 21 US hospitals from April  17, 2020, to March 15, 2021. The trial enrolled 941 participants who were  hospitalized for 3 or less days or presented 7 or less days after symptom onset  and required noninvasive oxygen supplementation. INTERVENTIONS: A unit of  approximately 250 mL of CCP or equivalent volume of placebo (normal saline). MAIN  OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was participant scores on the 11-point  World Health Organization (WHO) Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement on day 14  after randomization; the secondary outcome was WHO scores determined on day 28.  Subgroups were analyzed with respect to age, baseline WHO score, concomitant  medications, symptom duration, CCP SARS-CoV-2 titer, baseline SARS-CoV-2  serostatus, and enrollment quarter. Outcomes were analyzed using a bayesian  proportional cumulative odds model. Efficacy of CCP was defined as a cumulative  adjusted odds ratio (cOR) less than 1 and a clinically meaningful effect as cOR  less than 0.8. RESULTS: Of 941 participants randomized (473 to placebo and 468 to  CCP), 556 were men (59.1%); median age was 63 years (IQR, 52-73); 373 (39.6%)  were Hispanic and 132 (14.0%) were non-Hispanic Black. The cOR for the primary  outcome adjusted for site, baseline risk, WHO score, age, sex, and symptom  duration was 0.94 (95% credible interval [CrI], 0.75-1.18) with posterior  probability (P[cOR<1] = 72%); the cOR for the secondary adjusted outcome was 0.92  (95% CrI, 0.74-1.16; P[cOR<1] = 76%). Exploratory subgroup analyses suggested  heterogeneity of treatment effect: at day 28, cORs were 0.72 (95% CrI, 0.46-1.13;  P[cOR<1] = 93%) for participants enrolled in April-June 2020 and 0.65 (95% CrI,  0.41 to 1.02; P[cOR<1] = 97%) for those not receiving remdesivir and not  receiving corticosteroids at randomization. Median CCP SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing  titer used in April to June 2020 was 1:175 (IQR, 76-379). Any adverse events  (excluding transfusion reactions) were reported for 39 (8.2%) placebo recipients  and 44 (9.4%) CCP recipients (P = .57). Transfusion reactions occurred in 2 (0.4)  placebo recipients and 8 (1.7) CCP recipients (P = .06). CONCLUSIONS AND  RELEVANCE: In this trial, CCP did not meet the prespecified primary and secondary  outcomes for CCP efficacy. However, high-titer CCP may have benefited  participants early in the pandemic when remdesivir and corticosteroids were not  in use. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04364737.

T2  - Journal of medical virology
AB  - In this era, broad-spectrum prodrugs with anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) activities are gaining considerable attention owing to  their potential clinical benefits and role in combating the fast-spreading  coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The last 2 years have seen a surge  of reports on various broad-spectrum prodrugs against SARS-CoV-2, and in in vitro  studies, animal models, and clinical practice. Currently, only remdesivir (with  many controversies and limitations) has been approved by the U.S. FDA for the  treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and additional potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs  are urgently required to enrich the defense arsenals. The world has ubiquitously  grappled with the COVID-19 pandemic, and the availability of broad-spectrum  prodrugs provides great hope for us to subdue this global threat. This article  reviews promising treatment strategies, antiviral mechanisms, potential benefits,  and daunting clinical challenges of anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to provide some  important guidance for future clinical treatment.

AB  - The precocity and efficacy of the vaccines developed so far against COVID-19 has been the most significant and saving advance against the pandemic. The  development of vaccines has not prevented, during the whole period of the  pandemic, the constant search for therapeutic medicines, both among existing  drugs with different indications and in the development of new drugs. The  Scientific Committee of the COVID-19 of the Illustrious College of Physicians of  Madrid wanted to offer an early, simplified and critical approach to these new  drugs, to new developments in immunotherapy and to what has been learned from the  immune response modulators already known and which have proven effective against  the virus, in order to help understand the current situation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Subsequent to the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the Food and Drug Administration, Gilead Sciences Inc. donated a supply of remdesivir to the  United States government for immediate treatment of patients with COVID-19. The  Los Angeles County Emergency Medical Services Agency (LAC-EMS) was tasked with  the allocation. The objective of this study was to describe the process for  allocation and the patients who were treated with the donated remdesivir in LAC.  METHODS: LAC-EMS developed a strategic plan to distribute federal allocations of  remdesivir to LAC hospitals based on the proportion of patients admitted with  COVID-19 at each hospital. Criteria for treatment and its duration were based on  the EUA at local hospital discretion. Data were collected on patients treated  from May to December 2020. Variables included characteristics (age, sex,  race/ethnicity), hospital care (level of care and respiratory support at start of  treatment, ventilator support, total ventilator days), and outcomes (length of  intensive care (ICU) and hospital stay, survival to discharge, disposition). We  compared demographics of treated patients to the overall population of  hospitalized patients in LAC. RESULTS: LAC-EMS distributed 34,250 vials of  remdesivir in 7 allocations, which treated 5,376 patients. The median age was 60  (IQR 48-70); 62% were male, 59% Hispanic, 17% White, 6% Asian, 5% Black. Prior to  remdesivir, 96% of patients required respiratory support including 49%  supplemental oxygen, 35% high-flow nasal cannula, 3% continuous or bilevel  positive airway pressure and 9% mechanical ventilation, with one quarter of  patients in the ICU. Overall, 26% of patients were mechanically ventilated during  the hospitalization, median 11 days (IQR 8-23), while 41% required ICU care,  median 10 days (IQR 5-19). Median length of stay for all patients was 10 days  (IQR 7-18) with 4,218 patients (74%) surviving to discharge and 80% of survivors  discharged home. Compared with overall hospitalized patients with COVID-19,  treated patients more likely to be male and middle-aged, and less likely to be  Black. CONCLUSION: LAC-EMS's strategic plan to distribute donated remdesivir to  hospitals based on the number of inpatients with COVID-19 resulted in the  treatment of 5,376 patients of whom 74% survived to hospital discharge.

AB  - This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of different medications available at present for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. We  searched databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published up to April  30, 2021, with Chinese or English language restriction, of medications  recommended for patients (aged 18 years or older) with severe COVID-19 infection.  We extracted data on trials and patient characteristics, and the following  primary outcomes: all-cause mortality (ACM), and treatment-emergent adverse  events (TEAEs). We identified 1855 abstracts and of these included 15 RCTs  comprising 3073 participants through database searches and other sources. In  terms of efficacy, compared with the standard of care (SOC) group, no significant  decrease in ACM was found in α-lipoic acid, convalescent plasma (CP),  azithromycin, tocilizumab, methylprednisolone, interferon beta, CP/SOC, high  dosage sarilumab, low dosage sarilumab, remdesivir, lopinavir-ritonavir, auxora,  and placebo group. Compared with placebo, we found that a significant decrease in  ACM was only found in methylprednisolone (odds ratio [OR]: 0.16, 95% confidence  interval [CI]: 0.03-0.75]. With respect to TEAEs, the CP group showed lower TEAEs  than placebo (OR: 0.07, 95% CI: 0.01-0.58) or SOC (OR: 0.05, 95% CI: 0.01-0.42)  group for the therapy of severe COVID-19 patients. This study only demonstrated  that methylprednisolone was superior to placebo in treating patients with severe  COVID-19 infection. Meanwhile, this further confirmed that the safety of other  treatment interventions might be inferior to CP for the therapy of severe  COVID-19 patients.

AB  - Recently, multifunctional fish peptides (FWPs) have gained a lot of attention because of their different biological activities. In the present study, three  angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE-I) inhibitory peptides [Ala-Pro-Asp-Gly  (APDG), Pro-Thr-Arg (PTR), and Ala-Asp (AD)] were isolated and characterized from  ribbonfish protein hydrolysate (RFPH) and described their mechanism of action on  ACE activity. As per the results, peptide PTR showed ≈ 2 and 2.5-fold higher  enzyme inhibitory activity (IC(50) = 0.643 ± 0.0011 μM) than APDG (IC(50)  = 1.061 ± 0.0127 μM) and AD (IC(50) = 2.046 ± 0.0130 μM). Based on experimental  evidence, peptides were used for in silico analysis to check the inhibitory  activity of the main protease (PDB: 7BQY) of SARS-CoV-2. The results of the study  reveal that PTR (-46.16 kcal/mol) showed higher binding affinity than APDG  (-36.80 kcal/mol) and AD (-30.24 kcal/mol) compared with remdesivir (-30.64  kcal/mol). Additionally, physicochemical characteristics of all the isolated  peptides exhibited appropriate pharmacological properties and were found to be  nontoxic. Besides, 20 ns molecular dynamic simulation study confirms the rigid  nature, fewer confirmation variations, and binding stiffness of the peptide PTR  with the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, the present study strongly  suggested that PTR is the perfect substrate for inhibiting the main protease of  SARS-CoV-2 through the in silico study, and this potential drug candidate may  promote the researcher for future wet lab experiments.

AB  - The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 virus has resulted in a worldwide pandemic, but effective antiviral therapies are not widely available. To improve treatment  options, we conducted a high-throughput screen to uncover compounds that block  SARS-CoV-2 infection. A minimally pathogenic human betacoronavirus (OC43) was  used to infect physiologically-relevant human pulmonary fibroblasts (MRC5) to  facilitate rapid antiviral discovery in a preclinical model. Comprehensive  profiling was conducted on more than 600 compounds, with each compound arrayed  across 10 dose points. Our screening revealed several FDA-approved agents that  can attenuate both OC43 and SARS-CoV-2 viral replication, including lapatinib,  doramapimod, and 17-AAG. Importantly, lapatinib inhibited SARS-CoV-2 RNA  replication by over 50,000-fold. Further, both lapatinib and doramapimod could be  combined with remdesivir to improve antiviral activity in cells. These findings  reveal novel therapeutic avenues that could limit SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - BACKGROUNDSevere coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a dysregulated immune response, which can result in cytokine-release syndrome and  acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Patients with COVID-19-associated  ARDS have elevated free serum levels of the cytokine lymphotoxin-like inducible  protein that competes with glycoprotein D for herpesvirus entry on T cells  (LIGHT; also known as TNFSF14). Such patients may benefit from  LIGHT-neutralization therapy.METHODSThis randomized, double-blind, multicenter,  proof-of-concept trial enrolled adults hospitalized with COVID-19-associated  pneumonia and mild to moderate ARDS. Patients received standard of care plus a  single dose of a human LIGHT-neutralizing antibody (CERC-002) or placebo. The  primary endpoint was the proportion of patients receiving CERC-002 who remained  alive and free of respiratory failure through day 28. Safety was assessed via  adverse event monitoring.RESULTSFor most of the 83 enrolled patients, standard of  care included systemic corticosteroids (88.0%) or remdesivir (57.8%). A higher  proportion of patients remained alive and free of respiratory failure through day  28 after receiving CERC-002 (83.9%) versus placebo (64.5%; P = 0.044), including  in patients 60 years of age or older (76.5% vs. 47.1%, respectively; P = 0.042).  Mortality rates were 7.7% (CERC-002) and 14.3% (placebo) on day 28 and 10.8% and  22.5%, respectively, on day 60. Treatment-emergent adverse events were less  frequent with CERC-002 than placebo.CONCLUSIONFor patients with  COVID-19-associated ARDS, adding CERC-002 to standard-of-care treatment reduces  LIGHT levels and might reduce the risk of respiratory failure and death.TRIAL  REGISTRATIONClinicalTrials.gov NCT04412057.FUNDINGAvalo Therapeutics.

AB  - In this study, the therapeutic efficacy of quercetin in combination with remdesivir and favipiravir, were evaluated in severe hospitalized COVID-19  patients. Our main objective was to assess the ability of quercetin for  preventing the progression of the disease into critical phase, and reducing the  levels of inflammatory markers related to SARS-Cov-2 pathogenesis. Through an  open-label clinical trial, 60 severe cases were randomly divided into control and  intervention groups. During a 7-day period, patients in the control group  received antivirals, i.e., remdesivir or favipiravir, while the intervention  group was treated with 1000 mg of quercetin daily in addition to the antiviral  drugs. According to the results, taking quercetin was significantly associated  with partial earlier discharge and reduced serum levels of ALP, q-CRP, and LDH in  the intervention group. Furthermore, although the values were in normal range,  the statistical outputs showed significant increase in hemoglobin level and  respiratory rate in patients who were taking quercetin. Based on our  observations, quercetin is safe and effective in lowering the serum levels of  ALP, q-CRP, and LDH as critical markers involved in COVID-19 severity. However,  according to the non-significant borderline results in comparing the mortality,  the ICU-admission rate, and the duration of ICU-admission, further studies can be  helpful to compensate the limitations of our study and clarify the therapeutic  potential of quercetin in COVID-19 treatments.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The pathophysiology of COVID-19 includes immune-mediated hyperinflammation, which could potentially lead to respiratory failure and death.  Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is among cytokines that  contribute to the inflammatory processes. Lenzilumab, a GM-CSF neutralising  monoclonal antibody, was investigated in the LIVE-AIR trial to assess its  efficacy and safety in treating COVID-19 beyond available treatments. METHODS: In  LIVE-AIR, a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial,  hospitalised adult patients with COVID-19 pneumonia not requiring invasive  mechanical ventilation were recruited from 29 sites in the USA and Brazil and  were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive three intravenous doses of lenzilumab  (600 mg per dose) or placebo delivered 8 h apart. All patients received standard  supportive care, including the use of remdesivir and corticosteroids. Patients  were stratified at randomisation by age and disease severity. The primary  endpoint was survival without invasive mechanical ventilation to day 28 in the  modified intention-to-treat population (mITT), comprising all randomised  participants who received at least one dose of study drug under the documented  supervision of the principal investigator or sub-investigator. Adverse events  were assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This  trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04351152, and is completed.  FINDINGS: Patients were enrolled from May 5, 2020, until Jan 27, 2021. 528  patients were screened, of whom 520 were randomly assigned and included in the  intention-to-treat population. 479 of these patients (n=236, lenzilumab; n=243,  placebo) were included in the mITT analysis for the primary outcome. Baseline  demographics were similar between groups. 311 (65%) participants were males, mean  age was 61 (SD 14) years at baseline, and median C-reactive protein concentration  was 79 (IQR 41-137) mg/L. Steroids were administered to 449 (94%) patients and  remdesivir to 347 (72%) patients; 331 (69%) patients received both treatments.  Survival without invasive mechanical ventilation to day 28 was achieved in 198  (84%; 95% CI 79-89) participants in the lenzilumab group and in 190 (78%; 72-83)  patients in the placebo group, and the likelihood of survival was greater with  lenzilumab than placebo (hazard ratio 1·54; 95% CI 1·02-2·32; p=0·040). 68 (27%)  of 255 patients in the lenzilumab group and 84 (33%) of 257 patients in the  placebo group experienced at least one adverse event that was at least grade 3 in  severity based on CTCAE criteria. The most common treatment-emergent adverse  events of grade 3 or higher were related to respiratory disorders (26%) and  cardiac disorders (6%) and none led to death. INTERPRETATION: Lenzilumab  significantly improved survival without invasive mechanical ventilation in  hospitalised patients with COVID-19, with a safety profile similar to that of  placebo. The added value of lenzilumab beyond other immunomodulators used to  treat COVID-19 alongside steroids remains unknown. FUNDING: Humanigen.

AB  - The risk of zoonotic coronavirus spillover into the human population, as highlighted by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, demands the development of  pan-coronavirus antivirals. The efficacy of existing antiviral  ribonucleoside/ribonucleotide analogs, such as remdesivir, is decreased by the  viral proofreading exonuclease NSP14-NSP10 complex. Here, using a novel assay and  in silico modeling and screening, we identified NSP14-NSP10 inhibitors that  increase remdesivir's potency. A model compound, sofalcone, both inhibits the  exonuclease activity of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV in vitro, and  synergistically enhances the antiviral effect of remdesivir, suppressing the  replication of SARS-CoV-2 and the related human coronavirus OC43. The validation  of top hits from our primary screenings using cellular systems provides  proof-of-concept for the NSP14 complex as a therapeutic target.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this international multicentre study was to review potential drug-drug interactions (DDIs) for real-life coadministration of  combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) and coronavirus disease 2019  (COVID-19)-specific medications. METHODS: The Euroguidelines in Central and  Eastern Europe Network Group initiated a retrospective, observational cohort  study of HIV-positive patients diagnosed with severe acute respiratory  syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Data were collected through a  standardized questionnaire and DDIs were identified using the University of  Liverpool's interaction checker. RESULTS: In total, 524 (94.1% of 557) patients  received cART at COVID-19 onset: 117 (22.3%) were female, and the median age was  42 (interquartile range 36-50) years. Only 115 (21.9%) patients were  hospitalized, of whom 34 required oxygen therapy. The most frequent nucleoside  reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) backbone was tenofovir disoproxil fumarate  (TDF)/tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) with lamivudine or emtricitabine (XTC) (79.3%)  along with an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) (68.5%), nonnucleoside  reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) (17.7%), protease inhibitor (PI) (13.7%)  or other (2.5%). In total, 148 (28.2%) patients received COVID-19-specific  treatments: corticosteroids (15.7%), favipiravir (7.1%), remdesivir (3.1%),  hydroxychloroquine (2.7%), tocilizumab (0.6%) and anakinra (0.2%). In total, 62  DDI episodes were identified in 58 patients (11.8% of the total cohort and 41.9%  of the COVID-19-specific treatment group). The use of boosted PIs and  elvitegravir accounted for 43 DDIs (29%), whereas NNRTIs were responsible for 14  DDIs (9.5%). CONCLUSIONS: In this analysis from the Central and Eastern European  region on HIV-positive persons receiving COVID-19-specific treatment, it was  found that potential DDIs were common. Although low-dose steroids are mainly used  for COVID-19 treatment, comedication with boosted antiretrovirals seems to have  the most frequent potential for DDIs. In addition, attention should be paid to  NNRTI coadministration.

AB  - Remdesivir (REM) is the first antiviral drug (Veklury™) approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the therapy of COVID-19. Due to its poor water  solubility, the preparation of Veklury™ requires a suitable solubilizing  excipient at pH 2 conditions. For this purpose, the final formulation contains  the randomly substituted sulfobutylether-β-cyclodextrin (SBEβCD) as a complexing  agent. Herein, extensive NMR spectroscopic study with various cyclodextrin (CD)  derivatives were conducted to understand the interactions in SBEβCD - REM systems  at the molecular level. The pK(a) value of REM has been determined experimentally  for the first time, as the protonation state of the aminopyrrolo-triazine moiety  can play a key role in CD-REM inclusion complex formation as SBEβCD has permanent  negative charges. The UV-pH titration experiments yielded a pK(a) of 3.56, thus  the majority of REM bears a positive charge at pH 2.0. NMR experiments were  performed on β- and γCD derivatives to determine complex stabilities,  stoichiometries and structures. The stability constants were determined by  nonlinear curve fitting based on (1)H NMR titrations at pH 2.0, while Job's  method was used to determine the stoichiometries. βCD complexes were one order of  magnitude more stable than their γCD counterparts. Sulfobutylation resulted in a  significant increase in stability and the single isomer derivatives showed  unexpectedly high stability values (logK = 4.35 for REM - per-6-SBEβCD). In the  case of βCDs, the ethylbutyl-moiety plays a key role in complexation immersing  into the βCD cavity, while the phenoxy-moiety overtakes and drives the inclusion  of REM in the case of γCDs. This is the first comprehensive study of REM-CD  complexation, allowing the design of new CD derivatives with tailored  stabilities, thereby aiding the formulation or production and even the analytical  characterization of REM.

AB  - Since early 2020, scientists have strived to find an effective solution to fight SARS-CoV-2, in particular by developing reliable vaccines that inhibit the spread  of the disease and repurposing drugs for combatting its effects on the human  body. The antiviral prodrug Remdesivir is still the most widely used therapeutic  during the early stages of the infection. However, the current synthetic routes  rely on the use of protecting groups, air-sensitive reagents, and cryogenic  conditions, thus impeding a cost-efficient supply to patients. We have,  therefore, focused on the development of a straightforward, direct addition of  (hetero)arenes to unprotected sugars. Here we report a silylium-catalyzed and  completely stereoselective C-glycosylation that initially yields the open-chain  polyols, which can be selectively cyclized to provide either the kinetic  α-furanose or the thermodynamically favored β-anomer. The method significantly  expedites the synthesis of Remdesivir precursor GS-441524 after a subsequent  Mn-catalyzed C-H oxidation and deoxycyanation.

AB  - COVID-19 is a clinical outcome of viral infection emerged due to strain of beta coronavirus which attacks the type-2 pneumocytes in alveoli via  angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors. There is no satisfactory drug  developed against 'SARS-CoV2', highlighting an immediate necessity  chemotherapeutic repurposing plan COVID-19. Drug repurposing is a method of  selection of approved therapeutics for new use and is considered to be the most  effective drug finding strategy since it includes less time and cost to obtain  treatment compared to the de novo drug acquisition process. Several drugs such as  hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, teicoplanin, darunavir, ritonavir, nitazoxanide,  chloroquine, tocilizumab and favipiravir (FPV) showed their activity against  'SARS-CoV2' in vitro. This review has emphasized on repurposing of drugs, and  biologics used in clinical set up for targeting COVID-19 and to evaluate their  pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety with their future aspect. The key  benefit of drug repurposing is the wealth of information related to its safety,  and easy accessibility. Altogether repurposing approach allows access to  regulatory approval as well as reducing sophisticated safety studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to a global pandemic since its emergence from Wuhan, China, in December of 2019. As research  continues to evolve, there is a paucity of reports describing the management and  treatment of COVID-19 in patients with acute kidney failure and End-Stage Renal  Disease (ESRD). These patients have increased susceptibility to developing severe  clinical symptoms from SARS-CoV-2 infection due to their underlying  comorbidities. Remdesivir has emerged as a promising antiviral drug against  SARS-CoV-2. However, data regarding the clinical benefits of remdesivir in  patients with severe renal impairment is unavailable as they have been excluded  from clinical trials due to the risk of sulfobutylether-β-cyclodextrin (SBECD)  accumulation in patients with eGFR<30 ml/min per 1.73m(2). CASE PRESENTATION: We  present the first case of a 47-year-old male with end-stage renal disease who was  successfully treated with remdesivir during hospitalization for acute respiratory  distress syndrome and respiratory failure arising from COVID-19. The worsening  clinical progress of the patient despite intensive care and treatment with  intravenous azithromycin therapy led to the decision to utilize remdesivir after  a risk-benefit analysis, despite his eGFR being <15 ml/min per 1.73m(2). Although  the patient developed reversible hepatotoxicity, marked improvement of symptoms  was observed after the five-day course of remdesivir was completed. CONCLUSION:  Our findings describe the first instance of compassionate use of remdesivir for  the treatment of COVID-19 in the setting of end-stage renal disease, acute  respiratory distress syndrome, and hypoxemic respiratory failure.

AB  - Research activities with infectious severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are currently permitted only under biosafety level 3 (BSL3)  containment. Here, we report the development of a single-cycle infectious  SARS-CoV-2 virus replicon particle (VRP) system with a luciferase and green  fluorescent protein (GFP) dual reporter that can be safely handled in BSL2  laboratories to study SARS-CoV-2 biology. The spike (S) gene of SARS-CoV-2  encodes the envelope glycoprotein, which is essential for mediating infection of  new host cells. Through deletion and replacement of this essential S gene with a  luciferase and GFP dual reporter, we have generated a conditional SARS-CoV-2  mutant (ΔS-VRP) that produces infectious particles only in cells expressing a  viral envelope glycoprotein of choice. Interestingly, we observed more efficient  production of infectious particles in cells expressing vesicular stomatitis virus  (VSV) glycoprotein G [ΔS-VRP(G)] than in cells expressing other viral  glycoproteins, including S. We confirmed that infection from ΔS-VRP(G) is limited  to a single round and can be neutralized by anti-VSV serum. In our studies with  ΔS-VRP(G), we observed robust expression of both luciferase and GFP reporters in  various human and murine cell types, demonstrating that a broad variety of cells  can support intracellular replication of SARS-CoV-2. In addition, treatment of  ΔS-VRP(G)-infected cells with either of the anti-CoV drugs remdesivir (nucleoside  analog) and GC376 (CoV 3CL protease inhibitor) resulted in a robust decrease in  both luciferase and GFP expression in a drug dose- and cell-type-dependent  manner. Taken together, our findings show that we have developed a single-cycle  infectious SARS-CoV-2 VRP system that serves as a versatile platform to study  SARS-CoV-2 intracellular biology and to perform high-throughput screening of  antiviral drugs under BSL2 containment. IMPORTANCE Due to the highly contagious  nature of SARS-CoV-2 and the lack of immunity in the human population, research  on SARS-CoV-2 has been restricted to biosafety level 3 laboratories. This has  greatly limited participation of the broader scientific community in SARS-CoV-2  research and thus has hindered the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs.  By deleting the essential spike gene in the viral genome, we have developed a  conditional mutant of SARS-CoV-2 with luciferase and fluorescent reporters, which  can be safely used under biosafety level 2 conditions. Our single-cycle  infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus replicon system can serve as a versatile platform to  study SARS-CoV-2 intracellular biology and to perform high-throughput screening  of antiviral drugs under BSL2 containment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The definition of 'long-COVID syndrome' (LCS) is still debated and describes the persistence of symptoms after viral clearance in hospitalized or  non-hospitalized patients affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). AIM:  In this study, we examined the prevalence and the risk factors of LCS in a cohort  of patients with previous COVID-19 and followed for at least 6 months of  follow-up. DESIGN: We conducted a prospective study including all hospitalized  patients affected by COVID-19 at our center of Infectious Diseases (Vercelli,  Italy) admitted between 10 March 2020 and 15 January 2021 for at least 6 months  after discharge. Two follow-up visits were performed: after 1 and 6 months after  hospital discharge. Clinical, laboratory and radiological data were recorded at  each visit. RESULTS: A total of 449 patients were included in the analysis. The  LCS was diagnosed in 322 subjects at Visit 1 (71.7%) and in 206 at Visit 2  (45.9); according to the post-COVID-19 functional status scale we observed 147  patients with values 2-3 and 175 with values >3 at Visit 1; at Visit 2, 133  subjects had the score between 2-3 and 73 > 3. In multivariate analysis,  intensive care unit (ICU) admission (OR = 2.551; 95% CI = 1.998-6.819;  P = 0.019), time of hospitalization (OR = 2.255; 95% CI = 1.018-6.992; P = 0.016)  and treatment with remdesivir (OR = 0.641; 95% CI = 0.413-0.782; P < 0.001) were  independent predictors of LCS. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with remdesivir leads to a  35.9% reduction in LCS rate in follow-up. Severity of illness, need of ICU  admission and length of hospital stay were factor associated with the persistence  of PCS at 6 months of follow-up.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Internationally, healthcare systems are confronted by an ever-increasing scarcity of medical resources due to the ongoing novel  coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The aim of this study was to  investigate the impact of remdesivir on the demand of hospital bed capacities for  hospitalized COVID-19 patients and to evaluate the potentially created capacities  for treating additional COVID-19 patients or elective treatments at the hospital.  METHODS: An epidemiological model was developed that utilized the population of  Cologne (Germany) during the first COVID-19 wave (first hospitalized patient-30  September 2020) to compare two scenarios: no administration of remdesivir (A) and  the administration of remdesivir according to the EMA label (B). The results of  the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial were used to evaluate the potential impact  of remdesivir on hospital capacity. RESULTS: With the first recorded patient on 2  March 2020, a total of 576 COVID-19 hospitalized patients were detected during  the first wave in Cologne. Comparing both scenarios (A versus B) of the model,  the administration of remdesivir increased the number of discharges from 259 to  293 (+5.8%) and fewer patients needed ICU admission [214 versus 178 (-6.3%)]. In  addition, the model estimated 20 fewer deaths (scenario B). Based on a reduced  length of stay, 31.4 hospital beds (57.0 versus 25.6) could have been freed by  administering remdesivir to eligible patients. This would have allowed either the  treatment of an additional 730 COVID-19 patients or 660 elective treatments.  CONCLUSIONS: In our model, remdesivir administration profoundly contributed to  free hospital capacities in the metropolitan city Cologne in Germany.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The emergence of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, and the subsequent global epidemic of COVID-19, brought with it innumerable new clinical experiences across  all medical specialties, and psychiatry is no exception. Individuals with serious  mental illness, in particular schizophrenia and related disorders, may be  especially susceptible to coronavirus infection given the overlapping risk  factors of vulnerable sociodemographic status, increased challenges with  quarantining requirements, and limited compliance with "respiratory etiquette."  The case presented here describes a patient with schizophrenia who was being  managed on clozapine and who developed symptomatic COVID-19 infection. Special  care was taken to ensure that potential interactions between clozapine and the  associated COVID-19 treatments were safe for the patient's mental and physical  wellbeing. CASE PRESENTATION: A 71-year-old schizophrenic Caucasian male is being  managed with clozapine. While hospitalized, the patient was screened positive for  COVID-19 and was admitted to the ICU due to his declining respiratory status. He  was treated with both remdesivir and prednisone. He was able to fully recover  from his COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION: The authors review the clinical  characteristics of the case, highlighting both the overlapping synergistic  effects and antagonistic influences of clozapine therapy in combination with  COVID-19 and its associated treatments. A review of the literature offers an  opportunity to examine various frameworks for individualized clinical  decision-making while making the case for greater epidemiologic research into the  optimal management of individuals with a psychotic disorder who are diagnosed  with COVID-19 infection.

AB  - Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is a neuropeptide that is produced by the lymphoid cells and plays a major role in immunological functions for controlling  the homeostasis of the immune system. VIP has been identified as a potent  anti-inflammatory factor, in boosting both innate and adaptive immunity. Since  December 2019, SARS-Cov-2 was found responsible for the disease COVID-19 which  has spread worldwide. No specific therapies or 100% effective vaccines are yet  available for the treatment of COVID-19. Drug repositioning may offer a strategy  and several drugs have been repurposed, including lopinavir/ritonavir,  remdesivir, favipiravir, and tocilizumab. This paper describes the main  pharmacological properties of synthetic VIP drug (Aviptadil) which is now under  clinical trials. A patented formulation of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide  (VIP), named RLF-100 (Aviptadil), was developed and finally got approved for  human trials by FDA in 2001 and in European medicines agency in 2005. It was  awarded Orphan Drug Designation in 2001 by the US FDA for the treatment of acute  respiratory distress syndrome and for the treatment of pulmonary arterial  hypertension in 2005. Investigational new drug (IND) licenses for human trials of  Aviptadil was guaranteed by both the US FDA and EMEA. Preliminary clinical trials  seem to support Aviptadil's benefit. However, such drugs like Aviptadil in  COVID-19 patients have peculiar safety profiles. Thus, adequate clinical trials  are necessary for these compounds.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The global COVID-19 pandemic is currently underway. A massive worldwide vaccination campaign is still underway, representing the most promising  weapon available to stop the pandemic. METHODS AND RESULTS: However, research  continues to investigate the most effective drug treatments to reduce and avoid  the most serious complications caused by COVID-19 infection. Recently, new  evidence of good therapeutic efficacy against COVID-19 has emerged for the  antiviral Remdesivir and the immunomodulatory Baricitinib, also in combination.  The first one showed SARS-CoV-2 antireplicative activity, the second one useful  to reduce the hyperinflammatory state caused by cytokine storm in the most severe  phases of the infection. CONCLUSIONS: In this short communication we describe the  molecular pharmacological mechanisms and the latest evidence for the use of these  therapeutic agents in the treatment of COVID-19 infection.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has killed millions of people and continues to cause massive global upheaval. Coronaviruses are  positive-strand RNA viruses with an unusually large genome of ~30 kb. They  express an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and a cohort of other replication enzymes  and supporting factors to transcribe and replicate their genomes. The proteins  performing these essential processes are prime antiviral drug targets, but drug  discovery is hindered by our incomplete understanding of coronavirus RNA  synthesis and processing. In infected cells, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase  must coordinate with other viral and host factors to produce both viral mRNAs and  new genomes. Recent research aiming to decipher and contextualize the structures,  functions and interplay of the subunits of the SARS-CoV-2 replication and  transcription complex proteins has burgeoned. In this Review, we discuss recent  advancements in our understanding of the molecular basis and complexity of the  coronavirus RNA-synthesizing machinery. Specifically, we outline the mechanisms  and regulation of RNA translation, replication and transcription. We also discuss  the composition of the replication and transcription complexes and their  suitability as targets for antiviral therapy.

AB  - SCOPE: In January 2021, the ESCMID Executive Committee decided to launch a new initiative to develop ESCMID guidelines on several COVID-19-related issues,  including treatment of COVID-19. METHODS: An ESCMID COVID-19 guidelines task  force was established by the ESCMID Executive Committee. A small group was  established, half appointed by the chair, and the remaining selected with an open  call. Each panel met virtually once a week. For all decisions, a simple majority  vote was used. A long list of clinical questions using the PICO (population,  intervention, comparison, outcome) format was developed at the beginning of the  process. For each PICO, two panel members performed a literature search with a  third panellist involved in case of inconsistent results. Voting was based on the  GRADE approach. QUESTIONS ADDRESSED BY THE GUIDELINE AND RECOMMENDATIONS: A  synthesis of the available evidence and recommendations is provided for each of  the 15 PICOs, which cover use of hydroxychloroquine, bamlanivimab alone or in  combination with etesevimab, casirivimab combined with imdevimab, ivermectin,  azithromycin and empirical antibiotics, colchicine, corticosteroids, convalescent  plasma, favipiravir, remdesivir, tocilizumab and interferon β-1a, as well as the  utility of antifungal prophylaxis and enoxaparin. In general, the panel  recommended against the use of hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, azithromycin,  colchicine and interferon β-1a. Conditional recommendations were given for the  use of monoclonal antibodies in high-risk outpatients with mild-moderate  COVID-19, and remdesivir. There was insufficient evidence to make a  recommendation for use of favipiravir and antifungal prophylaxis, and it was  recommended that antibiotics should not be routinely prescribed in patients with  COVID-19 unless bacterial coinfection or secondary infection is suspected or  confirmed. Tocilizumab and corticosteroids were recommended for treatment of  severe COVID-19 but not in outpatients with non-severe COVID-19. SCOPE: The aim  of the present guidance is to provide evidence-based recommendations for  management of adults with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). More specifically,  the goal is to aid clinicians managing patients with COVID-19 at various levels  of severity including outpatients, hospitalized patients, and those admitted to  intensive care unit. Considering the composition of the panel, mostly clinical  microbiologists or infectious disease specialists with no pulmonology or  intensive care background, we focus only on pharmacological treatment and do not  give recommendations on oxygen supplement/support. Similarly, as no  paediatricians were included in the panel; the recommendations are only for adult  patients with COVID-19. Considering the current literature, no guidance was given  for special populations such as the immunocompromised.

AB  - Sangivamycin is a nucleoside analog that is well tolerated by humans and broadly active against phylogenetically distinct viruses, including arenaviruses,  filoviruses, and orthopoxviruses. Here, we show that sangivamycin is a potent  antiviral against multiple variants of replicative severe acute respiratory  syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with half-maximal inhibitory concentration in  the nanomolar range in several cell types. Sangivamycin suppressed SARS-CoV-2  replication with greater efficacy than remdesivir (another broad-spectrum  nucleoside analog). When we investigated sangivamycin's potential for clinical  administration, pharmacokinetic; absorption, distribution, metabolism, and  excretion (ADME); and toxicity properties were found to be favorable. When tested  in combination with remdesivir, efficacy was additive rather than competitive  against SARS-CoV-2. The proven safety in humans, long half-life, potent antiviral  activity (compared to remdesivir), and combinatorial potential suggest that  sangivamycin is likely to be efficacious alone or in combination therapy to  suppress viremia in patients. Sangivamycin may also have the ability to help  combat drug-resistant or vaccine-escaping SARS-CoV-2 variants since it is  antivirally active against several tested variants. Our results support the  pursuit of sangivamycin for further preclinical and clinical development as a  potential coronavirus disease 2019 therapeutic.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Baricitinib-remdesivir (BARI-REM) combination is superior to remdesivir (REM) in reducing recovery time and accelerating clinical improvement  among hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),  specifically those receiving high-flow oxygen/noninvasive ventilation. Here we  assessed the cost-effectiveness of BARI-REM versus REM in hospitalized patients  with COVID-19 in the USA. METHODS: A three-state model was developed addressing  costs and patient utility associated with COVID-19 hospitalization, immediate  post hospital care, and subsequent lifetime medical care. Analysis was performed  from the perspective of a payer and a hospital. Both perspectives evaluated two  subgroups: all patients and patients who required oxygen. The primary measures of  benefit in the model were patient quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) accrued  during and after hospitalization, cost per life years gained, cost per death  avoided, and cost per use of mechanical ventilation avoided. RESULTS: In the  base-case payer perspective with a lifetime horizon, treatment with BARI-REM  versus REM resulted in an incremental total cost of $7962, a gain of 0.446 life  years and gain of 0.3565 QALYs over REM. The incremental cost-effectiveness  ratios of using BARI-REM were estimated as $22,334 per QALY and $17,858 per life  year. The base-case and sensitivity analyses showed that the total incremental  cost per QALY falls within the reduced willingness-to-pay threshold of  $50,000/QALY applied under health emergencies. In all hospitalized patients,  treatment with BARI-REM versus REM reduced total hospital expenditures per  patient by $1778 and total reimbursement payments by $1526, resulting in a $252  reduction in net costs per patient; it also resulted in a net gain of  0.0018 QALYs and increased survival of COVID-19 hospitalizations by 2.7%.  CONCLUSION: Our study showed that BARI-REM is cost-effective compared to using  REM for hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The base-case results of this  cost-effectiveness model were most sensitive to average annual medical costs for  recovered patients.

AB  - Amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it has become increasingly important to monitor the mutations that arise in the SARS-CoV-2 virus, to prepare public  health strategies and guide the further development of vaccines and therapeutics.  The spike (S) protein and the proteins comprising the RNA-Dependent RNA  Polymerase (RdRP) are key vaccine and drug targets, respectively, making mutation  surveillance of these proteins of great importance. Full protein sequences were  downloaded from the GISAID database, aligned, and the variants identified.  437,006 unique viral genomes were analyzed. Polymorphisms in the protein sequence  were investigated and examined longitudinally to identify sequence and strain  variants appearing between January 5th, 2020 and January 16th, 2021. A structural  analysis was also performed to investigate mutations in the receptor binding  domain and the N-terminal domain of the spike protein. Within the spike protein,  there were 766 unique mutations observed in the N-terminal domain and 360 in the  receptor binding domain. Four residues that directly contact ACE2 were mutated in  more than 100 sequences, including positions K417, Y453, S494, and N501. Within  the furin cleavage site of the spike protein, a high degree of conservation was  observed, but the P681H mutation was observed in 10.47% of sequences analyzed.  Within the RNA dependent RNA polymerase complex proteins, 327 unique mutations  were observed in Nsp8, 166 unique mutations were observed in Nsp7, and 1157  unique mutations were observed in Nsp12. Only 4 sequences analyzed contained  mutations in the 9 residues that directly interact with the therapeutic  Remdesivir, suggesting limited mutations in drug interacting residues. The  identification of new variants emphasizes the need for further study on the  effects of the mutations and the implications of increased prevalence,  particularly for vaccine or therapeutic efficacy.

AB  - PURPOSE: Racial disparities in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes have been described. We sought to determine whether differences in inflammatory  markers, use of COVID-19 therapies, enrollment in clinical trials, and  in-hospital outcomes contribute to racial disparities between Black and non-Black  patients hospitalized for COVID-19. METHODS: We leveraged a prospective cohort  study that enrolled 1325 consecutive patients hospitalized for COVID-19, of whom  341 (25.7%) were Black. We measured biomarkers of inflammation and collected data  on the use COVID-19-directed therapies, enrollment in COVID-19 clinical trials,  mortality, need for renal replacement therapy, and need for mechanical  ventilation. RESULTS: Compared to non-Black patients, Black patients had a higher  prevalence of COVID-19 risk factors including obesity, hypertension, and diabetes  mellitus and were more likely to require renal replacement therapy (15.8% vs  7.1%, P < .001) and mechanical ventilation (37.2% vs 26.6%, P < .001) during  their hospitalization. Mortality was similar between both groups (15.5% for  Blacks vs 14.0% for non-Blacks, P = .49). Black patients were less likely to  receive corticosteroids (44.9% vs 63.8%, P< .001) or remdesivir (23.8% vs 57.8%,  P < .001) and were less likely to be enrolled in COVID-19 clinical trials (15.3%  vs 28.2%, P < .001). In adjusted analyses, Black race was associated with lower  levels of C-reactive protein and soluble urokinase receptor and higher odds of  death, mechanical ventilation, and renal replacement therapy. Differences in  outcomes were not significant after adjusting for use of remdesivir and  corticosteroids. CONCLUSIONS: Racial differences in outcomes of patients with  COVID-19 may be related to differences in inflammatory response and differential  use of therapies.

AB  - Remdesivir, a prodrug of the nucleoside analog GS-441524, plays a key role in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, owing to limited  information on clinical trials and inexperienced clinical use, there is a lack of  pharmacokinetic (PK) data in patients with COVID-19 with special characteristics.  In this study, we aimed to measure serum GS-441524 concentrations and develop a  population PK (PopPK) model. Remdesivir was administered at a 200 mg loading dose  on the first day followed by 100 mg from day 2, based on the package insert, in  patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) greater than or  equal to 30 ml/min. In total, 190 concentrations from 37 Japanese patients were  used in the analysis. The GS-441524 trough concentrations were significantly  higher in the eGFR less than 60 ml/min group than in the eGFR greater than or  equal to 60 ml/min group. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in four patients  hardly affected the total body clearance (CL) and volume of distribution (V(d) )  of GS-441524. A one-compartment model described serum GS-441524 concentration  data. The CL and V(d) of GS-441524 were significantly affected by eGFR readjusted  by individual body surface area and age, respectively. Simulations proposed a  dose regimen of 200 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg once every 2 days from day 2  in patients with an eGFR of 30 ml/min or less. In conclusion, we successfully  established a PopPK model of GS-441524 using retrospectively obtained serum  GS-441524 concentrations in Japanese patients with COVID-19, which would be  helpful for optimal individualized therapy of remdesivir.

AB  - COVID-19, for which no confirmed therapeutic agents are available, has claimed over 48,14,000 lives globally. A feasible and quicker method to resolve this  problem may be 'drug repositioning'. We investigated selected FDA and WHO-EML  approved drugs based on their previously promising potential as antivirals,  antibacterials or antifungals. These drugs were docked onto the nsp12 protein,  which reigns the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity of SARS-CoV-2, a key  therapeutic target for coronaviruses. Docked complexes were reevaluated using  MM-GBSA analysis and the top three inhibitor-protein complexes were subjected to  100 ns long molecular dynamics simulation followed by another round of MM-GBSA  analysis. The RMSF plots, binding energies and the mode of physicochemical  interaction of the active site of the protein with the drugs were evaluated.  Suramin, Penciclovir, and Anidulafungin were found to bind to nsp12 with similar  binding energies as that of Remdesivir, which has been used as a therapy for  COVID-19. In addition, recent experimental evidences indicate that these drugs  exhibit antiviral efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. Such evidence, along with the  significant and varied physical interactions of these drugs with the key viral  enzyme outlined in this investigation, indicates that they might have a  prospective therapeutic potential in the treatment of COVID-19 as monotherapy or  combination therapy with Remdesivir.

AB  - By December 2019, humanity was challenged by a new infectious respiratory disease named coronavirus disease of 2019 or COVID-19. This is a viral infection based on  the presence of the previously non-problematic coronavirus with assigned number  2. This virus causes severe acute respiratory distress and is known now as  SARS-CoV2. Since SARS-CoV2 is an RNA virus, remdesivir and favipiravir, both  broad-spectrum RNA polymerase inhibitors, were repurposed for treating COVID-19  patients. Remdesivir and favipiravir are antimetabolites, and they are  structurally related to the naturally occurring structural elements of RNA. Both  agents are prodrugs and must be activated intracellularly to exert their effects  through numerous and different mechanisms of action. Efforts have been exerted to  determine their efficacy and safety against COVID-19 through clinical trials.  Clinical trials have shown an association of remdesivir with increased frequency  of adverse effects (in comparison to favipiravir). Nevertheless, the data  obtained with remdesivir resulted in its approval by the FDA on the 22(nd) of  October 2020 for COVID-19 treatment. At present, remdesivir is being recommended  by several treatment guidelines for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. The  evidence in favor of favipiravir is compromised by the small number and  low-quality of trials conducted. Favipiravir has shown various benefits when  administered in mild and moderate cases of COVID-19, while remdesivir was more  beneficial in more severe cases of the disease. Since the two agents are suitable  for different groups of patients, both drugs can play a significant role in  fighting this pandemic. The goal of this work is to summarize the information  available on two antimetabolites - remdesivir and favipiravir - and to compare  clinical experience obtained so far with these two agents in COVID-19 patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with some types of immunodeficiency can experience chronic or relapsing infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2  (SARS-CoV-2). This leads to morbidity and mortality, infection control  challenges, and the risk of evolution of novel viral variants. The optimal  treatment for chronic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is unknown. OBJECTIVE:  Our aim was to characterize a cohort of patients with chronic or relapsing  COVID-19 disease and record treatment response. METHODS: We conducted a UK  physician survey to collect data on underlying diagnosis and demographics,  clinical features, and treatment response of immunodeficient patients with  chronic (lasting ≥21 days) or relapsing (≥2 episodes) of COVID-19. RESULTS: We  identified 31 patients (median age 49 years). Their underlying immunodeficiency  was most commonly characterized by antibody deficiency with absent or profoundly  reduced peripheral B-cell levels; prior anti-CD20 therapy, and X-linked  agammaglobulinemia. Their clinical features of COVID-19 were similar to those of  the general population, but their median duration of symptomatic disease was 64  days (maximum 300 days) and individual patients experienced up to 5 episodes of  illness. Remdesivir monotherapy (including when given for prolonged courses of  ≤20 days) was associated with sustained viral clearance in 7 of 23 clinical  episodes (30.4%), whereas the combination of remdesivir with convalescent plasma  or anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs resulted in viral clearance in 13 of 14 episodes (92.8%).  Patients receiving no therapy did not clear SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 can  present as a chronic or relapsing disease in patients with antibody deficiency.  Remdesivir monotherapy is frequently associated with treatment failure, but the  combination of remdesivir with antibody-based therapeutics holds promise.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: There is limited data on the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in pregnancy. Arkansas saw an increase in COVID-19 cases in June 2020.  The first critically ill pregnant patient was admitted to our institution on May  21(st), 2020. The objective of this study was to evaluate outcomes in critically  ill pregnant women with COVID-19 at a single tertiary care center who received  remdesivir and convalescent plasma (CCP). STUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective  observational review of critically ill pregnant women with COVID-19 who received  remdesivir and CCP. This study was approved by the institutional review board  (#261354). RESULTS: Seven pregnant patients with COVID-19 were admitted to the  intensive care unit (ICU). All received remdesivir and CCP. Six received  dexamethasone. The median ICU length of stay (LOS) was 8 days (range 3-17).  Patient 1 had multi-organ failure requiring vasopressors, renal dialysis, and had  an intrauterine fetal demise. Patients 4 and 6 required mechanical ventilation,  were delivered for respiratory distress and were extubated at 2 and 1 days  postpartum, respectively. The only common risk factor was obesity. There were no  adverse events noted with remdesivir or CCP. CONCLUSION: There is little data  regarding the use of remdesivir or CCP for the treatment of COVID-19 in pregnant  women. In our cohort, these were well tolerated with no adverse events.  Previously reported median ICU LOS in critically ill pregnant women with COVID-19  was 8 days (range 4-15).1 Our study found a similar ICU LOS (8 days; range 3-17).  Patient 1 did not receive remdesivir or CCP until transport to our facility on  hospital day 3. Excluding patient 1, median ICU LOS was 6.5 days (range 3-9). Our  institution's treatment of pregnant women with critical illness with remdesivir,  CCP and dexamethasone combined with delivery in select cases has thus far had  good outcomes. KEY POINTS: · Combined therapy: remdesivir, CCP, dexamethasone.. ·  Remdesivir, CCP and dexamethasone was effective in treating critically ill  pregnant women with COVID-19.. · No adverse events were associated with combined  therapy.. · Delivery improved respiratory status..

AB  - The purpose of this survey is to explore changes in the management of COVID-19 during the first versus the second wave, with particular emphasis on therapies,  antibiotic prescriptions, and elderly care. An internet-based questionnaire  survey was distributed to European Society of Clinical Microbiology and  Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) members. Therapeutic approach to patients with  mild-to-moderate (PiO(2)/FiO(2) 200-350) and severe (PiO(2)/FiO(2) < 200)  COVID-19, antibiotic use, and reasons for excluding patients from the intensive  care unit (ICU) were investigated. A total of 463 from 21 countries participated  in the study. Most representatives were infectious disease specialists (68.3%).  During the second wave of pandemic, physicians abandoned the use of  hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and azithromycin in favor of  dexamethasone, low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH), and remdesivir in  mild-to-moderate COVID-19. In critically ill patients, we detected an increased  use of high-dose steroids (51%) and a decrease in tocilizumab use. The use of  antibiotics at hospital admission decreased but remained high in the second wave.  Age was reported to be a main consideration for exclusion of patients from ICU  care by 25% of responders; a third reported that elderly were not candidates for  ICU admission in their center. The decision to exclude patients from ICU care was  based on the individual decision of an intensivist in 59.6% of cases. The  approach of physicians to COVID-19 changed over time following evidence  accumulation and guidelines. Antibiotic use at hospital admission and decision to  exclude patients from ICU care remain critical aspects that should be better  investigated and harmonized among clinicians.

AB  - Remdesivir, an intravenous nucleotide prodrug, has been approved for treating COVID-19 in hospitalized adults and pediatric patients. Upon administration,  remdesivir can be readily hydrolyzed to form its active form GS-441524, while the  cleavage of the carboxylic ester into GS-704277 is the first step for remdesivir  activation. This study aims to assign the key enzymes responsible for remdesivir  hydrolysis in humans, as well as to investigate the kinetics of remdesivir  hydrolysis in various enzyme sources. The results showed that remdesivir could be  hydrolyzed to form GS-704277 in human plasma and the microsomes from human liver  (HLMs), lung (HLuMs) and kidney (HKMs), while the hydrolytic rate of remdesivir  in HLMs was the fastest. Chemical inhibition and reaction phenotyping assays  suggested that human carboxylesterase 1 (hCES1A) played a predominant role in  remdesivir hydrolysis, while cathepsin A (CTSA), acetylcholinesterase (AchE) and  butyrylcholinesterase (BchE) contributed to a lesser extent. Enzymatic kinetic  analyses demonstrated that remdesivir hydrolysis in hCES1A (SHUTCM) and HLMs  showed similar kinetic plots and much closed K(m) values to each other.  Meanwhile, GS-704277 formation rates were strongly correlated with the CES1A  activities in HLM samples from different individual donors. Further investigation  revealed that simvastatin (a therapeutic agent for adjuvant treating COVID-19)  strongly inhibited remdesivir hydrolysis in both recombinant hCES1A and HLMs.  Collectively, our findings reveal that hCES1A plays a predominant role in  remdesivir hydrolysis in humans, which are very helpful for predicting  inter-individual variability in response to remdesivir and for guiding the  rational use of this anti-COVID-19 agent in clinical settings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of the best combination between different antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs stills an interest in the treatment of COVID19  infection. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective randomized cohort study comprised  108 adult patients with confirmed PCR COVID 19 infection with systemic hyper  inflammation state, divided into two groups according to the treatment regimen,  56 in the tocilizumab- hydroxychloroquine (TCZ-HCQ) treatment, and 52 in the  tocilizumab-remdesivir (TCZ-RMV) treatment. The first group received a  combination of I.V. TCZ (400-800 mg every 24 h for only two doses) and HCQ (400  mg twice in the first day then 200 mg twice for 5 days) while the second group of  patients received I.V. RMV of 200 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg once daily  infused over 60 min for 5 days with the same TCZ regimen used in the first group.  All clinical parameters and laboratory investigations were assessed before and  after treatment. RESULTS: The CRP was significantly decreased while PaO(2)/FiO(2)  (P/F) ratio post-treatment was significantly improved in both treatment groups.  TCZ-HCQ group showed a significant decrease in the ferritin, LDH, and D. Dimer  levels. The median days of hospitalization with interquartile range (IQR) were 10  (6-16) and 8 (5-12) for TCZ-HCQ and TCZ-RMV groups, respectively. The numbers of  mechanically ventilated patients were 25 and 43 for TCZ-HCQ and TCZ-RMV groups,  respectively. Therapeutic failure was about 26.8% in the TCZ-HCQ group and 30.8%  in the TCZ-RMV group but there was no significant difference between both groups.  Some complications were recognized only in TCZ-RMV following treatment including  secondary bacterial infections (42.3%), myocarditis (15.4%), and finally  pulmonary embolism (7.7%). CONCLUSION: Efficacy of both TCZ-RMV and TCZ-HCQ  combinations are observed in the treatment of severe COVID-19 patients; however  the increased need for ICU or mechanical ventilation in the TCZ-RMV arm  contributed to the appearance of cardiac and thrombotic events. The study was  registered at the Clinical Trials registry (ClinicalTrials.gov; NCT04779047).

AB  - INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 is currently a global health issue and an important cause of mortality. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is one of the risk factors for  infection, morbidity and mortality by SARS-CoV-2. In our study, we aimed to  evaluate the clinical presentation and outcomes of CKD patients with COVID-19, as  well as identify predictors of mortality. METHODS: This was a retrospective study  of CKD patients admitted in a tertiary-care Portuguese hospital between March and  August of 2020. Variables were submitted to univariate and multivariate analysis  to determine factors predictive of in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: 130 CKD  patients were analyzed (median age 73.9 years, male 60.0%). Hypertension (81.5%),  cardiovascular disease (36.2%), and diabetes (54.6%) were frequent conditions.  Cough, dyspnea, fever and respiratory failure were also common. Almost 60% had  anemia, 50% hypoalbuminemia, 13.8% hyperlactacidemia and 17% acidemia. Mean serum  ferritin was 1531 µg/L, mean CRP 8.3 mg/dL and mean LDH 336.9 U/L. Most patients  were treated with lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine or corticosteroids and  only 2 with remdesivir. Eighty percent had acute kidney injury and 16.2% required  intensive care unit admission. The 34 patients who died were older and more  likely to have heart failure. They had higher neutrophils/lymphocytes ratio,  ferritin, lactate, and LDH levels. Multivariate analysis identified an  association between older age [OR 1.1 (CI 1.01-1.24), p=0.027], higher ferritin  [OR 1.0 (CI 1.00-1.00), p=0.009] and higher LDH levels [OR 1.0 (CI 1.00-1.01),  p=0.014] and mortality. CONCLUSION: In our cohort of CKD patients with COVID-19,  older age, higher ferritin, and higher LDH levels were independent risk factors  for mortality.

AB  - Remdesivir, an antiviral agent for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is metabolized intracellularly, with these metabolites eliminated  predominantly in urine. Because of a lack of safety and pharmacokinetic (PK)  data, remdesivir is not currently recommended for patients with estimated  glomerular filtration rate less than 30 ml/min/1.73 m(2) and those on  hemodialysis. This study evaluated the PKs of remdesivir and its metabolite,  GS-441524, in patients with COVID-19 who were and were not receiving renal  replacement therapy (RRT). This study enrolled two patients with normal renal  function, two with impaired renal function not receiving RRT, two receiving  continuous RRT (CRRT), and three undergoing intermittent hemodialysis (IHD).  Patients were administered 200 mg remdesivir on the first day, followed by  100 mg/day for 5-10 days. Serial blood samples were collected for PK analysis,  and PK parameters were assessed by a noncompartmental method. Systemic exposure  to remdesivir was higher in patients with impaired renal function and those  receiving CRRT than in patients with normal renal function, but was similar in  patients undergoing IHD and those with normal renal function. By contrast,  systemic exposure to GS-441524 was highest in patients undergoing IHD, followed  by patients with impaired renal function and those receiving CRRT, and lowest in  patients with normal renal function. The PK profiles of remdesivir and GS-441524  varied according to renal function and RRT. The impact of PK changes of  remdesivir and its metabolite on safety and efficacy should be considered when  administering remdesivir to patients with COVID-19 with renal impairment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with adverse outcomes in transplantation communities. Mucormycosis, although a rare infection,  has been classically linked to organ transplantation and is associated with  exceptionally high morbidity and mortality rates. In this pandemic era, the  double infection of mucormycosis and COVID-19 is a lethal combination but is  rarely described in the literature on organ transplantation. CASE PRESENTATION:  This article presents the case of a young kidney transplant recipient with  diabetes who acquired severe COVID-19, followed by disseminated mucormycosis. The  patient was a health care worker who developed severe COVID-19, for which he  received remdesivir, anticoagulation, and dexamethasone. No immunomodulatory  therapy was used. His maximum oxygen support was bilevel positive airway pressure  ventilation. His sugar levels were frequently deranged during the stay. He  developed secondary sepsis with Klebsiella, followed by nonhealing lung  consolidation. He later developed pleural effusion and splenic abscess, which was  detected incidentally. He underwent an emergency splenectomy, the culture of  which yielded mucormycosis. Liposomal amphotericin B 5 mg/kg was administered.  The patient deteriorated, and a repeat laparotomy yielded gastric perforation,  with pus culture showing mucormycosis. The patient died after a long hospital  stay. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis and management of this dual infection during the  pandemic is extremely challenging. In this case, the unusual location of  mucormycosis complicating COVID-19 calls for a meticulous approach to  opportunistic fungal infections in organ transplant recipients who are positive  for COVID-19, especially in those patients with diabetes.

AB  - The scientific community has been releasing whole genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 to facilitate the investigation of molecular features and evolutionary history.  We retrieved 36 genomes of 18 prevalent countries of Asia, Europe and America for  genomic diversity and mutational analysis. Besides, we studied mutations in the  RBD regions of Spike (S) proteins to analyze the drug efficiency against these  mutations. In this research, phylogenenetic analysis, evolutionary modeling,  substitution pattern analysis, molecular docking, dynamics simulation, etc. were  performed. The genomic sequences showed >99% similarity with the reference  sequence of China.TN93 + G was predicted as a best nucleotide substitution model.  It was revealed that effective transition from the co-existing SARS genome to the  SARS-CoV-2 and a noticeable positive selection in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes  occurred. Moreover, three mutations in RBD domain, Val/ Phe367, Val/ Leu 382 and  Ala/ Val522, were discovered in the genomes from Netherland, Bangladesh and the  USA, respectively. Molecular docking and dynamics study showed RBD with mutation  Val/Leu382 had the lowest binding affinity with remdesivir. In conclusion, the  SARS-CoV-2 genomes are similar, but multiple degrees of transitions and  transversions occurred. The mutations cause a significant conformational change,  which are needed to be investigated during drug and vaccine development.

AB  - As per the World Health Organization report, around 226 844 344 confirmed positive cases and 4 666 334 deaths are reported till September 17, 2021 due to  the recent viral outbreak. A novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome  coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) is responsible for the associated coronavirus disease  (COVID-19), which causes serious or even fatal respiratory tract infection and  yet no approved therapeutics or effective treatment is currently available to  combat the outbreak. Due to the emergency, the drug repurposing approach is being  explored for COVID-19. In this study, we attempt to understand the potential  mechanism and also the effect of the approved antiviral drugs against the  SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro). To understand the mechanism of inhibition of the  malaria drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) against SARS-CoV-2, we performed molecular  interaction studies. The studies revealed that HCQ docked at the active site of  the Human ACE2 receptor as a possible way of inhibition. Our in silico analysis  revealed that the three drugs Lopinavir, Ritonavir, and Remdesivir showed  interaction with the active site residues of Mpro. During molecular dynamics  simulation, based on the binding free energy contributions, Lopinavir showed  better results than Ritonavir and Remdesivir.

AB  - COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019), the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2) is an ongoing global public health  emergency. As understanding of the health effects of COVID-19 has improved,  companies and agencies worldwide have worked together to identify therapeutic  approaches, fast-track clinical trials and pathways for emergency use, and  approve therapies for patients. This work has resulted in therapies that not only  improve survival, reduce time of hospitalization, and time to recovery, but also  include preventative measures, such as vaccines. This manuscript discusses  development programs for 3 products that are approved or authorized for emergency  use at the time of writing: VEKLURY (remdesivir, direct-acting antiviral from  Gilead Sciences, Inc.), REGEN-COV (casirivimab and imdevimab antibody cocktail  from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc.), and Comirnaty (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19  Vaccine [Pfizer, Inc.-BioNTech]), and perspectives from the U.S. Food and Drug  Administration.

AB  - On October 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved remdesivir as the first drug for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),  increasing remdesivir prescriptions worldwide. However, potential cardiovascular  (CV) toxicities associated with remdesivir remain unknown. We aimed to  characterize the CV adverse drug reactions (ADRs) associated with remdesivir  using VigiBase, an individual case safety report database of the World Health  Organization (WHO). Disproportionality analyses of CV-ADRs associated with  remdesivir were performed using reported odds ratios and information components.  We conducted in vitro experiments using cardiomyocytes derived from human  pluripotent stem cell cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) to confirm cardiotoxicity of  remdesivir. To distinguish drug-induced CV-ADRs from COVID-19 effects, we  restricted analyses to patients with COVID-19 and found that, after adjusting for  multiple confounders, cardiac arrest (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.88, 95%  confidence interval [CI]: 1.08-3.29), bradycardia (aOR: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.24-3.53),  and hypotension (aOR: 1.67, 95% CI: 1.03-2.73) were associated with remdesivir.  In vitro data demonstrated that remdesivir reduced the cell viability of hPSC-CMs  in time- and dose-dependent manners. Physicians should be aware of potential CV  consequences following remdesivir use and implement adequate CV monitoring to  maintain a tolerable safety margin.

AB  - Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) as a global pandemic has attracted the attention of many scientific centers to find the right treatment. We expressed and purified the  recombinant receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein,  and specific RBD aptamers were designed using SELEX method. RNAi targeting  nucleocapsid phosphoprotein was synthesized and human lung cells were inoculated  with aptamer-functionalized lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) containing RNAi. The  results demonstrated that RBD aptamer having K(D) values of 0.290 nm possessed  good affinity. Based on molecular docking and efficacy prediction analysis, siRNA  molecule was showed the best action. LNPs were appropriately functionalized by  aptamer and contained RNAi molecules. Antiviral assay using q-PCR and ELISA  demonstrated that LNP functionalized with 35 µm Apt and containing 30 nm RNAi/ml  of cell culture had the best antiviral activity compared to other concentrations.  Applied aptamer in the nanocarrier has two important functions. First, it can  deliver the drug (RNAi) to the surface of epithelial cells. Second, by binding to  the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, it inhibits the virus entrance into cells. Our data  reveal an interaction between the aptamer and the virus, and RNAi targeted the  virus RNA. CT scan and the clinical laboratory tests in a clinical case study, a  36-year old man who presented with severe SARS-CoV-2, demonstrated that  inhalation of 10 mg Apt-LNPs-RNAi nebulized/day for six days resulted in an  improvement in consolidation and ground-glass opacity in lungs on the sixth day  of treatment. Our findings suggest the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection through  inhalation of Aptamer-LNPs-RNAi.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Interferons (IFNs) play a crucial role in antiviral immunity. Genetic defects in interferon receptors, IFNs, and auto-antibodies against IFNs can lead  to the development of life-threatening forms of infectious diseases like a severe  form of COVID-19. CASE PRESENTATION: A 13-year-old boy with a previously reported  homozygous loss-of-function mutation in interferon alpha/beta receptor subunit 1  (IFNAR1) (c.674-2A > G) was diagnosed with severe COVID-19. He had cold symptoms  and a high-grade fever at the time of admission. He was admitted to the pediatric  intensive care unit after showing no response to favipiravir and being hypoxemic.  High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scanning revealed lung involvement of  70% with extensive areas of consolidation in both lungs. Antibiotics, interferon  gamma (IFN-γ), remdesivir, methylprednisolone pulse, and other medications were  started in the patient. However, remdesivir and methylprednisolone pulse were  discontinued because of their adverse side effects in the patient. His general  condition improved, and a few days later was discharged from the hospital.  CONCLUSION: We reported a patient with severe COVID-19 who had a mutation in  IFNAR1. Our finding suggests that patients with IFNAR1 deficiency are prone to  severe forms of COVID-19. Besides, IFN-γ therapy may be a potential drug to treat  patients with defects in IFN-α/β signaling pathways which needs further  investigations.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The epidemiology and clinical manifestations of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are different in  children and adolescents compared with adults. Although coronavirus disease 2019  (COVID-19) appears to be less common in children, with milder disease overall,  severe complications may occur, including paediatric inflammatory multisystem  syndrome (PIMS-TS). Recognising the distinct needs of this population, the  National COVID-19 Clinical Evidence Taskforce formed a Paediatric and Adolescent  Care Panel to provide living guidelines for Australian clinicians to manage  children and adolescents with COVID-19 and COVID-19 complications. Living  guidelines mean that these evidence-based recommendations are updated in near  real time to give reliable, contemporaneous advice to Australian clinicians  providing paediatric care. MAIN RECOMMENDATIONS: To date, the Taskforce has made  20 specific recommendations for children and adolescents, including definitions  of disease severity, recommendations for therapy, respiratory support, and venous  thromboembolism prophylaxis for COVID-19 and for the management of PIMS-TS.  CHANGES IN MANAGEMENT AS A RESULT OF THE GUIDELINES: The Taskforce currently  recommends corticosteroids as first line treatment for acute COVID-19 in children  and adolescents who require oxygen. Tocilizumab could be considered, and  remdesivir should not be administered routinely in this population. Non-invasive  ventilation or high flow nasal cannulae should be considered in children and  adolescents with hypoxaemia or respiratory distress unresponsive to low flow  oxygen if appropriate infection control measures can be used. Children and  adolescents with PIMS-TS should be managed by a multidisciplinary team.  Intravenous immunoglobulin and corticosteroids, with concomitant aspirin and  thromboprophylaxis, should be considered for the treatment of PIMS-TS. The latest  updates and full recommendations are available at www.covid19evidence.net.au.

AB  - The novel Coronavirus outbreak has created a massive economic crisis, and many succumb to death, disturbing the lives of mankind all over the world. Currently,  there are no viable treatment for this condition, drug development approaches are  being pursued with vigor. The major treatment options are to repurpose existing  drugs or to find new ones. Traditional methods for drug discovery take a longer  time, so there is an urgent need to develop some alternative techniques that  reduces search space for drug candidates. Towards this endeavor, we propose a  novel drug discovery method that leverages on long short term memory (LSTM) model  to generate novel molecules that are adept at binding with novel Coronavirus  protease. Our study demonstrates that the proposed method is able to recreate  novel molecules that correlate very much with the properties of trained  molecules. Further, we fine-tune the model to generate novel drug-like molecules  that are active towards a specific target. We consider 3CLPro, the main protease  of novel Coronavirus, as a therapeutic target and demonstrated in silico  screening to assess target structural binding affinities with docking  simulations. We observed that 80% of generated molecules show docking free energy  of less than -5.8 kcal/mol. The top generated drug candidate has the highest  binding affinity with a docking score of -8.5 kcal/mol, which is very much lower  when compared to approved existing commercial drugs including, Remdesivir. The  low binding energy indicates that the generated molecules could be explored as  potential drug candidates for Covid-19.

AB  - A massive vaccination campaign against the global COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus began worldwide in January 2021. However, studies continue to  investigate the most effective and safe drug therapies to manage the various  stages of viral infection. It is critical in the therapeutic management of the  patient, with ongoing COVID-19 infection, to reduce viral load and replication,  and to regulate the generalized hyperinflammatory state caused by the cytokine  storm that occurs in the most severe phases. Probably the right drug therapy is  represented by the use of different drugs acting in different modalities and on  different targets, to avoid also viral drug resistance. In this article, we  describe an interesting scientific pharmacological hypothesis arising from the  evidence in the literature; we believe that the association of  baricitinib/remdesivir/rhACE2, administered at the right time and dose,  represents an important pharmacological synergism that can be therapeutically  more effective for the treatment of COVID-19 infection than the single  administration of drugs and avoid the phenomenon of drug resistance caused by the  virus.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study investigated adults hospitalized with COVID-19 and  hypothesized that risk factors for AKI would include comorbidities and non-White  race. METHODS: A prospective multicentre cohort study was performed using  patients admitted to 254 UK hospitals with COVID-19 between 17 January 2020 and 5  December 2020. RESULTS: Of 85 687 patients, 2198 (2.6%) received acute kidney  replacement therapy (KRT). Of 41 294 patients with biochemistry data, 13 000  (31.5%) had biochemical AKI: 8562 stage 1 (65.9%), 2609 stage 2 (20.1%) and 1829  stage 3 (14.1%). The main risk factors for KRT were chronic kidney disease (CKD)  [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 3.41: 95% confidence interval 3.06-3.81], male sex  (aOR 2.43: 2.18-2.71) and Black race (aOR 2.17: 1.79-2.63). The main risk factors  for biochemical AKI were admission respiratory rate >30 breaths per minute (aOR  1.68: 1.56-1.81), CKD (aOR 1.66: 1.57-1.76) and Black race (aOR 1.44: 1.28-1.61).  There was a gradated rise in the risk of 28-day mortality by increasing severity  of AKI: stage 1 aOR 1.58 (1.49-1.67), stage 2 aOR 2.41 (2.20-2.64), stage 3 aOR  3.50 (3.14-3.91) and KRT aOR 3.06 (2.75-3.39). AKI rates peaked in April 2020 and  the subsequent fall in rates could not be explained by the use of dexamethasone  or remdesivir. CONCLUSIONS: AKI is common in adults hospitalized with COVID-19  and it is associated with a heightened risk of mortality. Although the rates of  AKI have fallen from the early months of the pandemic, high-risk patients should  have their kidney function and fluid status monitored closely.

AB  - Remdesivir (RDV) is the first drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in  certain patients requiring hospitalization. As a nucleoside analogue prodrug, RDV  undergoes intracellular multistep activation to form its pharmacologically active  species, GS-443902, which is not detectable in the plasma. A question arises that  whether the observed plasma exposure of RDV and its metabolites would correlate  with or be informative about the exposure of GS-443902 in tissues. A whole body  physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling and simulation approach was  utilized to elucidate the disposition mechanism of RDV and its metabolites in the  lungs and liver and explore the relationship between plasma and tissue  pharmacokinetics (PK) of RDV and its metabolites in healthy subjects. In  addition, the potential alteration of plasma and tissue PK of RDV and its  metabolites in patients with organ dysfunction was explored. Our simulation  results indicated that intracellular exposure of GS-443902 was decreased in the  liver and increased in the lungs in subjects with hepatic impairment relative to  the subjects with normal liver function. In subjects with severe renal  impairment, the exposure of GS-443902 in the liver was slightly increased,  whereas the lung exposure of GS-443902 was not impacted. These predictions along  with the organ impairment study results may be used to support decision making  regarding the RDV dosage adjustment in these patient subgroups. The modeling  exercise illustrated the potential of whole body PBPK modeling to aid in decision  making for nucleotide analogue prodrugs, particularly when the active metabolite  exposure in the target tissues is not available.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Combination therapy with dexamethasone, remdesivir, and baricitinib has become a promising treatment for moderate or severe COVID-19; however, we  have observed transient leukocytopenia in COVID-19 patients who received  combination therapy. METHODS: Twelve consecutive COVID-19 patients treated with  combination therapy were included in this retrospective analysis. Blood cell  counts collected at the following three time points were analyzed: before the  start of therapy (period 1), within 24 h of starting therapy (period 2), and  within 48 h of period 2 (period 3). RESULTS: The leukocyte count significantly  decreased in period 2 compared to period 1 and then significantly increased in  period 3 without withdrawal of baricitinib. The neutrophil count transiently  decreased in period 2 and recovered in period 3. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should  be aware of transient leukocytopenia in patients with COVID-19 during the early  phase of combination therapy.

AB  - We aimed to create the prediction model of in-hospital mortality using machine learning methods for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) treated  with steroid and remdesivir. We reviewed 1571 hospitalized patients with  laboratory confirmed COVID-19 from the Mount Sinai Health System treated with  both steroids and remdesivir. The important variables associated with in-hospital  mortality were identified using LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection  operator) and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) through the light gradient  boosting model (GBM). The data before February 17th, 2021 (N = 769) was randomly  split into training and testing datasets; 80% versus 20%, respectively. Light GBM  models were created with train data and area under the curves (AUCs) were  calculated. Additionally, we calculated AUC with the data between February 17th,  2021 and March 30th, 2021 (N = 802). Of the 1571 patients admitted due to  COVID-19, 331 (21.1%) died during hospitalization. Through LASSO and SHAP, we  selected six important variables; age, hypertension, oxygen saturation, blood  urea nitrogen, intensive care unit admission, and endotracheal intubation. AUCs  using training and testing datasets derived from the data before February 17th,  2021 were 0.871/0.911. Additionally, the light GBM model has high predictability  for the latest data (AUC: 0.881) (https://risk-model.herokuapp.com/covid). A  high-value prediction model was created to estimate in-hospital mortality for  COVID-19 patients treated with steroid and remdesivir.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) results predominantly in pulmonary involvement but a direct, virus-induced liver damage may also occur, whose mechanisms are  being actively investigated. Accordingly, it appears of utmost importance to  monitor liver function and carefully evaluate hepatic safety of the various drugs  administered during COVID-19. In this respect, many drugs, biological agents and  novel molecules, whose efficacy in COVID-19 is under scrutiny, have also been  shown to potentially cause or worsen liver damage. In this article, we review  safety data of established as well as promising agents for COVID-19.

AU  - Nabati, Maryam

T2  - Cardiovascular toxicology
AB  - Corona disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to spread around the world with no efficacious treatment. Intravenous remdesivir is the only authorized drug for  treatment of COVID-19 disease under an Emergency Use Authorization. Remdesivir is  a 1'-cyano-substituted adenosine nucleotide prodrug which inhibits viral RNA  synthesis. This metabolite is an adenosine analog but with a significantly longer  half-life than adenosine. Adenosine is a powerful vasodilator that can cause  profound hypotension which is followed by the compensatory release of  catecholamines. It can also shorten atrial action potential and refractoriness  and lead to atrial fibrillation (AF). These effects may also occur in ventricular  cells and predispose patients to ventricular fibrillation. Remdesivir can also  induce significant cytotoxic effects in cardiomyocytes that is considerably worse  than chloroquine cardiotoxic effects. Remdesivir-induced cardiotoxicity is due to  its binding to human mitochondrial RNA polymerase. On the other hand, remdesivir  can increase field potential duration with decreased Na(+) peak amplitudes and  spontaneous beating rates in a dose-dependent manner that might induce prolonged  QT interval and torsade de point. There are some reports of sinus bradycardia,  hypotension, T-wave abnormalities, AF, and a prolonged QT interval and few cases  of cardiac arrest and complete heat block following remdesivir infusion. It seems  remdesivir have some cardiotoxic and proarrhythmic effects that are especially  more pronounced in patients with previous cardiovascular diseases. The current  safety profile of remdesivir is still not completely known and further  prospective clinical trials are needed to assess its safety profile and potential  adverse cardiovascular effects.

AB  - The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is one of the crucial enzymes in severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) catalysing the replication  of RNA, therefore acts as a potential target for antiviral drug design. The  fixation of a ligand in the active site of RdRp may alter the SARS-CoV-2 life  cycle. Present work aimed at identifying novel inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp  enzyme by performing pharmacophore-based virtual screening, molecular docking and  molecular dynamics simulation (MDS). Initially, the pharmacophore model of  SARS-CoV-2 RdRp was constructed and the resulting model was used to screen  compounds from ChEMBL, ZINC and PubChem databases. During the investigation, 180  compounds were screened using the above model and subjected to molecular docking  with RdRp. Two compounds viz. ChEMBL1276156 and PubChem135548348 showed a strong  binding affinity with RdRp than its standard inhibitor, Remdesivir. Toxicity  prediction of these two compounds reveals their non-toxic nature. These compounds  were further subjected to MDS for 100 ns to check their stability after binding  with RdRp. The MDS of RdRp-ChEMBL1276156 and RdRp-PubChem135548348 complexes show  enhanced stability in comparison to the RdRp-Remdesivir complex. The average  interaction energy calculated after 100 ns of MDS was -146.56 and -172.68 KJ  mol(-1) for RdRp-CHEMBL1276156 complex and RdRp-PubChem135548348 complex,  respectively, while -59.90 KJ mol(-1) for RdRp-Remdesivir complex. The current  investigation reveals that these two compounds are potent inhibitors of  SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and they could be tested in the experimental condition to  evaluate their efficacy against SARS-CoV-2.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

AB  - Viral infections are particularly common among children. They often have a mild course, are self-limiting and do not need any specific treatment. However, in  some cases, the disease can be severe and lead to permanent disabilities. A  variety of antiviral drugs are available for the treatments of certain infectious  agents: for instance, acyclovir is used to treat herpes simplex virus  encephalitis. Recommendations for flu treatment may change according to the  current epidemiological surveillance data, on the basis of which antiviral  sensibility can be forecast: recommended drugs for the 2020-21 flu season are  oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir and baloxavir. Some drugs are used to treat  congenital infections, such as valganciclovir and ganciclovir in congenital  cytomegalovirus infection. Antiretroviral prophylaxis in newborns from HIV-1  infected mothers must be initiated as soon as possible, with one or more drugs  according to therapeutic regimens based on the baby's risk category. According to  the most recent guidelines, antiretroviral therapy must be started at diagnosis.  Several antiretroviral drugs are available today and approved for use in  children, so several combinations can be made. However, out of the 29  antiretroviral drugs approved for adults, only 38% (11/29) are approved for  children under the age of two and about 60% (18/29) for children under the age of  twelve. Treatment with direct antiviral agents against hepatitis C virus is  approved for children over the age of three; it consists in different therapeutic  regimens chosen on the basis of the viral genotype (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for  genotypes 1, 4, 5 and 6, sofosbuvir/ribavirin for genotypes 2 and 3,  sofosbuvir/velpatasvir and glecaprevir/pibrentasvir for all genotypes) and it has  dramatically changed the course of the illness. Many molecules have been studied  in order to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection, but only remdesivir seems to play a role  in shortening recovery time, although inclusion criteria are very specific and  data on the use in children is limited.

AB  - In this study, we propose our novel benzophenone-coumarin derivatives (BCDs) as potent inhibitors of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2 virus,  one of the key targets that are involved in the viral genome replication. We aim  to evaluate the in silico antiviral potential of BCDs against this protein  target, which involves molecular docking simulations, druglikeliness and  pharmacokinetic evaluations, PASS analysis, molecular dynamics simulations, and  computing binding free energy. Out of all the BCDs screened through these  parameters, BCD-8 was found to be the most efficient and potent inhibitor of  SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. During molecular docking simulation, BCD-8 showed an extensive  molecular interaction in comparison with that of the standard control used,  remdesivir. The druglikeliness and pharmacokinetic analyses also proved the  efficiency of BCD-8 as an effective drug without adverse effects. Further,  pharmacological potential analysis through PASS depicted the antiviral property  of BCD-8. With these findings, we performed molecular dynamics simulations, where  BCD-8 edged out remdesivir with its exemplary stable interaction with SARS-CoV-2  RdRp. Furthermore, binding free energy of both BCD-8 and remdesivir was  calculated, where BCD-8 showed a lower binding energy and standard deviations in  comparison with that of remdesivir. Moreover, being a non-nucleoside analogue,  BCD-8 can be used effectively against SARS-CoV-2, whereas nucleoside analogues  like remdesivir may become non-functional or less functional due to exonuclease  activity of nsp14 of the virus. Therefore, we propose BCD-8 as a SARS-CoV-2 RdRp  inhibitor, showing higher predicted efficiency than remdesivir in all the in  silico experiments conducted.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

Both cases had moderate to severe pneumonia treated  with intravenous dexamethasone or in the severe case remdesivir in addition to  it. These cases suggest that the use of CNI may have affected the improvement of  severe pneumonia.

AB  - The catastrophic phase of Covid-19 turns the table over with the spread of its disastrous transmission network throughout the world. Covid-19 associated with  mucormycosis fungal infection accompanied by opportunistic comorbidities have  emerged the myriad of complications and manifestations. We searched the  electronic databases of Google Scholar, PubMed, Springer, and Elsevier until June  05, 2021, using keywords. We retrieved the details of confirmed and suspected  mucormycosis patients associated with Covid-19. We analyzed the case reports,  treatment given for Covid-19, steroids used, associated comorbidities,  mucormycosis site involved, and patients survived or dead. Overall, 102 patients  of mucormycosis associated with Covid-19 have been reported from India.  Mucormycosis was predominant in males (69.6%) rather than females (19.6%), and  most of the patients were active Covid-19 cases (70.5%). Steroids were mostly  used (68.6%) for the treatment of Covid-19 followed by remdesivir (10.7%).  Patients were suffering from diabetes mellitus (88.2%) and severe diabetic  ketoacidosis (11.7%). Mucormycosis affects the sino-nasal (72.5%), orbit (24.5%),  central nervous system (18.6%), and maxillary necrosis (13.7%) of the patients.  The Mortality rate was recorded as 23.5%, and recovery rate was 2.9%. Diabetes  mellitus cases are highest in India as compared to other countries, and prevalent  use of steroids with the background of Covid-19 becomes an opportunistic  environment for mucormycosis fungal infection to survive.

AB  - The spread of corona-virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been faster than any other corona-viruses that have succeeded in crossing the animal-human barrier. This  disease, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona-virus 2  (SARS-CoV-2/2019-nCoV) posing a serious threat to global public health and local  economies. There are three responsible for this disease; SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and  MERS-CoV. Whereas our goal is to test the affinity for a new class of compounds  obtained from a hybridization of Chloroquine, Amodiaquine and Mefloquine with  three targets SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, in order to find new compounds  as new inhibitors against Covid-19. In this work, we first used: the molecular  docking/dynamics methods and ADME properties to study interaction and affinity  between eight new compounds against three targets involved in the Covid-19. The  results of the docking simulations and dynamics revealed that inhibitor of the  malaria (Ligand 87) has an affinity to interact with SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and  MERS-CoV targets and they can be good inhibitors for treatment of Covid-19.  Moreover, they give best affinity compared to the Remdesivir and Chloroquine and  other clinical tests. The Pharmacokinetics was justified by means of  lipophilicity and high coefficient of skin permeability. The in silico evaluation  of ADME and drug-likeness revealed that L87 has higher absorption in the  intestines with good bioavailability. However, an additional in vitro and/or in  vivo experimental study should make it possible to verify the theoretical results  obtained in silico.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

AB  - The proverb "Old is gold" is applicable in drug discovery and the proverb "All that Glitters is not Gold" is also appropriate. In the COVID-19 era, there has  been a race for drugs to be effective against SARS-CoV-2. There are reports about  the uses of Remdesivir and Favipiravir as existing antivirals against virus but  none have been conclusive so far. In the attempts for innovations, the  combination of drugs is also under trials. Therefore, we used the density  functional theory method and quantum theory of atoms in molecules to investigate  drug-drug interactions involving Remdesivir and Favipiravir. The computed  parameters were related to the antiviral actions of both drugs together. The  results indicate enhanced antiviral activity and it will be worthy to consider  additional investigations with the combination of these two drugs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The antiviral efficacy of remdesivir against SARS-CoV-2 is still controversial. We aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of remdesivir plus  standard of care compared with standard of care alone in patients admitted to  hospital with COVID-19, with indication of oxygen or ventilator support. METHODS:  DisCoVeRy was a phase 3, open-label, adaptive, multicentre, randomised,  controlled trial conducted in 48 sites in Europe (France, Belgium, Austria,  Portugal, Luxembourg). Adult patients (aged ≥18 years) admitted to hospital with  laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and illness of any duration were  eligible if they had clinical evidence of hypoxaemic pneumonia, or required  oxygen supplementation. Exclusion criteria included elevated liver enzymes,  severe chronic kidney disease, any contraindication to one of the studied  treatments or their use in the 29 days before random assignment, or use of  ribavirin, as well as pregnancy or breastfeeding. Participants were randomly  assigned (1:1:1:1:1) to receive standard of care alone or in combination with  remdesivir, lopinavir-ritonavir, lopinavir-ritonavir and interferon beta-1a, or  hydroxychloroquine. Randomisation used computer-generated blocks of various  sizes; it was stratified on severity of disease at inclusion and on European  administrative region. Remdesivir was administered as 200 mg intravenous infusion  on day 1, followed by once daily, 1-h infusions of 100 mg up to 9 days, for a  total duration of 10 days. It could be stopped after 5 days if the participant  was discharged. The primary outcome was the clinical status at day 15 measured by  the WHO seven-point ordinal scale, assessed in the intention-to-treat population.  Safety was assessed in the modified intention-to-treat population and was one of  the secondary outcomes. This trial is registered with the European Clinical  Trials Database, EudraCT2020-000936-23, and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04315948.  FINDINGS: Between March 22, 2020, and Jan 21, 2021, 857 participants were  enrolled and randomly assigned to remdesivir plus standard of care (n=429) or  standard of care only (n=428). 15 participants were excluded from analysis in the  remdesivir group, and ten in the control group. At day 15, the distribution of  the WHO ordinal scale was: (1) not hospitalised, no limitations on activities (61  [15%] of 414 in the remdesivir group vs 73 [17%] of 418 in the control group);  (2) not hospitalised, limitation on activities (129 [31%] vs 132 [32%]); (3)  hospitalised, not requiring supplemental oxygen (50 [12%] vs 29 [7%]); (4)  hospitalised, requiring supplemental oxygen (76 [18%] vs 67 [16%]); (5)  hospitalised, on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices (15 [4%] vs  14 [3%]); (6) hospitalised, on invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal  membrane oxygenation (62 [15%] vs 79 [19%]); (7) death (21 [5%] vs 24 [6%]). The  difference between treatment groups was not significant (odds ratio 0·98 [95% CI  0·77-1·25]; p=0·85). There was no significant difference in the occurrence of  serious adverse events between treatment groups (remdesivir, 135 [33%] of 406 vs  control, 130 [31%] of 418; p=0·48). Three deaths (acute respiratory distress  syndrome, bacterial infection, and hepatorenal syndrome) were considered related  to remdesivir by the investigators, but only one by the sponsor's safety team  (hepatorenal syndrome). INTERPRETATION: No clinical benefit was observed from the  use of remdesivir in patients who were admitted to hospital for COVID-19, were  symptomatic for more than 7 days, and required oxygen support.

AB  - Stem and bark of the tree Terminalia arjuna Wight & Arn. (Combretaceae) has been documented to exhibit therapeutic properties like cardiotonic, anticancer,  antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, hypercholesterolemia, hypolipidemic, and  anti-coagulant. Our previous studies have shown that, ethanolic extract of T.  arjuna bark exhibits radical scavenging anti-oxidant activity and also  effectively inhibited catalase activity. In this study, oleanane triterpenoids  type compounds viz., oleanolic acid, arjunolic acid, arjunolitin, arjunetin were  isolated from ethanolic bark extract as bio-active compound and their structures  were elucidated using (1)H, (13)C NMR, HR-ESIMS, IR. Of the various compounds,  Arjunetin showed significant inhibition of catalase activity as compared to the  other compounds. Based on the structural similarity between arjunetin and current  antiviral drugs, we propose that arjunetin might exhibit antiviral activity.  Molecular docking and molecular dynamics studies showed that arjunetin binds to  the binds to key targets of SARS-CoV-2 namely, 3CLpro, PLpro, and RdRp) with a  higher binding energy values (3CLpro, -8.4 kcal/mol; PLpro, -7.6 kcal/mol and  RdRp, -8.1 kcal/mol) as compared with FDA approved protease inhibitor drugs to  Lopinavir (3CLpro, -7.2 kcal/mole and PLpro -7.7 kcal/mole) and Remdesivir (RdRp  -7.6 kcal/mole). To further investigate this, we performed 200-500 ns molecular  dynamics simulation studies. The results transpired that the binding affinity of  Arjunetin is higher than Remdesivir in the RNA binding cavity of RdRp. Based on  structural similarity between arjunetin and Saikosaponin (a known antiviral  agents) and based on our molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation  studies, we propose that arjunetin can be a promising drug candidate against  Covid-19.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

AB  - Many treatments including antiviral and non-antiviral drugs, and critical care are considered for the management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).  Practice recommendations need to be updated and graded according to the critical  evaluation of rapidly emerging literature. In June 2020, Research Center for  Epidemic Prevention-National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University formed a task group  comprising infectious disease clinicians, pulmonologists, and intensivists with  varied areas of expertise. The steering committee prioritized questions and  outcomes. The keywords for the searches were COVID-19 and prone position,  extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), noninvasive positive pressure  ventilation (NIPPV), remdesivir, lopinavir, hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine  (HCQ/CQ), azithromycin, corticosteroid, tocilizumab, convalescent plasma therapy,  and intravenous immunoglobin (IVIG). A systematic review of peer-reviewed  literature was performed by the consensus panel. The Grading of Recommendations  Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used in assessing the  certainty of evidence and making recommendations. The effects of COVID-19  treatments on mortality and clinical improvement were summarized in 11 tables,  and GRADE was presented to define the strength and quality of evidence for  recommendation. The consensus recommended that prone position implanted in  COVID-19 patients with hypoxic respiratory failure (IIC), careful selection for  the support of ECMO (IIB), NIPPV being feasible but a risk of staff contamination  (IIC), remdesivir generally administered in mild-to-moderate COVID-19 patients  (IA), the use of dexamethasone in critically ill COVID-19 patients (IA), and the  use of tociliziumab in hospitalized severe/critical COVID-19 patient with  elevated markers of systemic inflammation (IA). The consensus recommended against  the use of lopinavir/ritonavir (IB), HCQ/CQ (IA), azithromycin (IA), convalescent  plasma therapy (IA), and IVIG (IA). The inception of the consensus and task group  has provided much-needed evidence of the efficacy and safety of various therapies  for the management of COVID-19 patients, and make a description about the  benefits and harms for most treatments.

AB  - Mortality among patients hospitalized for COVID-19 has declined over the course of the pandemic. Mortality trends specifically in solid organ transplant  recipients (SOTR) are unknown. Using data from a multicenter registry of SOTR  hospitalized for COVID-19, we compared 28-day mortality between early 2020 (March  1, 2020-June 19, 2020) and late 2020 (June 20, 2020-December 31, 2020).  Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess comorbidity-adjusted  mortality. Time period of diagnosis was available for 1435/1616 (88.8%) SOTR and  971/1435 (67.7%) were hospitalized: 571/753 (75.8%) in early 2020 and 402/682  (58.9%) in late 2020 (p < .001). Crude 28-day mortality decreased between the  early and late periods (112/571 [19.6%] vs. 55/402 [13.7%]) and remained lower in  the late period even after adjusting for baseline comorbidities (aOR 0.67, 95% CI  0.46-0.98, p = .016). Between the early and late periods, the use of  corticosteroids (≥6 mg dexamethasone/day) and remdesivir increased (62/571  [10.9%] vs. 243/402 [61.5%], p < .001 and 50/571 [8.8%] vs. 213/402 [52.2%],  p < .001, respectively), and the use of hydroxychloroquine and IL-6/IL-6 receptor  inhibitor decreased (329/571 [60.0%] vs. 4/492 [1.0%], p < .001 and 73/571  [12.8%] vs. 5/402 [1.2%], p < .001, respectively). Mortality among SOTR  hospitalized for COVID-19 declined between early and late 2020, consistent with  trends reported in the general population. The mechanism(s) underlying improved  survival require further study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has generated significant debate about how emerging infections can be treated in the absence of evidence-based therapies to  combat disease. In particular, the use of off-label therapies outside of a  clinical trial setting has been controversial. AIM: To longitudinally study  policies and prescribing practices pertaining to therapies for COVID-19 in  Australian health services during 2020. METHODS: Prospective data were collected  from participating Australian health services who may care for patients with  COVID-19 via an electronic portal. A single informant from each health service  was emailed a survey link at regular intervals. Information was sought regarding  changes to COVID-19 policy at their service and use of therapies for COVID-19.  RESULTS: Overall, 78 hospitals were represented from 39 respondents with  longitudinal data collection from May to December 2020. All Australian  states/territories were represented with the majority (34/39; 87%) of respondents  located in a major city. Just over half (20/39) of respondents had a written  policy for COVID-19 therapy use at their health service at survey enrolment and  policies changed frequently throughout the pandemic. Therapy use outside of a  clinical trial was reported in 54% of health services, most frequently in  Victoria, correlating with higher numbers of COVID-19 cases. At study  commencement, hydroxychloroquine was most frequently used, with corticosteroids  and remdesivir use increasingly throughout the study period. CONCLUSION: Our  results reflect the reactive nature of prescribing of therapies for COVID-19 and  highlight the importance of evidence-based guidelines to assist prescribers.

AB  - The pandemic, caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV- 2), is responsible for multiple worldwide lockdowns, an economic crisis, and a  substantial increase in hospitalizations for viral pneumonia along with  respiratory failure and multiorgan dysfunctions. Recently, the first few vaccines  were approved by World Health Organization (WHO) and can eventually save millions  of lives. Even though, few drugs are used in emergency like Remdesivir and  several other repurposed drugs, still there is no approved drug for COVID-19. The  coronaviral encoded proteins involved in host-cell entry, replication, and  host-cell invading mechanism are potential therapeutic targets. This perspective  review provides the molecular overview of SARS-CoV-2 life cycle for summarizing  potential drug targets, structural insights, active site contour map analyses of  those selected SARS-CoV-2 protein targets for drug discovery, immunology, and  pathogenesis.

AB  - The epidemic of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) that started in 2019 has evoked an urgent demand for finding new potential therapeutic agents. In this  study, we performed a molecular docking of anti-HIV drugs to refine HIV protease  inhibitors and nucleotide analogues to target COVID-19. The evaluation was based  on docking scores calculated by AutoDock Vina and top binding poses were  analyzed. Our results suggested that lopinavir, darunavir, atazanavir,  remdesivir, and tipranavir have the best binding affinity for the  3-chymotrypsin-like protease of COVID-19. The comparison of the binding sites of  three drugs, namely, darunavir, atazanavir and remdesivir, showed an overlap  region of the protein pocket. Our study showed a strong affinity between  lopinavir, darunavir, atazanavir, tipranavir and COVID-19 protease. However,  their efficacy should be confirmed by in vitro studies since there are concerns  related to interference with their active sites.

AB  - With the gradual increase in the COVID-19 mortality rate, there is an urgent need for an effective drug/vaccine. Several drugs like Remdesivir, Azithromycin,  Favirapir, Ritonavir, Darunavir, etc., are put under evaluation in more than 300  clinical trials to treat COVID-19. On the other hand, several vaccines like  Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson's Janssen, Sputnik V, Covishield,  Covaxin, etc., also evolved from the research study. While few of them already  gets approved, others show encouraging results and are still under assessment. In  parallel, there are also significant developments in new drug development. But,  since the approval of new molecules takes substantial time, drug repurposing  studies have also gained considerable momentum. The primary agent of the disease  progression of COVID-19 is SARS-CoV2/nCoV, which is believed to have ~89% genetic  resemblance with SARS-CoV, a coronavirus responsible for the massive outbreak in  2003. With this hypothesis, Human-SARS-CoV protein interactions are used to  develop an in-silico Human-nCoV network by identifying potential COVID-19 human  spreader proteins by applying the SIS model and fuzzy thresholding by a possible  COVID-19 FDA drugs target-based validation. At first, the complete list of FDA  drugs is identified for the level-1 and level-2 spreader proteins in this  network, followed by applying a drug consensus scoring strategy. The same  consensus strategy is involved in the second analysis but on a curated  overlapping set of key genes/proteins identified from COVID-19 symptoms.  Validation using subsequent docking study has also been performed on COVID-19  potential drugs with the available major COVID-19 crystal structures whose PDB  IDs are: 6LU7, 6M2Q, 6W9C, 6M0J, 6M71 and 6VXX. Our computational study and  docking results suggest that Fostamatinib (R406 as its active promoiety) may also  be considered as one of the potential candidates for further clinical trials in  pursuit to counter the spread of COVID-19.

AB  - Detailed information on intrahost viral evolution in SARS-CoV-2 with and without treatment is limited. Sequential viral loads and deep sequencing of SARS-CoV-2  from the upper respiratory tract of nine hospitalized children, three of whom  were treated with remdesivir, revealed that remdesivir treatment suppressed viral  load in one patient but not in a second infected with an identical strain without  any evidence of drug resistance found. Reduced levels of subgenomic RNA during  treatment of the second patient, suggest an additional effect of remdesivir on  viral replication. Haplotype reconstruction uncovered persistent SARS-CoV-2  variant genotypes in four patients. These likely arose from within-host  evolution, although superinfection cannot be excluded in one case. Although our  dataset is small, observed sample-to-sample heterogeneity in variant frequencies  across four of nine patients suggests the presence of discrete viral populations  in the lung with incomplete population sampling in diagnostic swabs. Such  compartmentalization could compromise the penetration of remdesivir into the  lung, limiting the drugs in vivo efficacy, as has been observed in other lung  infections.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Remdesivir (RDV) is an inhibitor of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases that are active in some RNA viruses, including the Ebola virus and  zoonotic coronaviruses. When severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2  (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the etiologic agent of the coronavirus disease  2019 (COVID-19), several investigations have assessed the potential activity of  RDV in inhibiting viral replication, giving rise to hope for an effective  treatment. AREAS COVERED: In this review, the authors describe the main  investigations leading to the discovery of RDV and its subsequent development as  an antiviral agent, focusing on the main clinical trials investigating its  efficacy in terms of symptom resolution and mortality reduction. EXPERT OPINION:  RDV is the most widely investigated antiviral drug for the treatment of COVID-19.  This attention on RDV activity against SARS-CoV-2 is justified by promising in  vitro studies, which demonstrated that RDV was able to suppress viral replication  without significant toxicity. Such activity was confirmed by an investigation in  an animal model and by the results of preliminary clinical investigations.  Nevertheless, the efficacy of RDV in reducing mortality has not been clearly  demonstrated.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The impact of remdesivir (RDV) on mortality rates in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is controversial, and the mortality effect in subgroups  of baseline disease severity has been incompletely explored. The purpose of this  study was to assess the association of RDV with mortality rates in patients with  COVID-19. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study we compared persons  receiving RDV with those receiving best supportive care (BSC). Patients  hospitalized between 28 February and 28 May 2020 with laboratory-confirmed severe  acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection were included with the  development of COVID-19 pneumonia on chest radiography and hypoxia requiring  supplemental oxygen or oxygen saturation ≤94% with room air. The primary outcome  was overall survival, assessed with time-dependent Cox proportional hazards  regression and multivariable adjustment, including calendar time, baseline  patient characteristics, corticosteroid use, and random effects for hospital.  RESULTS: A total of 1138 patients were enrolled, including 286 who received RDV  and 852 treated with BSC, 400 of whom received hydroxychloroquine.  Corticosteroids were used in 20.4% of the cohort (12.6% in RDV and 23% in BSC).  Comparing persons receiving RDV with those receiving BSC, the hazard ratio (95%  confidence interval) for death was 0.46 (.31-.69) in the univariate model (P <  .001) and 0.60 (.40-.90) in the risk-adjusted model (P = .01). In the subgroup of  persons with baseline use of low-flow oxygen, the hazard ratio (95% confidence  interval) for death in RDV compared with BSC was 0.63 (.39-1.00; P = .049).  CONCLUSION: Treatment with RDV was associated with lower mortality rates than  BSC. These findings remain the same in the subgroup with baseline use of low-flow  oxygen.

However many patients decompensate despite being treated with remdesivir. To  identify potential prognostic factors in remdesivir-treated patients, we  performed a retrospective cohort study of patients hospitalized at  NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center between March 23, 2020  and May 27, 2020. We identified 55 patients who were treated with remdesivir for  COVID-19 and analyzed inflammatory markers and clinical outcomes. C-reactive  protein (CRP), d-dimer, and lactate dehydrogenase levels were significantly  higher in patients who progressed to intubation or death by 14 days compared to  those who remained stable. CRP levels decreased significantly after remdesivir  administration in patients who remained nonintubated over the study period. To  our knowledge, this is the largest study to date examining inflammatory markers  before and after remdesivir administration. Our findings support further  investigation into COVID-19 treatment strategies that modify the inflammatory  response.

AB  - PURPOSE: First detected in China in 2019, the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has rapidly spread globally. Since then, healthcare systems are  exposed to major challenges due to scarce personnel and financial resources.  Therefore, this analysis intended to examine treatment costs of COVID-19  inpatients in a German single centre during the first pandemic wave in 2020 from  a healthcare payer perspective. Potential cost savings were assessed considering  the administration of remdesivir according to the European Medicines Agency  label. METHODS: A retrospective medical-chart review was conducted on COVID-19  patients treated at University Hospital Cologne, Germany. Patients were clustered  according to an eight-category ordinal scale reflecting different levels of  supplemental oxygen. Potential cost savings due to the administration of  remdesivir were retrospectively modelled based on a reduced length of stay, as  shown in the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial. RESULTS: 105 COVID-19 patients  were identified. There was wide variability in the service data with median  treatment costs from EUR 900 to EUR 53,000 per patient, depending on major  diagnosis categories and clinical severity. No supplemental oxygen was needed in  40 patients (38.1%). Forty-three (41.0%) patients were treated in intensive-care  units, and 30 (69.8%) received invasive ventilation. In our model, in-label  administration of remdesivir would have resulted in costs savings of EUR 2100 per  COVID-19 inpatient (excluding acquisition costs). CONCLUSION: We found that  COVID-19 inpatients suffer from heterogeneous disease patterns with a variety of  incurred G-DRG tariffs and treatment costs. Theoretically shown in the model,  financial resources can be saved by the administration of remdesivir in eligible  inpatients.

AB  - Unfolded protein response (UPR) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress are aspects of SARS-CoV-2-host cell interaction with proposed role in the cytopathic and  inflammatory pathogenesis of this viral infection. The role of the NF-kB pathway  in these cellular processes remains poorly characterized. When investigated in  VERO-E6 cells, SARS-CoV-2 infection was found to markedly stimulate NF-kB protein  expression and activity. NF-kB activation occurs early in the infection process  (6 hpi) and it is associated with increased MAPK signaling and expression of the  UPR inducer IRE-1α. These signal transduction processes characterize the cellular  stress response to the virus promoting a pro-inflammatory environment and caspase  activation in the host cell. Inhibition of viral replication by the viral  protease inhibitor Nelfinavir reverts all these molecular changes also  stimulating c-Jun expression, a key component of the JNK/AP-1 pathway with  important role in the IRE-1α-mediated transcriptional regulation of stress  response genes with anti-inflammatory and cytoprotection function. The present  study demonstrates that UPR signaling and its interaction with cellular MAPKs and  the NF-kB activity are important aspects of SARS-CoV-2-host cell interaction that  deserve further investigation to identify more efficient therapies for this viral  infection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a scarcity of data comparing the consequences of first and second COVID-19 waves on kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) in India. METHODS:  We conducted a single-centre retrospective study of 259 KTRs with COVID-19 to  compare first wave (March 15-December 31 2020, n = 157) and second wave (April  1-May 31 2021, n = 102). RESULTS: KTRs during second wave were younger (43 vs.  40 years; p-value .04) and also included paediatric patients (0 vs. 5.9%; p-value  .003). Symptoms were milder during the second wave (45 vs. 62.7%; p-value .007);  COVID-19 positive patients had less frequent cough (32 vs. 13.8%; p-value .001),  fever was less frequent (58 vs. 37%; p-value .001), and we observed fewer  co-morbidities (11 vs. 20.6%; p-value .04). The percentages of neutrophils (77  vs. 83%; p-value .001) and serum ferritin (439 vs. 688; p-value .0006) were  higher during second wave, while lymphocyte counts were reduced (20 vs. 14%;  p-value .0001). Hydroxychloroquine (11 vs. 0%; p-value .0001) and tocilizumab (7  vs. 0%; p-value .004) were more frequently prescribed during first wave, while  utilization of dexamethasone (6 vs. 27%; p-value .0001) and remdesivir (47 vs.  65%; p-value .03) increased during the second wave. Mucormycosis (1.3 vs. 10%;  p-value .01) and ICU admissions (20 vs. 37.2%; p-value .002) were more frequent  during second wave. The 28-day mortality rate (9.6 vs. 10%; p-value 1) was not  different. CONCLUSIONS: There has been a different clinical spectrum of COVID-19  amongst KTR with similar mortality between the two waves at a large Indian  transplant centre.

AB  - BACKGROUND: During the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the identification of effective antiviral drugs is crucial. Unfortunately, no specific treatment or  vaccine is available to date. OBJECTIVE: Here, we aimed to predict the  interactions with SARS-CoV-2 proteins and protein targets from the human body for  some flavone molecules (kaempferol, morin, pectolinarin, myricitrin, and  herbacetin) in comparison to synthetic compounds (hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir,  ribavirin, ritonavir, AMD-070, favipiravir). METHODS: Using MOE software and  advanced bioinformatics and cheminformatics portals, we conducted an extensive  analysis based on various structural and functional features of compounds, such  as their amphiphilic field, flexibility, and steric features. The structural  similarity analysis of natural and synthetic compounds was performed using  Tanimoto coefficients. The interactions of some compounds with SARS-CoV-2  3CLprotease or RNA-dependent RNA polymerase were described using 2D  protein-ligand interaction diagrams based on known crystal structures. The  potential targets of considered compounds were identified using the  SwissTargetPrediction web tool. RESULTS: Our results showed that remdesivir,  pectolinarin, and ritonavir present a strong structural similarity which may be  correlated to their similar biological activity. As common molecular targets of  compounds in the human body, ritonavir, kaempferol, morin, and herbacetin can  activate multidrug resistance-associated proteins, while remdesivir, ribavirin,  and pectolinarin appear as ligands for adenosine receptors. CONCLUSION: Our  evaluation recommends remdesivir, pectolinarin, and ritonavir as promising anti-  SARS-CoV-2 agents.

AB  - The novel SARS-CoV-2 is a new disease that has caused severe destruction to human lives across the globe, including infection, mortality and financial crises, for  which, scientific researchers have been directed towards the development of  treatment and controlling measures against coronavirus. Currently, there has been  no approved drug for the treatment of the disease, but several antiviral drugs  have shown therapeutic effects from which, remdesivir and favipiravir are two  such drugs. These drugs have shown some therapeutic potential in the treatment of  COVID-19 by inhibiting viral enzyme RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The purpose of  this systematic review is to provide an overview of the effectiveness of these  two drugs based on the clinical trials reported in current published data.

AB  - Starting from the MLPCN probe compound ML300, a structure-based optimization campaign was initiated against the recent severe acute respiratory syndrome  coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) main protease (3CL(pro)). X-ray structures of SARS-CoV-1  and SARS-CoV-2 3CL(pro) enzymes in complex with multiple ML300-based inhibitors,  including the original probe ML300, were obtained and proved instrumental in  guiding chemistry toward probe compound 41 (CCF0058981). The disclosed inhibitors  utilize a noncovalent mode of action and complex in a noncanonical binding mode  not observed by peptidic 3CL(pro) inhibitors. In vitro DMPK profiling highlights  key areas where further optimization in the series is required to obtain useful  in vivo probes. Antiviral activity was established using a SARS-CoV-2-infected  Vero E6 cell viability assay and a plaque formation assay. Compound 41  demonstrates nanomolar activity in these respective assays, comparable in potency  to remdesivir. These findings have implications for antiviral development to  combat current and future SARS-like zoonotic coronavirus outbreaks.

T2  - Infection
AB  - PURPOSE: This review was aimed to synthesise the best available evidence on the effectiveness and safety of remdesivir in the treatment of moderate to severe  COVID-19. METHOD: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies  reporting the effectiveness and safety of remdesivir were searched via databases  and other sources from December 2019 to December 2020. Two independent reviewers  performed literature screening, data extraction and assessment of risk bias.  Seven studies involving 3686 patients were included. RESULTS: Treatment with  remdesivir was associated with an increase in clinical recovery rate by 21% (RR  1.21; 95% CI 1.08-1.35) on day 7 and 29% (RR 1.29; 95% CI 1.22-1.37) on day 14.  The likelihoods of requiring high-flow supplemental oxygen and invasive  mechanical ventilation in the remdesivir group were lower than in the placebo  group by 27% (RR 0.73; 95% CI 0.54-0.99) and 47% (RR 0.53; 95% CI 0.39-0.72),  respectively. Remdesivir-treated patients showed a 39% (RR 0.61; 95% CI  0.46-0.79) reduction in the risk of mortality on day 14 compared to the control  group; however, there was no significant difference on day 28. Serious adverse  effects (SAEs) were significantly less common in patients treated with  remdesivir, with an absolute risk difference of 6% (RD -0.06; 95% CI -0.09 to  -0.03). CONCLUSION: Despite conditional recommendation against its use,  remdesivir could still be effective in early clinical improvement; reduction of  early mortality and avoiding high-flow supplemental oxygen and invasive  mechanical ventilation among hospitalised COVID-19 patients. Remdesivir was also  well tolerated without significant SAEs compared to placebo, yet available  evidence from clinical studies support the need to conduct close monitoring.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To better inform clinical practice, we summarized the findings from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of antivirals for COVID-19. METHODS: We  systematically searched for literature up to September 2020, and included  English-language publications of RCTs among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. We  conducted network meta-analysis combining results of both the direct and indirect  comparisons of interventions. The efficacy outcomes were clinical progression,  all-cause mortality, and viral clearance, and safety outcomes were diarrhea,  nausea, and vomiting. We generated treatment rankings (best to worst) and  summarized rank probabilities using rankogram. RESULTS: We included 15 RCTs  (14,418 patients) from 7,237 retrieved citations. There was no evidence for  efficacy of the assessed antivirals compared with placebo/no treatment or with  another antiviral for all efficacy outcomes. Lopinavir (400 mg)/ritonavir (100  mg) significantly increased diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting compared with  placebo/no treatment and other antivirals, and was ranked worst for these  outcomes, while triazavirin (250 mg), baloxavir marboxil (80 mg), and remdesivir  (100 mg - 10 days) ranked best, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The  available evidence does not support the use of any antiviral drugs for COVID-19.  Cautious interpretations of the findings are, however, advised considering the  paucity of the evidence. More RCTs are needed for a stronger evidence base.

T2  - Current drug safety
AB  - Remdesivir is an adenosine analogue drug that targets RNA-dependent RNA polymerase enzyme and inhibits viral replication. As of 22nd October, 2020, US  FDA fully approved the drug Remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 patients who  requires hospitalisation. Many clinical studies reported the derangement in  hepatic and renal function tests, which is alarming considering the health  conditions of the COVID-19 patients. In view of these results, the present study  was envisaged to review the safety of Remdesivir in COVID-19 patients. The  PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched using the terms  'Remdesivir,' 'veklury,' 'SARS' and 'COVID' till 1st December, 2020. The studies  included in this meta-analysis were either randomised or nonrandomised studies  that evaluated Remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 against Placebo [standard  of care]. The Adverse events [AEs], Serious adverse events [SAEs] and Treatment  Discontinuation due to Adverse Events (TDAE) were used as primary outcome  measures. The quality of studies was evaluated by using the Cochrane  Collaboration's tool for the assessment of RoB. Data analysis was performed by  two authors (MK & DB) using statistical software Review manager [Revman] version  5.3. The pooled Risk Ratios (RR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) were  calculated by using a random-effects model for both primary and secondary  outcomes. A total of four RCTs were included for the meta-analysis. Out of the  four included clinical trials accepted for its methodological quality, three were  of excellent quality and one study was of moderate quality. The pooled estimates  of the three studies showed that Remdesivir had a 24% lower risk of SAEs compared  to the placebo arm. However, the pooled estimates of two studies showed that 10  days of Remdesivir had 56% higher risk of SAEs compared to 5 days of Remdesivir  regimen. Similarly, the 10 days of Remdesivir had two times higher risk of TDAEs  compared to 5 days Remdesivir regimen. In conclusion, our meta-analysis  demonstrated that Remdesivir is a safe therapeutic option. Our metanalysis  revealed 5 days' regimen have better safety profile than 10 days' regimen of drug  Remdesivir with respect to SAEs and TDAEs. For hospitalized patients, a 5-day  course could be preferable with fewer safety concerns and lower drug costs.  PROSPERO Registration ID: CRD 42020224272.

AB  - Immunosuppressed heart transplant (HT) recipients are thought to be at higher risk of infection and mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection coronavirus disease  2019 (COVID-19); however, evidence guiding management of HT patients are limited.  Retrospective search of electronic health records from February 2020 to February  2021, identified 28 HT recipients out of 400 followed by UC San Diego who tested  positive for SARS-CoV-2. Patient demographics, COVID-19 directed therapies,  hospital course and outcomes were compared to control HT recipients who tested  negative for SARS-CoV-2 during the same period (n = 80). Among 28 HT recipients  who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, 15 were admitted to the hospital and 13 were  monitored closely as outpatients. Among inpatients, five developed severe illness  and two died (7% mortality). Nine patients were treated with remdesivir, and four  received dexamethasone and remdesivir. Two outpatients received neutralizing  monoclonal antibody therapy and one outpatient received dexamethasone for  persistent dyspnea. Immunosuppressed HT recipients, especially Hispanic patients  and patients with higher body mass index, were at greater risk of infection and  mortality from COVID-19 than the general population. Use of remdesivir and  dexamethasone may have improved outcomes in our HT recipients compared to HT  recipients at other centers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new strain of coronavirus. It is characterized by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  (SARS-CoV-2). It has quickly influenced all over the world since it spreads  easily. Common symptoms are fever, cough, difficulty in breathing and muscle  aches. Despite the urgent need to find an effective antiviral treatment, already  available agents are being used alone or in combination all over the world. At  the beginning of the pandemic, death rates of infection caused by COVID-19 are  high but "is COVID-19 responsible for all deaths?", or "are there any  contributions of the frequently used drugs in this period to these deaths?"  Surely herd immunity plays a major role and has contributed to the decline in  mortality rates. Meanwhile, it is kept in mind that due to safety concerns,  changes have also been made in the dosage and combined use of frequently used  drugs. OBJECTIVE: In this review, answers to two questions above and the safety  of treatments, toxicities of agents involving chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine,  remdesivir, favipiravir, lopiravir/ritonavir, sarilumab, tocilizumab, siltuximab,  corticosteroids and bromhexine which are the most frequently used in Turkey and  all over the world will be summarized. CONCLUSION: Among these drugs, favipiravir  seems the most promising drug due to more tolerable adverse effects. More  clinical trials with large sample sizes are needed to find the most effective and  safe drug for COVID-19 treatment.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has already taken many lives but is still continuing its spread and exerting jeopardizing effects. This study is aimed to find the most  potent ligands from 703 analogs of remdesivir against RNA-dependent RNA  polymerase (RdRp) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  (SARS-CoV-2) virus . RdRp is a major part of a multi-subunit transcription  complex of the virus, which is essential for viral replication. In clinical  trials, it has been found that remdesivir is effective to inhibit viral  replication in Ebola and in primary human lung cell cultures; it effectively  impedes replication of a broad-spectrum pre-pandemic bat coronaviruses and  epidemic human coronaviruses. After virtual screening, 30 most potent ligands and  remdesivir were modified with triphosphate. Quantum mechanics-based quantitative  structure-activity relationship envisages the binding energy for ligands applying  partial least square (PLS) regression. PLS regression remarkably predicts the  binding energy of the effective ligands with an accuracy of 80% compared to the  value attained from molecular docking. Two ligands (L4:58059550 and  L28:126719083), which have more interactions with the target protein than the  other ligands including standard remdesivir triphosphate, were selected for  further analysis. Molecular dynamics simulation is done to assess the stability  and dynamic nature of the drug-protein complex. Binding-free energy results via  PRODIGY server and molecular mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area method  depict that the potential and solvation energies play a crucial role. Considering  all computational analysis, we recommend the best remdesivir analogs can be  utilized for efficacy test through in vitro and in vivo trials against  SARS-CoV-2.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 is the third rising epidemic in the 21st century that quickly turned into a worldwide pandemic. Many clinical studies have been  achieved to investigate treatments to confront COVID-19. Therefore, we conducted  a systematic review to describe the recent treatment strategies to treat COVID-19  patients. METHODS: A systematic search was performed in the databases of PubMed,  Scopus, Embase, Science direct, Up to date, and Web of Science using the keywords  of Coronavirus, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, Novel Coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, Treatment,  Medicine, Therapy, Intervention, Drug, Medications, and Cure. All the relevant  articles were collected from December 2019 to July 2020. RESULTS: We included 58  studies including 38 articles (eleven reviews, ten editorial documents, three  case reports, one mix method, one cohort study), and 19 published clinical  trials. Review of studies showed that Lopinavir/Ritonavir (n=16), Remdesivir  (n=13), Convalescent plasma (n=11), Chloroquine (n=11), Ribavirin (n=9),  Hydroxychloroquine sulfate (n=8), Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) (n=8), and  Arbidol (n=7), were the most frequently therapies used to treat COVID-19  patients. CONCLUSION: In the absence of definitive treatment protocols, recently  proposed approaches have appeared to be an effective therapy for accelerating the  recovery of COVID-19 patients. Some of these treatments may have been in the  early stages of testing. However, future preclinical and clinical trials are  warranted to validate findings.

AB  - The influence of Coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) on heart transplantation is considerable. Reports of COVID-19 infection in recently transplanted patients are  scarce. We present a 60-year-old male patient with COVID-19 infection, diagnosed  6 days after transplantation. His clinical course revealed 2 phases. Initially,  there were mild respiratory symptoms for which he was treated with remdesivir and  noninvasive respiratory support. In a second phase with clinical deterioration on  postoperative day 22, further respiratory decline led to the administration of  convalescent plasma, with satisfactory response and further improvement of his  condition.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence remains inconclusive on any significant benefits of remdesivir in patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. This study explored the  disease progression, various clinical outcomes, changes in viral load, and costs  associated with early remdesivir treatment among COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A  territory-wide retrospective cohort of 10 419 patients with COVID-19 hospitalized  from 21 January 2020 to 31 January 2021 in Hong Kong was identified. Early  remdesivir users were matched with controls using propensity-score matching in a  ratio ≤1:4. Study outcomes were time to clinical improvement of at least 1 point  on WHO clinical progression scale, hospital discharge, recovery, viral clearance,  low viral load, positive IgG antibody, in-hospital death, and composite outcomes  of in-hospital death requiring invasive ventilation or intensive care. RESULTS:  After multiple imputation and propensity-score matching, median follow-up was 14  days for both remdesivir (n = 352) and control (n = 1347) groups. Time to  clinical improvement was significantly shorter in the remdesivir group than that  of control (HR: 1.14; 95% CI: 1.01-1.29; P = .038), as well as for achieving low  viral load (1.51; 1.24-1.83; P < .001) and positive IgG antibody (1.50;  1.31-1.70; P < .001). Early remdesivir treatment was associated with lower risk  of in-hospital death (HR: .58; 95% CI: .34-.99; P = .045), in addition to a  significantly shorter length of hospital stay (difference: -2.56 days; 95% CI:  -4.86 to -.26; P = .029), without increasing risks of composite outcomes for  clinical deterioration. CONCLUSIONS: Early remdesivir treatment could be extended  to hospitalized patients with moderate COVID-19 not requiring oxygen therapy on  admission.

AB  - There is an urgent need for therapeutic interventions to alter the course of critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 (CO-VID-19) patients. We report our  experience with the Seraph-100 Microbind Affinity Blood Filter (Seraph-100) in 4  patients with COVID-19 early in the course of their critical respiratory  illnesses. Patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 and were admitted to intensive  care with worsening respiratory failure but did not require dialysis or  vasopressors. Patients had to have a PaO2 to FiO2 (P/F ratio) <150 to qualify for  hemoperfusion therapy. All patients received standard medical therapy including  oral vitamins C and D and zinc in addition to intravenous dexamethasone and  remdesivir. Patients received a single 5- to 7-h session with Seraph-100 on a  conventional dialysis machine (Fresenius 2008T) via a nontunneled central venous  dialysis catheter with a goal of processing at least 100 L of blood. Patients  received weight-based subcutaneous enoxaparin anticoagulation, as well as  systemic intravenous heparin (70 units/kg), just prior to hemofiltration.  Treatment with Seraph-100 hemoperfusion was well tolerated, and all patients were  able to finish their prescribed therapy. All patients treated with Seraph-100  survived to be discharged from the hospital. Well-designed clinical trials are  needed to determine the overall safety and efficacy of the Seraph-100 Microbind  Affinity Blood Filter in COVID-19 patients.

AB  - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) aka SARS-CoV spread over southern China for the first time in 2002-2003 and history repeated again since last year and  took away lives of more than two million people so far. On March 11, 2020  COVID-19 outbreak was officially declared as pandemic by World Health  Organization (WHO). The entire world united to fight back against this ultimate  destruction. Around 90 vaccines are featured against SARS-CoV-2 and more than 300  active clinical trials are underway by several groups and individuals. So far, no  drugs have been currently approved that can completely eliminate the deadly  coronavirus. The promising SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drugs are favipiravir,  remdesivir, lopinavir, ribavirin and avifavir. In this review, we have discussed  the synthetic approaches elaborately made so far by different groups and chemical  companies all around the world towards top three convincing anti-viral drugs  against SARS-CoV-2, which are favipiravir, remdesivir and lopinavir.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in the management of patients with COVID-19 continues to evolve. The purpose of this  analysis is to review our multi-institutional clinical experience involving 200  consecutive patients at 29 hospitals with confirmed COVID-19 supported with ECMO.  METHODS: This analysis includes our first 200 COVID-19 patients with complete  data who were supported with and separated from ECMO. These patients were  cannulated between March 17 and December 1, 2020. Differences by mortality group  were assessed using χ(2) tests for categoric variables and Kruskal-Wallis rank  sum tests and Welch's analysis of variance for continuous variables. RESULTS:  Median ECMO time was 15 days (interquartile range, 9 to 28). All 200 patients  have separated from ECMO: 90 patients (45%) survived and 110 patients (55%) died.  Survival with venovenous ECMO was 87 of 188 patients (46.3%), whereas survival  with venoarterial ECMO was 3 of 12 patients (25%). Of 90 survivors, 77 have been  discharged from the hospital and 13 remain hospitalized at the ECMO-providing  hospital. Survivors had lower median age (47 versus 56 years, P < .001) and  shorter median time from diagnosis to ECMO cannulation (8 versus 12 days, P =  .003). For the 90 survivors, adjunctive therapies on ECMO included intravenous  steroids (64), remdesivir (49), convalescent plasma (43), anti-interleukin-6  receptor blockers (39), prostaglandin (33), and hydroxychloroquine (22).  CONCLUSIONS: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation facilitates survival of select  critically ill patients with COVID-19. Survivors tend to be younger and have a  shorter duration from diagnosis to cannulation. Substantial variation exists in  drug treatment of COVID-19, but ECMO offers a reasonable rescue strategy.

AB  - Recurring coronavirus outbreaks, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, establish a necessity to develop direct-acting antivirals that can be readily administered  and are active against a broad spectrum of coronaviruses. Described in this  Article are novel α-acyloxymethylketone warhead peptidomimetic compounds with a  six-membered lactam glutamine mimic in P1. Compounds with potent SARS-CoV-2 3CL  protease and in vitro viral replication inhibition were identified with low  cytotoxicity and good plasma and glutathione stability. Compounds 15e, 15h, and  15l displayed selectivity for SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease over CatB and CatS and  superior in vitro SARS-CoV-2 antiviral replication inhibition compared with the  reported peptidomimetic inhibitors with other warheads. The cocrystallization of  15l with SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease confirmed the formation of a covalent adduct.  α-Acyloxymethylketone compounds also exhibited antiviral activity against an  alphacoronavirus and non-SARS betacoronavirus strains with similar potency and a  better selectivity index than remdesivir. These findings demonstrate the  potential of the substituted heteroaromatic and aliphatic α-acyloxymethylketone  warheads as coronavirus inhibitors, and the described results provide a basis for  further optimization.

AB  - The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, responsible for the present COVID-19 global pandemic, is known to bind to the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor  in human cells. A possible treatment of COVID-19 could involve blocking ACE2  and/or disabling the spike protein on the virus. Here, molecular dynamics  simulations were performed to test the binding affinities of nine candidate  compounds. Of these, three drugs showed significant therapeutic potential that  warrant further investigation: SN35563, a ketamine ester analogue, was found to  bind strongly to the ACE2 receptor but weakly within the spike receptor-binding  domain (RBD); in contrast, arbidol and hydroxychloroquine bound preferentially  with the spike RBD rather than ACE2. A fourth drug, remdesivir, bound  approximately equally to both the ACE2 and viral spike RBD, thus potentially  increasing risk of viral infection by bringing the spike protein into closer  proximity to the ACE2 receptor. We suggest more experimental investigations to  test that SN35563-in combination with arbidol or hydroxychloroquine-might act  synergistically to block viral cell entry by providing therapeutic blockade of  the host ACE2 simultaneous with reduction of viral spike receptor-binding; and  that this combination therapy would allow the use of smaller doses of each  drug.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the novel coronavirus responsible for the current global pandemic, which first emerged in  December 2019. This coronavirus has affected 217 countries worldwide, most of  which have enacted non-remedial preventive measures, such as nationwide  lockdowns, work from home, travel bans, and social isolation. Pharmacists,  doctors, nurses, technologists, and other healthcare professionals have played  pivotal roles during this pandemic. Unfortunately, confirmed drugs have not been  identified for the treatment of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)  caused by SARSCoV2; however, favipiravir and remdesivir have been reported as  promising antiviral drugs. Some vaccines have already been developed, and  vaccination is ongoing globally. Various nanotechnologies are currently being  developed in many countries for preventing SARS-CoV-2 spread and treating  COVID-19 infections. In this article, we present an overview of the COVID-19  pandemic situation and discuss nanotechnology-based approaches and  investigational therapeutics for COVID-19.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We systematically reviewed the evidence of published original research to determine the role of remdesivir in the management of patients with COVID-19  and a moderate-to-severe course of illness. METHODS: A systematic search of  articles was conducted in scientific databases, with the latest update in May  2021. This paper systematically reviewed the clinical evidence available  (randomized controlled trials, compassionate use studies, and case reports) on  the use of remdesivir for patients with moderate or severe COVID-19. RESULTS: A  total of eleven studies were included: four studies based on compassionate use of  remdesivir, three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre  trials, three randomized, open-label, phase III trials, and one case report.  Clinical improvement and mortality rates in patients who used remdesivir varied  across studies. CONCLUSION: Given the current evidence, there is insufficient  data to confidently recommend the use of remdesivir alone for the treatment of  adult hospitalized patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19. However, remdesivir  may be considered along with an anti-inflammatory agent in patients with  pneumonia, on oxygen support, provided there is close monitoring of clinical and  laboratory parameters and adverse events.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic with psychiatric comorbidities leads to a scenario in which the use of psychotropic drugs may be required. This requires  the support of evidence-based medicine to take into account possible interactions  between antidepressants, mood stabilizers, benzodiazepines, and coronavirus  infection treatments. METHODS: Three databases were consulted: (a) Lexicomp Drug  Interactions, (b) Micromedex Solutions Drugs Interactions, (c)Liverpool Drug  Interaction Group for COVID-19 therapies. The CredibleMeds QTDrugs List was also  queried. Hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin, lopinavir-ritonavir,  remdesivir, favipiravir, tocilizumab, baricitinib, anakinra, and dexamethasone -  drugs used for SARS-CoV-2 - were analyzed, and consensus recommendations are  made. RESULTS: The potential interactions of agomelatine, desvenlafaxine,  duloxetine, milnacipran, and vortioxetine with COVID-19 treatments shall be  considered less risky. Antidepressant interactions with hydroxychloroquine,  chloroquine, and azithromycin enhance the risk of QT prolongation, and ECG  monitoring is advised for most antidepressants. Antidepressants with  lopinavir/ritonavir involve multiple CYP enzyme interactions (except with  milnacipran). Gabapentin, oxcarbazepine, pregabalin, topiramate, and zonisamide  are safe treatment options that have no significant interactions with COVID-19  treatments. Lithium is contraindicated with hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and  azithromycin. Precaution should be taken in using valproic acid with  lopinavir-ritonavir. The use of benzodiazepines does not present a risk of drug  interaction with COVID-19 treatments, except lopinavir/ritonavir. CONCLUSIONS:  Clinicians prescribing antidepressants, mood stabilizers/anticonvulsants, and  benzodiazepines, should be aware of the probable risk of drug-drug interaction  with COVID-19 medications and may benefit from heeding these recommendations for  use to ensure patient safety.

AB  - Human beings are in dire need of developing an efficient treatment against fierce viruses like hepatitis C virus (HCV) and Coronavirus (COVID-19). These viruses  have already caused the death of over two million people all over the world.  Therefore, over the last years, many direct-acting antiviral drugs (DAADs) were  developed targeting nonstructural proteins of these two viruses. Among these  DAADs, several drugs were found more effective and safer than the others as  sofosbuvir, ledipasvir, grazoprevir, glecaprevir, voxilaprevir, velpatasvir,  elbasvir, pibrentasvir and remdesivir. The last one is indicated for COVID-19,  while the rest are indicated for HCV treatment. Due to the valuable impact of  these DAADs, larger number of analytical methods were required to meet the needs  of the clinical studies. Therefore, this review will highlight the current  approaches, published in the period between 2017 to present, dealing with the  determination of these drugs in two different matrices: pharmaceuticals and  biological fluids with the challenges of analyzing these drugs either alone, with  other drugs, in presence of interferences (pharmaceutical excipients or  endogenous plasma components) or in presence of matrix impurities, degradation  products and metabolites. These approaches include spectroscopic,  chromatographic, capillary electrophoretic, voltametric and nuclear magnetic  resonance methods that have been reported during this period. Moreover, the  analytical instrumentation and methods used in determination of these DAADs will  be illustrated in tabulated forms.

AB  - The current research used a virtual screening method to study 57 isolated phytochemicals (alkaloids, phytosterols, and flavonoids) against the SARS-CoV-2  main protease (M(pro)). The absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and  toxicity (ADMET) of the selected compounds were analysed using admetSAR tool  while SwissADME and Molinspiration chemoinformatics tools were used to examine  the oral bioavailability and drug-likeness properties. Parameters such as  physicochemical properties, activity spectra for substances (PASS) prediction,  bioactivity, binding mode, and molecular interactions were also analysed. Our  results favoured Lupeol (-8.6 kcal/mol), Lupenone (-7.7 kcal/mol), Hesperetin  (-7.4 kcal/mol), Apigenin (-7.3 kcal/mol) and Castasterone (-7.3 kcal/mol) as  probable inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2. This is because of their good binding  affinities, bioactivities, drug-likeness, ADMET properties, PASS properties, oral  bioavailability, binding mode and their interactions with the active site of the  target receptor compared to Remdesivir and Azithromycin. Therefore, these  compounds could be explored towards the development of new therapeutic agents  against SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Recently, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome cornoavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has become a great  perturbation all around the globe and has many devastating effects on every  aspect of life. Apart from the oxygen therapy and extracorporeal membrane  oxygenation, Remdesivir and Dexamethasone have been proven to be efficacious  against COVID-19, along with various vaccine candidates and monoclonal antibody  cocktail therapy for Regeneron. All of these are currently at different stages of  clinical trials. People with weak immunity are more prone to a severe infection  of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, early and judicious nutritional supplementation along  with pharmacological treatment and clinician collaborations are critical in  restituting the current situation. Nutritional supplements help in acquiring  strong immunity to prevent the progression of disease any further. Vitamin C,  vitamin D, selenium, zinc and many other nutritional and dietary supplements  inhibit the production of inflammatory cytokines during a viral infection and  prevents several unwanted symptoms of infection. Many dietary components like  citrus fruits, black elderberry, ginger, and probiotics have the ability to  attack viral replication. These supplements can also tame the overriding immune  system during coronavirus infection. Keeping in view these facts, nutritional and  dietary supplements can be used along with other management modalities. These  nutritional and dietary supplements are potential candidates to curb the  convulsive unfolding of novel COVID-19, in combination with other standard  treatment protocols. In this review, various search engines were used to exploit  available literature in order to provide a comprehensive review on nutritional  and dietary supplements with respect to the viral infections. It will also  provide a brief overview on some of the clinical trials that are in progress to  assess the role of nutritional supplements, either alone or in combination with  other pharmacological drugs, in fight against COVID-19.

AB  - Remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine derivatives form two important classes of heterocyclic compounds. They are known for their anti-malarial biological  activity. This research aims to analyze the physicochemical properties of  remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine compounds by the computational approach. DFT,  docking, and POM analyses also identify antiviral pharmacophore sites of both  compounds. The antiviral activity of hydroxychloroquine compound's in the  presence of zinc sulfate and azithromycin is evaluated through its capacity to  coordinate transition metals (M = Cu, Ni, Zn, Co, Ru, Pt). The obtained  bioinformatic results showed the potent antiviral/antibacterial activity of the  prepared mixture (Hydroxychloroquine/Azithromycin/Zinc sulfate) for all the  opportunistic Gram-positive, Gram-negative in the presence of coronavirus  compared with the complexes Polypyridine-Ruthenium-di-aquo. The postulated  zinc(II) complex of hydroxychloroquine derivatives are indeed an effective  antibacterial and antiviral agent against coronavirus and should be extended to  other pathogens. The combination of a pharmacophore site with a redox  [Metal(OH(2))(2)] moiety is of crucial role to fight against viruses and bacteria  strains. [Formula: see text]Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

AU  - Maeda, Hideki
T2  - Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics
AB  - The development of drugs for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global challenge. In Japan, remdesivir was approved in May 2020 for COVID-19 caused by  the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. In  February 2021, a vaccine against COVID-19 was approved. These two approvals were  made using the Special Approval for Emergency system in Japan. This Japanese  system was started in 2010 and has been used to approve four drugs to date,  including remdesivir and the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. This paper discusses future  challenges for Japan's Special Approval for Emergency system and organizes what  can be learned from experiences to date. As a result, I would like to point Out  the following issues. (i) Special Approval for Emergency is a system for  approving drugs approved overseas, not a system for approving drugs originally  developed in Japan. A system to approve drugs that have not been approved in  foreign countries needs to be considered. (ii) In the Special Approval for  Emergency system, it is necessary to ensure that postmarketing activities are  conducted in accordance with the Risk Management Plan and the conditions of  approval, to disclose the results in a timely and speedy manner, and to judge the  appropriateness of continued approval based on the results of postmarketing  activities.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has severely destructed human life worldwide, with no suitable treatment until now. SARS-CoV-2 virus is unprecedented, resistance  against number of therapeutics and spreading rapidly with high mortality, which  warrants the need to discover new effective drugs to combat this situation. This  current study is undertaken to explore the antiviral potential of marine algal  compounds to inhibit the viral entry and its multiplication using computational  analysis. Among the proven drug discovery targets of SARS-CoV-2, spike  glycoprotein and 3-chymotrypsin-like protease are responsible for the virus  attachment and viral genome replication in the host cell. In this study, the  above-mentioned drug targets were docked with marine algal compounds (sulfated  polysaccharides, polysaccharide derivatives and polyphenols) using molecular  docking tools (AutoDockTools). The obtained results indicate that κ-carrageenan,  laminarin, eckol, trifucol and β-D-galactose are the top-ranking compounds  showing better docking scores with SARS-CoV-2 targets, than the current  experimental COVID-19 antiviral drugs like dexamethasone, remdesivir, favipiravir  and MIV-150. Further, molecular dynamic simulation, ADMET and density functional  theory calculations were evaluated to substantiate the findings. To the best of  our knowledge, this is the first report on in silico analysis of aforesaid algal  metabolites against SARS-CoV-2 targets. This study concludes that these  metabolites can be curative for COVID-19 in the hour of need after further  validations in in vitro and in vivo testings.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

AB  - Outbreaks due to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Corona virus 2 (SARSCoV- 2) initiated in Wuhan city, China, in December 2019 and continued to spread  Internationally, posing a pandemic threat as declared by WHO and as of March 10,  2021, confirmed cases reached 118 million along with 2.6 million deaths  worldwide. In the absence of specific antiviral medication, symptomatic treatment  and physical isolation remain the options to control the disease and contagion.  The recent clinical trials on antiviral drugs highlighted some promising  compounds such as umifenovir (haemagglutininand has only 70% similarity to  SAmediated fusion inhibitor), remdesivir (RdRp nucleoside inhibitor), and  favipiravir (RdRp Inhibitor). WHO launched a multinational clinical trial on  several promising analogs as a potential treatment to combat SARS infection. This  situation urges a holistic approach to invent safe and specific drugs as a  prophylactic and therapeutic cure for SARS-related viral diseases, including  COVID-19. It is significant to note that researchers worldwide have been doing  their best to handle the crisis and have produced an extensive and promising  literature body. It opens a scope and allows understanding the viral entry at the  molecular level. A structure-based approach can reveal the molecular-level  understanding of viral entry interaction. The ligand profiling and non-covalent  interactions among participating amino-acid residues are critical information to  delineate a structural interpretation. The structural investigation of SARS virus  entry into host cells will reveal the possible strategy for designing drugs like  entry inhibitors. The structure-based approach demonstrates details at the 3D  molecular level. It shows specificity about SARS-CoV-2 spike interaction, which  uses human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor for entry, and  the human protease completes the process of viral fusion and infection. The 3D  structural studies reveal the existence of two units, namely S1 and S2. S1 is  called a receptor-binding domain (RBD) and responsible for interacting with the  host (ACE2), and the S2 unit participates in the fusion of viral and cellular  membranes. TMPRSS2 mediates the cleavage at the S1/S2 subunit interface in the  S-protein of SARS CoV-2, leading to viral fusion. Conformational difference  associated with S1 binding alters ACE2 interaction and inhibits viral fusion.  Overall, the detailed 3D structural studies help understand the 3D structural  basis of interaction between viruses with host factors and open scope for the new  drug discovery process targeting SARS-related virus entry into the host cell.

METHODS:  We identified enrollees in the national United States Veterans Affairs healthcare  system who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 between 28 February 2020 and 30  September 2020 (n = 55 952), with follow-up extending to 19 November 2020. We  determined trends over time in incidence of the following outcomes that occurred  within 30 days of testing positive: hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU)  admission, mechanical ventilation, and death. RESULTS: Between February and July  2020, there were marked downward trends in the 30-day incidence of  hospitalization (44.2% to 15.8%), ICU admission (20.3% to 5.3%), mechanical  ventilation (12.7% to 2.2%), and death (12.5% to 4.4%), which subsequently  plateaued between July and September 2020. These trends persisted after  adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics, comorbid conditions, documented  symptoms, and laboratory tests, including among subgroups of patients  hospitalized, admitted to the ICU, or treated with mechanical ventilation. From  February to September, there were decreases in the use of hydroxychloroquine  (56.5% to 0%), azithromycin (48.3% to 16.6%), vasopressors (20.6% to 8.7%), and  dialysis (11.6% to 3.8%) and increases in the use of dexamethasone (3.4% to  53.1%), other corticosteroids (4.9% to 29.0%), and remdesivir (1.7% to 45.4%)  among hospitalized patients. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of adverse outcomes in  SARS-CoV-2-positive patients decreased markedly between February and July, with  subsequent stabilization from July to September. These trends were not explained  by changes in measured baseline patient characteristics and may reflect changing  treatment practices or viral pathogenicity.

AB  - The coronavirus pandemic hit the world lately and caused acute respiratory syndrome in humans. The causative agent of the disease was soon identified by  scientists as SARS-CoV-2 and later called a novel coronavirus by the general  public. Due to the severity and rapid spread of the disease, WHO classifies the  COVID-19 pandemic as the 6th public health emergency even after taking efforts  like worldwide quarantine and restrictions. Since only symptomatic treatment is  available, the best way to control the spread of the virus is by taking  preventive measures. Various types of antigen/antibody detection kits and  diagnostic methods are available for the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients. In  recent years, various phytochemicals and repurposing drugs showing a broad range  of anti-viral activities with different modes of actions have been identified.  Repurposing drugs such as arbidol, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, lopinavir,  favipiravir, remdesivir, hexamethylene amiloride, dexamethasone, tocilizumab,  interferon-β, and neutralizing antibodies exhibit in vitro anti-coronaviral  properties by inhibiting multiple processes in the virus life cycle. Various  research groups are involved in drug trials and vaccine development. Plant-based  antiviral compounds such as baicalin, calanolides, curcumin, oxymatrine, matrine,  and resveratrol exhibit different modes of action against a wide range of  positive/negative sense-RNA/DNA virus, and future researches need to be conducted  to ascertain their role and use in managing SARS-CoV-2. Thus this article is an  attempt to review the current understanding of COVID- 19 acute respiratory  disease and summarize its clinical features with their prospective control and  various aspects of the therapeutic approach.

AB  - Patients with hemato-oncologic diseases are particularly vulnerable to severe infections. Adult patients with blood cancers infected with SARS-CoV-2 had poorer  treatment outcomes and higher mortality than patients with COVID-19 without  burden. However, in pediatric patients with hemato-oncologic diseases the course  of COVID-19 is milder than in adults in the same group of patients. In this  report, we describe the case of our patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia  infected with SARS-CoV-2 and treated with remdesivir. We also review the existing  literature of pediatric patients who have been diagnosed with both  hemato-oncologic diseases and COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Since the introduction of remdesivir and dexamethasone for severe COVID-19 treatment, few large multi-hospital-system US studies have described  clinical characteristics and outcomes of minority COVID-19 patients who present  to the emergency department (ED). METHODS: This cohort study from the Cerner Real  World Database (87 US health systems) from 1 December 2019 to 30 September 2020  included PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients who self-identified as non-Hispanic  Black (Black), Hispanic White (Hispanic), or non-Hispanic White (White). The main  outcome was hospitalization among ED patients. Secondary outcomes included  mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit care, and in-hospital mortality.  Descriptive statistics and Poisson regression compared sociodemographics,  comorbidities, receipt of remdesivir or dexamethasone, and outcomes by  racial/ethnic groups and geographic region. RESULTS: 94 683 COVID-19 patients  presented to the ED. Blacks comprised 26.7% and Hispanics 33.6%. Nearly half  (45.1%) of ED patients presented to hospitals in the South. 31.4% (n = 29 687)  were hospitalized. Lower proportions of Blacks were prescribed dexamethasone  (29.4%; n = 7426) compared with Hispanics (40.9%; n = 13 021) and Whites (37.5%;  n = 14 088). Hospitalization risks, compared with Whites, were similar in Blacks  (RR: .94; 95% CI: .82-1.08; P = .4) and Hispanics (.99; .81-1.21; P = .91), but  risk of in-hospital mortality was higher in Blacks (1.18; 1.06-1.31; P = .002)  and Hispanics (1.28; 1.13-1.44; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Minority patients were  overrepresented among COVID-19 ED patients, and while their risks of  hospitalization were similar to Whites, in-hospital mortality risk was higher.  Interventions targeting upstream social determinants of health are needed to  reduce racial/ethnic disparities in COVID-19.

AB  - Since the outbreak emerged in November 2019, no effective drug has yet been found against SARS-CoV-2. Repositioning studies of existing drug molecules or  candidates are gaining in overcoming COVID-19. Antiviral drugs such as  remdesivir, favipiravir, ribavirin, and galidesivir act by inhibiting the vital  RNA polymerase of SARS-CoV-2. The importance of in silico studies in repurposing  drug research is gradually increasing during the COVID-19 process. The present  study found that especially ribavirin triphosphate and galidesivir triphosphate  active metabolites had a higher affinity for SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase than ATP  by molecular docking. With the Molecular Dynamics simulation, we have observed  that these compounds increase the complex's stability and validate the molecular  docking results. We also explained that the interaction of RNA polymerase  inhibitors with Mg(++), which is in the structure of NSP12, is essential and  necessary to interact with the RNA strand. In vitro and clinical studies on these  two molecules need to be increased.

T2  - Mini reviews in medicinal chemistry
AB  - Due to the high mortality rate of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, there is an immediate need to discover drugs that can help before a  vaccine becomes available. Given that the process of producing new drugs is so  long, the strategy of repurposing existing drugs is one of the promising options  for the urgent treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19 disease. Although FDA has approved  Remdesivir for the use in hospitalized adults and pediatric patients suffering  from COVID-19, no fully effective and reliable drug has been yet identified  worldwide to treat COVID-19 specifically. Thus, scientists are still trying to  find antivirals specific to COVID-19. This work reviews the chemical structure,  metabolic pathway, and mechanism of action of the existing drugs with potential  therapeutic applications for COVID-19. Furthermore, we summarized the molecular  docking stimulation of the medications related to key protein targets. These  already established drugs could be further developed, and after their testing  through clinical trials, they could be used as suitable therapeutic options for  patients suffering from COVID-19.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is one of the most infectious diseases which has been caused by coronavirus in 2019 (COVID-19). It  has widely spread worldwide and infected more than 28 million people in 215  countries, and more than 920,000 have now died from COVID-19. To date, no  effective antiviral drugs or specific vaccines have been discovered yet.  Considering this situation, the potential therapeutic antiviral drug targets for  the COVID-19 are being repurposed to speed up the discovery of effective  treatment. The most potential drug targets that are continuously being  recommended include Favipiravir, Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine, and Remdesivir.  Moreover, the antiviral target proteins and anti-host target proteins are being  reported continuously. This review has summarized the current research studies on  potential therapeutic drug targets that are being tested against the SARS-CoV-2.  It will provide information related to potential repurposing drugs for overcoming  COVID-19.

AB  - We report a case of acute pancreatitis that developed after four days of remdesivir therapy in a patient being treated for COVID-19. Despite improvement  in patient's respiratory status, abdominal pain worsened and clinical signs and  symptoms progressed to a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis 4 days after initiation  of remdesivir therapy. Withdrawal of remdesivir paired with medical management of  acute pancreatitis led to the resolution of pancreatitis within three days. To  our knowledge, this is the first case report depicting remdesivir as a possible  cause of acute pancreatitis.

AB  - The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in a global pandemic due to the rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus  2 (SARS-CoV-2). At the time of this manuscript's publication, remdesivir is the  only COVID-19 treatment approved by the United States Food and Drug  Administration. However, its effectiveness is still under question due to the  results of the large Solidarity Trial conducted by the World Health Organization.  Herein, we report that the parent nucleoside of remdesivir, GS-441524, potently  inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 and other cell lines. Challenge  studies in both an AAV-hACE2 mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 and in mice infected with  murine hepatitis virus, a closely related coronavirus, showed that GS-441524 was  highly efficacious in reducing the viral titers in CoV-infected organs without  notable toxicity. Our results support that GS-441524 is a promising and  inexpensive drug candidate for treating of COVID-19 and other CoV diseases.

AB  - Momordica dioica have proven medicinal potential of antidiabetic, antiviral and immune stimulating properties. Flavonoids and triterpenoids from M. dioica were  more extensively investigated for antiviral, antidiabetic and immunomodulatory  activities. In this present study, we have predicted the reported bioactive  flavonoids and triterpenoids of the plant against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease,  RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), spike protein, angiotensin converting enzyme  (ACE-2) receptor and dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP4) receptor through molecular  docking and in silico ADME predictions methods. According to the binding  affinities, the two triterpenoids, hederagenin and oleanolic acid exhibited the  best docking scores with these proteins than the catechin and quercetin with  compared to standard remdesivir, favipiravir and hydroxychloroquine. The in vitro  protein-drug studies have also showed significant interaction of catechin and  quercetin compounds than standard drugs. The in silico binding studies correlated  with the in silico binding studies. Further, M. dioica being used as antidiabetic  and its metabolite had significant interaction with DDP4, a comorbidity protein  involved in aiding the viral entry. Out of all the natural ligands, quercetin was  reported relatively good and safe for humans with high gastrointestinal tract  permeability and poor blood brain barrier crossing abilities. Hence, M. dioica  phytocompounds reflects promising therapeutic properties against SARS-CoV-2  infections under comorbid conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and  kidney disorders.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

AB  - The acute respiratory syndrome caused by the SARS-CoV-2, known as COVID-19, has been ruthlessly tormenting the world population for more than six months.  However, so far no effective drug or vaccine against this plague have emerged  yet, despite the huge effort in course by researchers and pharmaceutical  companies worldwide. Willing to contribute with this fight to defeat COVID-19, we  performed a virtual screening study on a library containing Food and Drug  Administration (FDA) approved drugs, in a search for molecules capable of hitting  three main molecular targets of SARS-CoV-2 currently available in the Protein  Data Bank (PDB). Our results were refined with further molecular dynamics (MD)  simulations and MM-PBSA calculations and pointed to 7 multi-target hits which we  propose here for experimental evaluation and repurposing as potential drugs  against COVID-19. Additional rounds of docking, MD simulations and MM-PBSA  calculations with remdesivir suggested that this compound can also work as a  multi-target drug against SARS-CoV-2.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

AB  - Coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) are seriously affecting human health all over the world. Nucleotide inhibitors have promising results in terms of its  efficacy against different viral polymerases. In this study, detailed molecular  docking and dynamics simulations are used to evaluate the binding affinity of a  clinically approved drug, sofosbuvir, with the solved structure of the viral  protein RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and compare it to the clinically  approved drug, Remdesivir. These drugs are docked onto the three-dimensional  structure of the nsp12 protein of SARS-CoV-2, which controls the polymerization  process. Hence, it is considered one of the primary therapeutic targets for  coronaviruses. Sofosbuvir is a drug that is currently used for HCV treatment;  therefore, HCV RdRp is used as a positive control protein target. The protein  dynamics are simulated for 100 ns, while the binding is tested during different  dynamics states of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. Additionally, the drug-protein complexes  are further simulated for 20 ns to explore the binding mechanism. The interaction  of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp as a target with the active form of sofosbuvir as a ligand  demonstrates binding effectiveness. One of the FDA-approved antiviral drugs, such  as sofosbuvir, can help us in this mission, aiming to limit the danger of  COVID-19. Sofosbuvir was found to bind nsp12 with comparable binding energies to  that of Remdesivir, which has been reported for its potential against COVID-19  RdRp and is currently approved by the FDA.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is associated with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) that ranges  from mild symptoms to cardiopulmonary collapse. A 5-year-old girl presented with  shock and a rapid decline in left ventricular function requiring intubation.  SARS-CoV-2 was diagnosed by viral Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), and she  received remdesivir and COVID-19 convalescent plasma. Initial echocardiogram  (ECHO) demonstrated low normal left ventricular function and mild left anterior  descending coronary artery dilation. She remained hypotensive, despite high-dose  epinephrine and norepinephrine infusions as well as stress-dose hydrocortisone.  Admission SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay was positive, meeting the criteria for MIS-C. An  ECHO 9 hours after admission demonstrated a severe decline in left ventricular  function. Due to severe cardiogenic shock, she was cannulated for venoarterial  extracorporeal support (ECMO). During her ECMO course, she was treated with  remdesivir, intravenous methylprednisolone, intravenous immunoglobulin, and  anakinra. She was decannulated on ECMO day 7, extubated the following day, and  discharged home 2 weeks later without respiratory or cardiac support. The use of  ECMO for cardiopulmonary support for pediatric patients with MIS-C is feasible  and should be considered early as part of the treatment algorithm for patients  with severe cardiopulmonary dysfunction.

AB  - In silico analysis of six phytochemicals, flabelliferin, marmelosin, piperine, ocimin, curcumin and leucoanthocyanin, along with three drug compounds,  nelfinavir, remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine, as positive control against drug  targets of one SARS-CoV-2 viral protease, COVID-19 main protease (SARS CoV-2  3CL(pro)/M(pro)), two coronavirus proteases, SARS-CoV main peptidase (SARS CoV  M(pro)), SARS-CoV main proteinase (SARS CoV 3CL(pro)), and one human cellular  transmembrane serine proteinase (TMPRSS2), was carried out. Except  leucoanthocyanin all other phytochemicals proved better than all three positive  control drugs against SARS-CoV main peptidase, whereas, flabelliferin was found  to be the potential inhibitor for SARS-CoV main proteinase out performing all the  positive control drugs and phytochemicals. Amongst the compounds studied, the  best inhibitor for COVID-19 main protease was nelfinavir followed by  flabelliferin and ocimin. Flabelliferin was found to the best promising inhibitor  of human cellular transmembrane serine proteinase, followed by nelfinavir,  curcumin, piperine and marmelosin. The result on the inhibition of human cellular  transmembrane serine proteinase against COVID-19 has a stable therapeutic  advantage as mutation may quickly occur on viral drug targets. Hence, all the  phytochemicals tested in the present study are the potential inhibitors of the  all the four drug targets and can form a part of therapeutics against COVID-19  with further clinical studies.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

AB  - Relapse of infection due to SARS-CoV-2 has been rarely described and there is little guidance regarding the management of such cases in immunocompromised  hosts. We present a case of an adolescent female with B-cell acute lymphoblastic  leukemia hospitalized multiple times for symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection who was  safely treated with 2 courses of remdesivir (RDV) and has had no additional  readmissions to date. Though additional studies are needed to confirm the safety  and efficacy of an additional course of RDV in the setting of relapsed or  prolonged severe COVID-19, our observations suggest that a second course of RDV  may be considered.

AB  - Like common cold and flu, SARC-CoV-2 virus spreads by droplets of sneezes or coughs which virus affects people of various age groups. Today, this virus is  almost distributed all over the world. Since binding process plays a crucial role  between host and receptor, therefore, we studied the molecules intended toward  inhibition process through molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation  process. From the molecular docking study, it is noteworthy that remdesivir shows  better binding affinity toward the main protease of SARS-CoV2 compared to other  studied drugs. Within studied phytochemicals, carnosic acid shows better binding  poses toward main protease of SARS-CoV2 among studied phytochemicals. The amino  acid residues GLN110 and PHE294 were almost found in all the studied interactions  of drugs and phytochemicals with main protease of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the  results show a larger contribution of the Van der Waals energies as compared to  others like electrostatic energies suggesting that ligands at the binding pocket  are predominantly stabilized by hydrophobic interactions. The conformational  change during ligand binding was predicted from Gibbs free energy landscape  analysis through molecular dynamics simulation. We observed that, there were two  main free energy basins for both docked carnosic acid complex and for docked  remdesivir complex, only one main free energy basin was found in the global free  energy minimum region.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 cause fatal infection in 213 countries accounting for the death of millions of people globally. In the present study, phytochemicals from spices  were assessed for their ability to interact with SARS-CoV-2 M(Pro). Structure  based virtual screening was performed with 146 phytochemicals from spices using  Autodock Vina. Phytochemicals with binding energy ≥ -8.0 kcal/mol were selected  to understand their interaction with M(Pro). Virtual screening was further  validated by performing molecular docking to generate favorable docked poses and  the participation of important amino acid residues. Molecular dynamics simulation  for the docked poses was performed to study thermodynamic properties of the  protein, ligand and protein-ligand complexes. The finding shows that cinnamtannin  B2 and cyanin showed favorable binding affinity values with SARS-CoV-2 M(Pro).  The results are comparable in terms of docked poses, important amino acid  participation and thermodynamic properties with the standard control drugs  remdesivir, benazepril and hydroxychloroquine diphosphate. Prime MM-GBSA was  employed for end-point binding energy calculation. Binding to domain I and II of  M(Pro) were mediated through the OH, SH, NH(2) and non-polar side chain of amino  acids. Cinnamtannin B2 and cyanin binds to M(Pro) with many sub sites within the  active site with RMSD and RMSF within 4 Å. The results computed using Prime  MM-GBSA show that cinnamtannin B2 (-68.54940214 kcal/mol) and cyanin  (-62.1902835 kcal/mol) have better binding affinity in comparison to  hydroxychloroquine diphosphate (-54.00912412 kcal/mol) and benazepril  (-53.70242369 kcal/mol). The results provide a basis for exploiting cinnamtannin  B2 and cyanin as a starting point potential candidate for the development of drug  against SARS-CoV-2.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

AB  - In December 2019, when the whole world is waiting for Christmas and New Year, the physicians of Wuhan, China, are astounded by clusters of patients suffering from  pneumonia from unknown causes. The pathogen isolated from the respiratory  epithelium of the patients is similar to previously known coronaviruses with some  distinct features. The disease was initially called nCoV-2019 or SARS-nCoV-2 and  later termed as COVID-19 by WHO. The infection is rapidly propagating from the  day of emergence, spread throughout the globe and now became a pandemic which  challenged the competencies of developed nations in terms of health care  management. As per WHO report, 216 countries are affected with SARS-CoV-19 by  August 5, 2020 with 18, 142, 718 confirmed cases and 691,013 deaths reports. Such  huge mortality and morbidity rates are truly threatening and calls for some  aggressive and effective measures to slow down the disease transmission. The  scientists are constantly engaged in finding a potential solution to diagnose and  treat the pandemic. Various FDA approved drugs with the previous history of  antiviral potency are repurposed for COVID-19 treatment. Different drugs and  vaccines are under clinical trials and some rapid and effective diagnostic tools  are also under development. In this review, we have highlighted the current  epidemiology through infographics, disease transmission and progression, clinical  features and diagnosis and possible therapeutic approaches for COVID-19. The  article mainly focused on the development and possible application of various FDA  approved drugs, including chloroquine, remdesivir, favipiravir, nefamostate  mesylate, penciclovir, nitazoxanide, ribavirin etc., vaccines under development  and various registered clinical trials exploring different therapeutic measures  for the treatment of COVID-19. This information will definitely help the  researchers to understand the in-line scientific progress by various clinical  agencies and regulatory bodies against COVID-19.

AB  - The recently emerged COVID-19 has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization as to date; no therapeutic drug/vaccine is available for the  treatment. Due to the lack of time and the urgency to contain the pandemic,  computational screening appears to be the best tool to find a therapeutic  solution. Accumulated evidence suggests that many phyto-compounds possess  anti-viral activity. Therefore, we identified possible phyto-compounds that could  be developed and used for COVID-19 treatment. In particular, molecular docking  was used to prioritize the possible active phyto-compounds against two key  targets namely RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and main protease (M(pro)) of  SARS-CoV-2. In this study, an antiviral drug- Remdesivir (RdRp inhibitor) and  Darunavir (M(pro) inhibitor) are used as reference drugs. This study revealed  that phyto-molecules- Mulberroside-A/C/E/F, Emblicanin A, Nimbolide, and  Punigluconin showed high binding affinity against RdRp while Andrographolides,  Mulberrosides, Anolignans, Chebulic acid, Mimusopic acid, and Punigluconin showed  better binding affinity against M(pro) as compared with the reference drug.  Furthermore, ADME profiles validated the drug-likeness properties of prioritized  phyto-compounds. Besides, to assess the stability, MD simulations studies were  performed along with reference inhibitors for M(pro) (Darunavir) and RdRp  (Remdesivir). Binding free energy calculations (MM-PBSA) revealed the estimated  value (ΔG) of M(pro)_Darunavir; M(pro)_Mulberroside E; RdRp_Remdesivir and  RdRp_Emblicanin A were -111.62 ± 6.788, -141.443 ± 9.313, 30.782 ± 5.85 and  -89.424 ± 3.130 kJmol(-1), respectively. Taken together, the study revealed the  potential of these phyto-compounds as inhibitors of RdRp and M(pro) inhibitor  that could be further validated against SARS-CoV-2 for clinical  benefits.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been responsible for the current global pandemic that has caused a death toll of >1.12 million  worldwide and number continues to climb in several countries. Currently, there  are neither specific antiviral drugs nor vaccines for the treatment and  prevention of COVID-19. We screened in silico, a group of natural spice and  herbal secondary metabolites (SMs) for their inhibition efficacy against multiple  target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 as well as the human angiotensin-converting enzyme  2 protein. Docking and simulation results indicated that epicatechin, embelin,  hesperidin, cafestol, murrayanine and murrayaquinone-A have higher inhibition  efficacy over at least one of the known antiviral drugs such as  Hydroxychloroquine, Remdesivir and Ribavirin. Combination of these potentially  effective SMs from their respective plant sources was analysed, and its  absorption and acute oral toxicity were examined in Wistar rats and classified as  category 5 as per the Globally Harmonized System. The identified SMs may be  useful in the development of preventive nutraceuticals, food supplements and  antiviral drugs.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

AB  - At present, there is no cure or vaccine for the devastating new highly infectious severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that has affected  people globally. Herein, we identified potent phytocompounds from two antiviral  plants Momordica charantia L. and Azadirachta indica used locally for the  treatment of viral and parasitic infections. Structure-based virtual screening  and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation have been employed to study their  inhibitory potential against the main protease (M(pro)) SARS-CoV-2. A total of 86  compounds from M. charantia L. and A. indica were identified. The top six  phytocompounds; momordicine, deacetylnimninene, margolonone, momordiciode F2,  nimbandiol, 17-hydroxyazadiradione were examined and when compared with three FDA  reference drugs (remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine and ribavirin). The top six  ranked compounds and FDA drugs were then subjected to MD simulation and  pharmacokinetic studies. These phytocompounds showed strong and stable  interactions with the active site amino acid residues of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro similar  to the reference compound. Results obtained from this study showed that  momordicine and momordiciode F2 exhibited good inhibition potential (best  MMGBA-binding energies; -41.1 and -43.4 kcal/mol) against the M(pro) of  SARS-CoV-2 when compared with FDA reference anti-viral drugs (Ribavirin,  remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine). Per-residue analysis, root mean square  deviation and solvent-accessible surface area revealed that compounds interacted  with key amino acid residues at the active site of the enzyme and showed good  system stability. The results obtained in this study show that these  phytocompounds could emerge as promising therapeutic inhibitors for the M(pro) of  SARS-CoV-2. However, urgent trials should be conducted to validate this  outcome.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

AB  - Given the highly contagious nature of SARS-CoV-2, it has resulted in an unprecedented number of COVID-19 infected and dead people worldwide. Since there  is currently no vaccine available in the market, the identification of potential  drugs is urgently needed to control the pandemic. In this study, 92  phytochemicals from medicinal plants growing in the Andean region were screened  against SARS-CoV-2 3 C-like protease (3CLpro) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase  (RdRp) in their active sites through molecular docking. The cutoff values were  set from the lowest docking scores of the FDA-approved drugs that are being used  to treat COVID-19 patients (remdesivir, lopinavir, and ritonavir). Compounds with  docking scores that were lower than cutoff values were validated by molecular  dynamics simulation with GROMACS, using root mean square deviation (RMSD), root  mean square fluctuation (RMSF), radius of gyration (Rg), and intermolecular  hydrogen bonds (H-bonds). Furthermore, binding free energies were estimated using  the MM-PBSA method, and ADMET profiles of potential inhibitors were assessed.  Computational analyses revealed that the interaction with hesperidin (theoretical  binding energies, ΔG(bind) = -15.18 kcal/mol to 3CLpro and ΔG(bind) =  -9.46 kcal/mol to RdRp) remained stable in both enzymes, unveiling its remarkable  potential as a possible multitarget antiviral agent to treat COVID-19.  Importantly, lupinifolin with an estimated binding affinity to 3CLpro higher than  hesperidin (ΔG(bind) = -20.93 kcal/mol) is also a potential inhibitor of the  3CLpro. These two compounds displayed suitable pharmacological and structural  properties to be drug candidates, demonstrating to be worthy of further  research.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the data currently available regarding the repurposing of different drugs for COVID-19  treatment. Participants with suspected or diagnosed COVID-19 were included in  this study. The interventions that have been considered were repurposed drugs and  comparators that included standard of care treatment or placebo. EVIDENCE  ACQUISITION: We searched Ovid-MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane library, clinical trial  registration site in the UK(NIHR), Europe (clinicaltrialsregister.eu), US  (ClinicalTrials.gov) and internationally (isrctn.com), and reviewed the reference  lists of articles for eligible articles published up to April 22, 2020. All  studies in English that evaluated the efficacy of the listed drugs were included.  Cochrane RoB 2.0 and ROBINS-I tool were used to assess study quality. This  systematic review adheres to the PRISMA guidelines. The protocol is available at  PROSPERO (CRD42020180915). EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: From 708 identified studies or  clinical trials, 16 studies and 16 case reports met our eligibility criteria. Of  these, 6 were randomized controlled trials (763 patients), 7 cohort studies (321  patients) and 3 case series (191 patients). Chloroquine (CQ) had a 100% discharge  rate compared to 50% with lopinavir-ritonavir at day 14, however a trial has  recommended against a high dosage due to cardiotoxic events. Hydroxychloroquine  (HCQ) has shown no significant improvement in negative seroconversion rate which  is also seen in our meta-analysis (P=0.68). Adverse events with HCQ have a  significant difference compared to the control group (P=0.001).  Lopinavir-ritonavir has shown no improvement in time to clinical improvement  which is seen in our meta-analyses (P=0.1). Remdesivir has shown no significant  improvement in time to clinical improvement but this trial had insufficient  power. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the paucity in evidence, it is difficult to establish  the efficacy of these drugs in the treatment of COVID-19 as currently there is no  significant clinical effectiveness of the repurposed drugs. Further large  clinical trials are required to achieve more reliable findings. A risk-benefit  analysis is required on an individual basis to weigh out the potential  improvement in clinical outcome and viral load reduction compared to the risks of  the adverse events.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The outburst of the novel coronavirus COVID-19, at the end of December 2019 has turned into a pandemic, risking many human lives. The causal  agent being SARS-CoV-2, a member of the long-known Coronaviridae family, is a  positive-sense single-stranded enveloped virus and closely related to SARS-CoV.  It has become the need of the hour to understand the pathophysiology of this  disease, so that drugs, vaccines, treatment regimens and plausible therapeutic  agents can be produced. METHODS: In this regard, recent studies uncovered the  fact that the viral genome of SARS-CoV-2 encodes non-structural proteins like  RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) which is an important tool for its  transcription and replication process. A large number of nucleic acid-based  anti-viral drugs are being repurposed for treating COVID-19 targeting RdRp. Few  of them are at the advanced stage of clinical trials, including remdesivir. While  performing a detailed investigation of the large set of nucleic acid-based drugs,  we were surprised to find that the synthetic nucleic acid backbone has been  explored very little or rare. RESULTS: We designed scaffolds derived from peptide  nucleic acid (PNA) and subjected them to in- -silico screening systematically.  These designed molecules have demonstrated excellent binding towards RdRp.  Compound 12 was found to possess a similar binding affinity as remdesivir with  comparable pharmacokinetics. However, the in-silico toxicity prediction indicates  that compound 12 may be a superior molecule which can be explored further due to  its excellent safety-profile with LD50 12,000mg/kg as opposed to remdesivir (LD50  =1000mg/kg). CONCLUSION: Compound 12 falls in the safe category of class 6.  Synthetic feasibility, equipotent binding and very low toxicity of this peptide  nucleic acid-derived compound can make it a leading scaffold to design,  synthesize and evaluate many similar compounds for the treatment of COVID-19.

AB  - The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused a worldwide outbreak of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), which rapidly evolved  as a global concern. The efforts of the scientific community are pointed towards  the identification of promptly available therapeutic options. RNA-dependent RNA  polymerase (RdRp) is a promising target for developing small molecules to  contrast SARS-CoV-2 replication. Modern computational tools can boost  identification and repurposing of known drugs targeting RdRp. We here report the  results regarding the screening of a database containing more than 8800  molecules, including approved, experimental, nutraceutical, illicit, withdrawn  and investigational compounds. The molecules were docked against the  cryo-electron microscopy structure of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, optimized by means of  molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The adopted three-stage ensemble docking  study underline that compounds formerly developed as kinase inhibitors may  interact with RdRp.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

T2  - International journal of health policy and management
AB  - Public investment, through both research grants and university funding, plays a crucial role in the research and development (R&D) of novel health technologies,  including diagnostics, therapies, and vaccines, to address the coronavirus  disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Using the example of remdesivir, one of the  most promising COVID-19 treatments, this paper traces back public contributions  to different stages of the innovation process. Applying the Risk-Reward Nexus  framework to the R&D of remdesivir, we analyse the role of the public in  risk-taking and reward and address inequities in the biomedical innovation  system. We discuss the collective, cumulative and uncertain characteristics of  innovation, highlighting the lack of transparency in the biomedical R&D system,  the need for public investment in the innovation process, and the "time-lag"  between risk-taking and reward. Despite the significant public transnational  contributions to the R&D of remdesivir, the rewards are extracted by few actors  and the return to the public in the form of equitable access and affordable  pricing is limited. Beyond the necessity to treat remdesivir as a global public  good, we argue that biomedical innovation needs to be viewed in the broader  concept of public value to prevent the same equity issues currently seen in the  COVID-19 pandemic. This requires the state to take a market-shaping rather than  market-fixing role, thereby steering innovation, ensuring that patents do not  hinder global equitable access and affordable pricing and safeguarding a global  medicines supply.

AB  - BACKGROUND: New treatment modalities are urgently needed for patients with COVID-19. The World Health Organization (WHO) Solidarity trial showed no effect  of remdesivir or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) on mortality, but the antiviral effects  of these drugs are not known. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of remdesivir  and HCQ on all-cause, in-hospital mortality; the degree of respiratory failure  and inflammation; and viral clearance in the oropharynx. DESIGN: NOR-Solidarity  is an independent, add-on, randomized controlled trial to the WHO Solidarity  trial that included biobanking and 3 months of clinical follow-up  (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04321616). SETTING: 23 hospitals in Norway. PATIENTS:  Eligible patients were adults hospitalized with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.  INTERVENTION: Between 28 March and 4 October 2020, a total of 185 patients were  randomly assigned and 181 were included in the full analysis set. Patients  received remdesivir (n = 42), HCQ (n = 52), or standard of care (SoC) (n = 87).  MEASUREMENTS: In addition to the primary end point of WHO Solidarity,  study-specific outcomes were viral clearance in oropharyngeal specimens, the  degree of respiratory failure, and inflammatory variables. RESULTS: No  significant differences were seen between treatment groups in mortality during  hospitalization. There was a marked decrease in SARS-CoV-2 load in the oropharynx  during the first week overall, with similar decreases and 10-day viral loads  among the remdesivir, HCQ, and SoC groups. Remdesivir and HCQ did not affect the  degree of respiratory failure or inflammatory variables in plasma or serum. The  lack of antiviral effect was not associated with symptom duration, level of viral  load, degree of inflammation, or presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 at  hospital admittance. LIMITATION: The trial had no placebo group. CONCLUSION:  Neither remdesivir nor HCQ affected viral clearance in hospitalized patients with  COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: When the world was frantically searching for a drug effective against the coronavirus disease (COVID)-19, remdesivir, a  broad-spectrum anti-viral medication, became a part of the COVID treatment. We  planned a study to evaluate improvement in clinical outcomes with remdesivir  treatment for five days. METHODS: Participants more than 40-years old and with  moderate to severe COVID-19 but not on mechanical ventilation were randomly  assigned into two groups-remdesivir group (34 cases) to receive the study drug  intravenous (IV) remdesivir for five days plus the standard care (SC) and  non-remdesivir group (36 cases) to receive the SC but not to receive the study  drug. Follow-up was continued for 12 days after the beginning of treatment or  until discharge/death. Patient's clinical status was assessed by laboratory  investigations and physical examination (from day 1 to day 12 on a 4-point  ordinal scale and from day 12 to 24 on a 6-point ordinal scale). Oxygen support  requirements and adverse events were recorded. The data were entered and analysed  using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22.0. RESULTS:  High-flow oxygen support and non-invasive ventilation was required at baseline by  lesser patients in the remdesivir group. In the end, both groups had similar  outcomes after adjustment for baseline clinical status. There was no statistical  difference in mortality between the two groups (p = 0.749). Patients in both  groups had an equal time to recovery. There was no difference in the occurrence  of adverse effects of remdesivir between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Remdesivir  therapy for five days did not produce improvement in clinical outcomes in  moderate to severe COVID-19 cases.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Remdesivir demonstrated clinical benefit in a placebo-controlled trial in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but its effect  in patients with moderate disease is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine the  efficacy of 5 or 10 days of remdesivir treatment compared with standard care on  clinical status on day 11 after initiation of treatment. DESIGN, SETTING, AND  PARTICIPANTS: Randomized, open-label trial of hospitalized patients with  confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection  and moderate COVID-19 pneumonia (pulmonary infiltrates and room-air oxygen  saturation >94%) enrolled from March 15 through April 18, 2020, at 105 hospitals  in the United States, Europe, and Asia. The date of final follow-up was May 20,  2020. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a  10-day course of remdesivir (n = 197), a 5-day course of remdesivir (n = 199), or  standard care (n = 200). Remdesivir was dosed intravenously at 200 mg on day 1  followed by 100 mg/d. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was  clinical status on day 11 on a 7-point ordinal scale ranging from death (category  1) to discharged (category 7). Differences between remdesivir treatment groups  and standard care were calculated using proportional odds models and expressed as  odds ratios. An odds ratio greater than 1 indicates difference in clinical status  distribution toward category 7 for the remdesivir group vs the standard care  group. RESULTS: Among 596 patients who were randomized, 584 began the study and  received remdesivir or continued standard care (median age, 57 [interquartile  range, 46-66] years; 227 [39%] women; 56% had cardiovascular disease, 42%  hypertension, and 40% diabetes), and 533 (91%) completed the trial. Median length  of treatment was 5 days for patients in the 5-day remdesivir group and 6 days for  patients in the 10-day remdesivir group. On day 11, patients in the 5-day  remdesivir group had statistically significantly higher odds of a better clinical  status distribution than those receiving standard care (odds ratio, 1.65; 95% CI,  1.09-2.48; P = .02). The clinical status distribution on day 11 between the  10-day remdesivir and standard care groups was not significantly different  (P = .18 by Wilcoxon rank sum test). By day 28, 9 patients had died: 2 (1%) in  the 5-day remdesivir group, 3 (2%) in the 10-day remdesivir group, and 4 (2%) in  the standard care group. Nausea (10% vs 3%), hypokalemia (6% vs 2%), and headache  (5% vs 3%) were more frequent among remdesivir-treated patients compared with  standard care. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with moderate COVID-19,  those randomized to a 10-day course of remdesivir did not have a statistically  significant difference in clinical status compared with standard care at 11 days  after initiation of treatment. Patients randomized to a 5-day course of  remdesivir had a statistically significant difference in clinical status compared  with standard care, but the difference was of uncertain clinical importance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: No specific antiviral drug has been proven effective for treatment of patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Remdesivir (GS-5734), a  nucleoside analogue prodrug, has inhibitory effects on pathogenic animal and  human coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  (SARS-CoV-2) in vitro, and inhibits Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus,  SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2 replication in animal models. METHODS: We did a  randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial at ten hospitals  in Hubei, China. Eligible patients were adults (aged ≥18 years) admitted to  hospital with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, with an interval from  symptom onset to enrolment of 12 days or less, oxygen saturation of 94% or less  on room air or a ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired  oxygen of 300 mm Hg or less, and radiologically confirmed pneumonia. Patients  were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to intravenous remdesivir (200 mg on day 1  followed by 100 mg on days 2-10 in single daily infusions) or the same volume of  placebo infusions for 10 days. Patients were permitted concomitant use of  lopinavir-ritonavir, interferons, and corticosteroids. The primary endpoint was  time to clinical improvement up to day 28, defined as the time (in days) from  randomisation to the point of a decline of two levels on a six-point ordinal  scale of clinical status (from 1=discharged to 6=death) or discharged alive from  hospital, whichever came first. Primary analysis was done in the  intention-to-treat (ITT) population and safety analysis was done in all patients  who started their assigned treatment. This trial is registered with  ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04257656. FINDINGS: Between Feb 6, 2020, and March 12,  2020, 237 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to a treatment group (158  to remdesivir and 79 to placebo); one patient in the placebo group who withdrew  after randomisation was not included in the ITT population. Remdesivir use was  not associated with a difference in time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio  1·23 [95% CI 0·87-1·75]). Although not statistically significant, patients  receiving remdesivir had a numerically faster time to clinical improvement than  those receiving placebo among patients with symptom duration of 10 days or less  (hazard ratio 1·52 [0·95-2·43]). Adverse events were reported in 102 (66%) of 155  remdesivir recipients versus 50 (64%) of 78 placebo recipients. Remdesivir was  stopped early because of adverse events in 18 (12%) patients versus four (5%)  patients who stopped placebo early. INTERPRETATION: In this study of adult  patients admitted to hospital for severe COVID-19, remdesivir was not associated  with statistically significant clinical benefits. However, the numerical  reduction in time to clinical improvement in those treated earlier requires  confirmation in larger studies.
