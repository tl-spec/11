| **Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)** | \( \text{SSIM}(x, y) = \frac{(2 \mu_x \mu_y + c_1)(2 \sigma_{xy} + c_2)}{(\mu_x^2 + \mu_y^2 + c_1)(\sigma_x^2 + \sigma_y^2 + c_2)} \) | Evaluates the similarity between two saliency maps, assessing robustness under slight input noise. |
| **Faithfulness Estimate**           | \( \text{Faithfulness Estimate} = \text{confidence}(x) - \text{confidence}(x_{\text{perturbed}}) \) | Checks if the saliency map accurately reflects critical features that contribute to the model’s prediction. |
| **Softmax Information Curve (SIC)** | -                                                                                                   | Measures the model's softmax probability change as important features are removed. |
| **Accuracy Information Curve (AIC)**| -                                                                                                   | Measures the change in model accuracy as important features are removed. |

| **Removal of Most Relevant Features (MoRF)** | \( \text{Accuracy drop} = \text{accuracy}(x) - \text{accuracy}(x_{\text{MoRF}}) \)          | Tests the impact of removing key features from the saliency map on model accuracy, indicating feature discriminativeness. |
